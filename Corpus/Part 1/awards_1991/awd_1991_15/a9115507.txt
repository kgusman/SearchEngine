Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The influence of solar changes on decadal-to-millennial                   
              scale climate variability is a matter of some dispute.  In a                   
              previous study the PIs correlated atmospheric 14C records with a               
              number of different indices of climate and found that the                      
              correspondence was quite weak for many records.  However, the                  
              correlation was significantly higher for one record in China, and              
              other studies continue to provide some support for a sun-climate               
              connection.  The PIs therefore believe it is appropriate to                    
              suggest a sun-climate connection that may be statistically                     
              significant, but at the same time contributes only a modest                    
              amount of the variance to centennial-scale climate change.                     
              Viewed from this perspective, several objectives for further work              
              suggest themselves; expanded analysis of climate records in order              
              to more systematically examine the sun-climate connection, with                
              special emphasis on trying to determine the amount of variance                 
              explained by any significant correlations, and whether there is                
              some larger-scale coherence to regions of poor or good                         
              correlation.  It is also necessary to determine whether the                    
              proposed sensitivity of the climate system on centennial-time                  
              scales is consistent with both solar and climate models.  The PIs              
              therefore specifically propose the following:  (1) refined                     
              statistical analyses of a greater number of paleoclimate records,              
              including climate correlations with both 14C and 10Be solar                    
              indices; and (2) modeling the geographic response to periodic                  
              solar constant variations.  This research should help clarify the              
              significance of a sun-climate connection, and perhaps why some                 
              records seem to show a connection while others do not.
