Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The current reform movement in mathematics education                      
              emphasizes the importance of students constructing their own                   
              knowledge in an atmosphere  that encourages sharing of                         
              ideas, justification of mathematical assertions, and                           
              creation of shared meaning for the mathematics being                           
              learned.  Research has begun to shed light on the social                       
              processes by which this can occur, but has largely ignored                     
              questions of how mathematical structure is communicated,                       
              particularly at upper grade levels.  Issues of how both                        
              teachers and students view mathematics, especially the need                    
              for justification of mathematical assertions, also become                      
              critical at this level.  The purpose of this study is to                       
              investigate (1) ways in which language serves as a mediator                    
              of beliefs about mathematics; (2) ways in which mathematicl                    
              structure is communicated, particularly through use of                         
              metaphor and analogy; (3) how an appreciation for                              
              mathematical justification develops in classrooms; and (4)                     
              how new teachers are socialized into patterns of classroom                     
              discourse.  The study will be interpretive, the data                           
              consisting largely of fieldnotes, interviews and transcribed                   
              audiotapes of classroom discourse.  The research will                          
              suggest ways in which goals of the current reform movement                     
              can better be met, both by improving discourse patterns and                    
              by improving the ways in which new teachers adopt discourse                    
              patterns.
