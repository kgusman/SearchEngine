Abstract    :
                   Continental growth by the accretion of microcontinental                   
              terranes is an important but poorly understood orogenic process.               
              The Wrangellia-Alexander superterrane is one of the best                       
              documented microcontinents in the western Cordillera, yet little               
              is known of its tectonic and depositional history immediately                  
              prior to its Cretaceous accretion.  This project is a detailed                 
              study of the provenance and sedimentology of the Seymour Canal                 
              Formation of the Gravina belt, and Jura-Cretaceous sequence of                 
              flysch and volcanic rocks deposited on the inboard slope of the                
              Wrangellia-Alexander microcontinent prior to final closure, in                 
              order to constrain the nature of this collision.  The project                  
              will focus on little-metamorphosed portions of the Gravina belt,               
              and carry out petrographic studies of sandstones and conglomerate              
              clasts, coupled with mineral chemistry studies of plagioclase and              
              clinopyroxene in sandstones and igneous rocks to establish                     
              provenance and tectonic setting.  It will integrate turbidite                  
              lithofacies analysis and ichnofacies and paleo- current studies                
              in order to reconstruct basin history, and refine the temporal                 
              framework of deposition by combining new microfossil                           
              biostratigraphy with radiometric dating of volcanic and detrital               
              biotite and hornblende grains using Argon 40/39 methods.  These                
              studies will help document sedimentologic and tectonic processes               
              operative in this microcontinent collision, and may serve as a                 
              pilot study for other, more enigmatic Jura-Cretaceous flysch                   
              basins of the Cordilleran.
