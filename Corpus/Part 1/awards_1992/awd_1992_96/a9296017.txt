Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a two-ship multichannel seismic field program                     
              that will provide the first detailed geophysical constraints on                
              the crustal structure along the East Pacific Rise south of the                 
              Garrett fracture zone. Three types of data will be collected:                  
              (1) twenty closely-space, single-ship multichannel seismic                     
              reflection profiles along the East Pacific Rise; (2) twenty-                   
              five two-ship expanding spread profiles along and parallel to                  
              the rise axis in this same area; and (3) a 700-km-long                         
              multichanel seismic reflection profile along the East Pacific                  
              Rise from the Garrett fracture zone to the large overlapping                   
              spreading center at 20.5S. These data will be used to test the                 
              spreading rate dependence of magma chamber size predicted by                   
              many ridge crest thermal models, examine the relationship                      
              between crustal magma chambers andalong-axis changes in                        
              morphology, segmentation and basalt geochemistry, and to                       
              resolve better how the first-order seismic structure of oceanic                
              crust, including Moho and seismic layer 3, developed during the                
              first few hundred thousand years after crustal formation. The                  
              section of the East Pacific Rise south of the Garrett fracture                 
              zone is to be a major focus of the RIDGE initiative.
