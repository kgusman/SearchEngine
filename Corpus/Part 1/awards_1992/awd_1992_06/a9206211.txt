Abstract    :
                   The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships               
              are awards to recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the                     
              mathematical sciences.  These awards are a means of contributing to            
              the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.  As                
              researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their interactions             
              with other disciplines, and as the interplay increases between the             
              various areas of mathematics itself, opportunities for postdoctoral            
              research and training are becoming increasingly important.  The                
              fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research                 
              environments that will have maximal impact on their future                     
              scientific development.  The fellowship is designed to provide 24              
              months of support divided into 18 academic-year months and 3                   
              periods of two summer months.  The recipient may choose (1) the                
              Research Fellowship option which allows for full-time support for              
              any 18 academic-year months in a three-year period, in intervals               
              not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research                      
              Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic year              
              support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support and 18 months             
              of half-time support.  Not more than two months of summer support              
              from this Fellowship may be received in any calendar year.                     
                   Mary Ann Horn wiil receive her doctoral degree from the                   
              University of Virginia, and will pursue research under the guidance            
              of Walter Littman at the University of Minnesota.  The research                
              will be conducted in the area of exact controllability and                     
              stabilization of nonlinear plate equations.
