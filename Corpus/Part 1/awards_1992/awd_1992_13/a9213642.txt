Abstract    :
              Scientists, engineers, humanities scholars and social scientists               
              from the Acadia Institute, California Institute of Technology,                 
              Dartmouth College, Illinois Insititue of Technology, Loyola                    
              University-Chicago, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are              
              forming a two-year consortium to create teaching materials to                  
              teach academic research ethics to graduate students of science                 
              and engineering.  The consortium includes a team of two from each              
              institution, and will create at least six modules on specific                  
              topics in research ethics.  The modules, paperbound books                      
              consisting of 100 to 125 pages, will address such issues as                    
              research methodology, professional honesty, reporting on                       
              research, whistleblowing and loyalty, and animals and human                    
              subjects in research.  Each module will contain reprints, cases,               
              analyses, appropriate federal and professional guidelines and                  
              bibliographies.  Authorship for each module will be                            
              interdisciplinary and inter-campus, and the content will benefit               
              from the uniquely collaborative approach of this project.  During              
              the grant period, each campus team will facilitate a seminar on                
              research ethics.  The seminars will include faculty members,                   
              post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students.                    
              Seminar participants will evaluate modules in progress.                        
              Ultimately, the modules will be published as a series through                  
              University Press of New England and offered individually to                    
              scientific and engineering professional societies.
