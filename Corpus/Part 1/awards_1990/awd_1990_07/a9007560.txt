Abstract    :
                   Funds are requested to move a 50-MHz spaced antenna/imaging               
              Doppler interferometer system to a location near the Flatland                  
              radar in Illinois and to operate it there for a period of three                
              years.  The goal is to establish a mesoscale network near Urbana               
              consisting of three radars in a triangular array with an average               
              separation of approximately 20 km.  The addition of the new                    
              facility to the two radars already operating near Urbana will                  
              allow measurements of a number of parameters important in the                  
              evolution of mesoscale and microscale meteorological systems,                  
              including horizontal and vertical velocities, vorticity,                       
              divergence, shears, deformation, and the vorticity equation                    
              tilting terms.  The special capabilities of the spaced                         
              antenna/IDI system will also allow a study of the scattering                   
              mechanisms responsible for the echoes, the tilts of isentropic                 
              surfaces, and possibly the small-scale vorticity, divergence, and              
              vorticity tilting terms on a spatial scale of 30-50 m, i.e., the               
              scale characteristic of the separation of the antennas in the                  
              spaced antenna system.  The addition of a third radar to the                   
              network increases the information that can be derived and the                  
              number of studies that can be carried out by more than a factor                
              of ten over what can be achieved with either a single radar or                 
              dual radar.
