Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research on the geometry and                      
              analysis of locally symmetric spaces and manifolds of negative                 
              curvature of Professor Svetlana Katok of the University of                     
              California at Santa Cruz. Dr. Katok's project consists of two                  
              main parts: first, she intends to study the cohomological                      
              equations associated with geodesic flows on compact negatively                 
              curved surfaces; and second, she will generalize spanning                      
              theorems that she has already proved for automorphic forms on                  
              Fuchsian groups to locally symmetric spaces of dimension greater               
              than two.                                                                      
                   Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                
              century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                    
              century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                      
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                 
              rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                   
              study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.              
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, as                     
              exemplified by the work of Professor Katok, it retains connection              
              to its historical roots.
