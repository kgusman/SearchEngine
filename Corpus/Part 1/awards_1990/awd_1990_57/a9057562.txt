Abstract    :
              This work aims to develop a declarative paradigm of programming,               
              based on flexible constructs that can deal efficiently with large              
              volumes of data.  Commercial query languages and logic programs                
              both extend relational algebra, which is a simple fragment of                  
              first-order logic.  These languages are declarative, in that                   
              their semantics can be specified non-operationally.  Programs can              
              thus be viewed as high-level specifications and are easier to                  
              develop, understand and maintain, and there is much promise for                
              parallel execution.  Current implementation techniques that                    
              support logic programming cannot handle large volumes of data,                 
              and techniques for relational query languages cannot implement                 
              recursion, to name two limitations.  This work explores an                     
              approach based on program transformation followed by fixpoint                  
              evaluation that combines the focussing properties of logic                     
              program oriented techniques with the efficient set-oriented                    
              processing of relational techniques.  In addition to the                       
              challenges of efficient implementation, many aspects of the                    
              declarative programming paradigm, such as the right combination                
              of features, the role of data abstraction and object identity,                 
              the semantics of negation and updates, and facilities for program              
              development and debugging are also being studied, and a prototype              
              language called Coral is being developed.
