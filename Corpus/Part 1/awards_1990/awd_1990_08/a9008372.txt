Abstract    :
              This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two                
              years.  This project is entitled "The Role of the Rhodobacter                  
              spheroides groEL Protein in the Assembly of the Ribulose 1.5                   
              bisphoshate carboxylase/oxygenase".  The research Fellowships in               
              Plant Biology are granted to applicants trained in traditional                 
              areas of plant biology who wish to extend their training in new                
              techniques and to those trained in molecular or cellular                       
              techniques who wish to gain experience working with plants.                    
              These fellowships are designed to increase the number of                       
              outstanding young scientists in plant biology.
