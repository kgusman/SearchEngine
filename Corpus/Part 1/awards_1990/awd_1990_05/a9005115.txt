Abstract    :
              This project, by a group of outstanding young observational                    
              astronomers, aims at an understanding of the properties of                     
              extremely faint galaxies. These objects dominate the universe in               
              terms of numbers, although their contribution to the total mass                
              is poorly known.  Indeed, most of our knowledge of star formation              
              in external galaxies, and of galaxy properties in general has                  
              come from studies of systems which may not be typical.  These                  
              workers will explore the properties of these much more numerous                
              objects by both optical and radio means.  Preliminary work by                  
              these investigators has already resulted in the discovery of the               
              two largest, most gas-rich spiral galaxies known, both systems of              
              very low surface brightness.
