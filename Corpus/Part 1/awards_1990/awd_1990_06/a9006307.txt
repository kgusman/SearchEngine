Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project ARRCC: Analysis of Rapid and Recent Climate Change                     
                                                                                             
                   Climatic changes on time scales of years to centuries                     
              have the most direct impact on society and humanity.  Yet changes              
              on these time scales are hard to predict because we have yet to                
              isolate climate forcing factors in this frequency range.  Project              
              ARRCC aims to evaluate past variations in climate on annual to                 
              century time scales in order to develop a better understanding of              
              the types and magnitude of the changes observed as well as to                  
              evaluate two potential causes: changes in solar activity and the               
              effects of volcanic aerosol input into the atmosphere. Project                 
              ARRCC will produce detailed time series of climate variations for              
              the last 500 years, an interval which includes the Little Ice                  
              Age.  During this interval there was also a significant reduction              
              in the number of sunspots (the Maunder Minimum) leading many                   
              researchers to suggest some causal relationship.  The PIs in                   
              Project ARRCC will synthesize the quantitative paleoclimate data               
              for this time interval and compare the results to model                        
              simulations which vary the intensity of incoming solar radiation               
              and the reflectivity of the atmosphere because of changes in                   
              volcanic aerosol concentration.  This research is important for                
              three reasons: 1) it will be the first synthesis of this                       
              important paleoclimate event; 2) it will produce a rigorous,                   
              global data base of past climate for use by other researchers;                 
              and 3) it will be the first rigorous attempt to quantify the                   
              effects of solar radiation and volcanic activity on climate                    
              change.  This research is a high-priorty for the US Global Change              
              Research Program.
