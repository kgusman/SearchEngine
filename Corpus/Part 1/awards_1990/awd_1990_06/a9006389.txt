Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Committee on Vision (CoVIS) is a standing committee of the                 
              National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences,                 
              which is supported by contributions from several federal                       
              agencies.  It provides analysis and advice to those sponsoring                 
              agencies, on issues involving the human visual system, including               
              questions of physiological and physical optics, neurophysiology,               
              psychophysics, perception, engineering and equipment, computer                 
              vision, environmental effects on vision, and visual disorders.                 
              The committee of twelve members helps select and define                        
              activities of several working groups dealing with specific topics              
              of concern to the sponsors.  Results of this work are published                
              in reports available to scientists, the public, and to industry,               
              and have impact on many areas of vision science.
