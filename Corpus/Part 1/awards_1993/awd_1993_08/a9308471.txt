Abstract    :
                   The proposed research has three components: (a) The study of              
              direct and inverse problems for acoustic pulse reflection from                 
              randomly layered media, (b) the study of the focusing singularity              
              of the nonlinear Schroedinger and related equations, and (c)                   
              convection enhanced diffusion. In pulse reflection a statistical               
              theory will be developed for reflected signals generated by                    
              pulses emitted by a point source located on the surface or above               
              a randomly layered half space.  The range of validity of the                   
              theory, based on the asymptotic theory of stochastic equations,                
              will be explored with numerical simulations.  For pulsed plane                 
              waves incident on a randomly layered half space, a number of                   
              statistical inverse problems will be formulated and solved, where              
              properties of the medium are based on the statistics of the                    
              observed reflected signals.                                                    
                   The work on pulse reflection is of direct interest in                     
              exploration seismology and to a lesser extent in connection with               
              the detection of seismic events that are natural or man-made.                  
              The work on the nonlinear Schroedinger equation is useful in                   
              nonlinear optics for laser surgery, for example, and in laser                  
              fusion.  The work on convection-diffusion is useful in the study               
              of dispersion of pollutants in various environments such as the                
              ocean and the atmosphere.
