              physiological studies of glial cells did not detect voltage and time-activated
              ion channels in glial cells; however, more recent cell culture studies
              demonstrate that astrocytes can express         Y       a variety of ion
              channels, including voltage activated Na   +   , K   +   , and Ca   2+   
              channels, previously thought to be restricted to neurons.  In contrast to
              neurons, these channels are not involved in cell-cell signaling but are
              important in maintaining ion homeostasis in the brain.  Voltage-activated
              channels have been described in astrocytes from numerous CNS regions and those
              studies revealed a significant degree of heterogeneity.  However, in all those
              previous studies little attention has been paid to the question of whether the
              cells' microenvironment influences the expression and/or activity of astrocyte
              ion channels.  Since astrocytes in the intact CNS are always surrounded by
              other cells, particularly neurons, and are exposed to different extracellular
              milieus, it is important to understand how such factors influence astrocyte
              physiology.  The proposed project is designed to study factors that modulate
              ion channel activity in astrocytes.  It has been widely reported that ion
              channels expressed in excitable cells contain kinase phosphorylation sites, and
              that activation of protein kinases can directly modulate channel activity.  It
              is proposed to study whether protein kinase mediated phosphorylation can also
              influence ion channel activity in astrocytes.  The two most prominent protein
              kinases known to         Y K     modulate ion channels, cAMP-dependent protein
              kinase (PKA) and Ca   2+   -depen dent protein kinase (PKC), can be selectively
              stimulated by neuroactive compounds, such as the activation of beta-adrenergic
              receptors by epinephrine which stimulates PKA activity.  Dr. Sontheimer will
              utilize a number of well-characterized activators and inhibitors of PKA and
              PKC, as well as specific neuroligands known to stimulate these second messenger
              pathways.  These studies will pay particular attention to the effects of these
              agents on astrocyte ion channels that have been         Y       demonstrated to
              play key roles in maintaining K   +    homeostasis in the CNS, such as K   +   
              channels         Y       and Na   +    channels, which serve as a vital return
              pathway for Na   +   /K   +   ATPase. ***
