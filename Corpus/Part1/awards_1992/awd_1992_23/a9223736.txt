Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In 1930, consumption fell more rapidly than is explained by income             
              declines, turning a bad recession into the Great Depression.  Yet              
              despite its importance, this drop remains unexplained.  This                   
              project offers an explanation.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Household indebtedness stood at an unprecedented high in 1929.                 
              Much of this was installment debt.  Default on an installment                  
              contract resulted in wealth-reducing repossession without                      
              compensation.  Although installment payments were up to 30 percent             
              of monthly pay, households did not default when income fell in                 
              1930.  This project suggests the unexplained drop in consumption               
              was the means by which households avoided default: when households             
              anticipated wage cuts, they immediately reduced consumption so they            
              could pay off their debts and avoid costly default.  The project               
              illustrates the importance of institutional characteristics.                   
              Subsequent change in default consequences lessened the sensitivity             
              of consumption to current income fluctuations.                                 
                                                                                             
              This project pursues the analysis of two existing household surveys            
              of income and expenditure; coding and analysis of a household                  
              survey covering the years 1928 and 1933 for the same families;                 
              analysis of the pattern of wage cuts in the 1930s; and historical              
              analysis of the legal environment governing default consequences,              
              the extent of default, the prices of used durable goods, and the               
              impact of the practices of collateralization and securitization on             
              a lender's ability to adjust existing credit terms.
