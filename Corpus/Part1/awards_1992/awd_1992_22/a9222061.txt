              Andreadis  The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are progressive neural
              degeneration with accompanying loss of mental function.  Connected to the
              phenomenon of neuronal abnormality is a protein molecule named tau.  In normal
              brain tau stabilizes microtubules and probably contributes to the organization
              and maintenance of neuron shape (and therefore function).  In the brain of
              Alzhemer's patients tau appears in characteristic diagnostic assemblages of
              dead and dying neurons, the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).  The tau gene
              produces a number of variant protein forms by a process called splicing, which
              is strictly regulated.  The tau protein found within the NFTs is a v ariant
              abnormal with respect to both its cellular location and its particular form;
              the implication is that in AD the regulation of tau may have gone awry and may
              directly or indirectly affect neurons.  The goal of this research proposal is
              to understand how tau splicing is regulated, in the hope of getting closer to
              discovering the molecular cause of AD and/or developing useful probes for its
              early stages. ***
