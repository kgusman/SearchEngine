Abstract    :
              The purpose of this collaborative research is to analyze, from a               
              theoretical perspective, a number of aspects of recent regulatory              
              reform in the U.S.  The project will focus on three broad areas:               
              (1) The management of competition in regulated industries; (2)                 
              The optimal design of regulatory policy; and (3)  The                          
              implementation of price-cap regulation.  In the first part, the                
              investigators will explore, from a theoretical perspective, how                
              to combine in an optimum way competition and regulation in                     
              regulated industries such a electric power, telecommunications,                
              and transportation.  In the second part, research will be                      
              directed at analyzing the implications of regulatory commissions               
              holding regulated industries, such as public utilities, fully                  
              responsible for decisions having unfavorable outcomes, while at                
              the same time allowing only meager rewards for favorable                       
              outcomes.  The third part of the project will analyze the                      
              implications of price-cap regulation which many state regulatory               
              commissions have adopted to control intrastate phone rates.  This              
              project is important because it will provide a more fundamental                
              understanding of the impact of alternative regulation regimes on               
              the performance of regulated industries.
