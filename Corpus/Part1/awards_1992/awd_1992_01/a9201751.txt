Abstract    :
                 This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The               
              long-term goal of this research is the recovery of accurate                    
              camera motion and dense three-dimensional shape information from               
              television images at video rate.  In prior work, the Principal                 
              Investigator developed a matrix-based factorization method for                 
              this task, based on a set of feature points tracked from frame to              
              frame of a dense image sequence.  Experiments with the method                  
              demonstrated a dramatic performance improvement over existing                  
              shape and motion recovery systems.  This research will now                     
              develop a characterization of the noise sensitivity of image                   
              sequence analysis, explore efficient and incremental numerical                 
              methods for factorization, and reformulate the method for                      
              perspective projection, multiple motions, and dense shape                      
              results.  As an exploratory advance into a new area of research                
              an investigation of the link between motion analysis and multi-                
              frame of object recognition will also be conducted.  This                      
              research should contribute to a better theoretical understanding               
              of visual motion analysis, and produce a vision module that would              
              let a robot localize itself in the environment, draw a map of its              
              own surroundings for navigation and obstacle avoidance, and                    
              perceive the shape of objects in order to recognize or manipulate              
              them.
