Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program is part of the initiative to collect                     
              perishable data resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern                    
              California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                           
                                                                                             
              This is a collaborative project with Professor Jean-Lou                        
              Chameau at Purdue University.  The Earth Technology                            
              Corporation, Long Beach, California, is assisting in                           
              obtaining the field data: in addition Drs. Geoffrey Martin                     
              and Edward Kavazanjian of Earth Technology Corporation are                     
              providing technical assistance to the project.  Drs. Clough,                   
              Chameau, and Kavazanjian during the period 1979-1985                           
              investigated the soil response and soil failures expected in                   
              the Bay Area as a result of a large earthquake: however the                    
              effects observed as a result of the Loma Prieta earthquake                     
              appear to be more extensive than was expected, in part                         
              because the ground motions were more severe than anticipated                   
              from data existing ten years ago.  The project is utilizing                    
              these previous studies, focusing on the areas that suffered                    
              significant ground failures, such as the Marina District.                      
              At the same time it is using the improved understanding of                     
              ground failure mechanisms that has occurred since the                          
              original studies were undertaken.                                              
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this project are: to gather relevant                         
              geotechnical data obtained since 1980; to map ground                           
              features that are important to identify the extent of                          
              liquefaction and ground amplification effects; perform about                   
              30 cone penetration tests at locations where earlier tests                     
              had been conducted; organize the above information into a                      
              computerized data base; and make preliminary assessments of                    
              the correlation between field observations and data obtained                   
              before and after the 1989 earthquake.
