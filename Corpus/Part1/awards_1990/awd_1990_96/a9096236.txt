Abstract    :
                   Professor Bendersky intends to use the machinery of elliptic              
              genera to study geometric problems.  He plans to study the                     
              problem of vector fields on Spin manifolds from the point of view              
              of elliptic genera.  He also plans to continue his investigation               
              of the implications of the rigidity of elliptic genera on the                  
              Brown-Kervaire and Atiyah invariants of Spin manifolds with                    
              circle actions.                                                                
                   This project will also study the interaction of the unstable              
              Novikov spectral sequence and the unstable Adams spectral                      
              sequence.  Using recent work of Davis and Mahowald, he plans to                
              compute many of the James numbers.                                             
                   Both parts of this project involve highly intricate                       
              algebraic constructions which lend themselves, surprisingly, to                
              understanding the geometry of some very natural geometric                      
              objects, namely the Spin manifolds.//
