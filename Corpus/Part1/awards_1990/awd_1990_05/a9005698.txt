Abstract    :
                   This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   
              Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                
              of Mathematical Sciences of the National Sciences Foundation.                  
              This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                
              equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                          
              mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                 
              research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                    
              project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                
              coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                
              with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                 
              the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                         
              corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic              
              research in the mathematical sciences.                                         
                   This equipment will be used to support five research                      
              projects in the Department of Mathematics of Brandeis University:              
              Green's conjecture on the free resolution of canonical curves,                 
              the investigator is David Eisenbud; equivariant free resolutions               
              and equivariant Groebner bases, the investigators are David                    
              Buchsbaum and Eisenbud; development of "Macaulay", the                         
              investigator is Eisenbud; hypergeometric series identities and                 
              generalized symmetric functions, the investigator is Ira Gessel;               
              completely integrable systems, the investigators are Mark Adler                
              and Pierre Van Moerbeke.
