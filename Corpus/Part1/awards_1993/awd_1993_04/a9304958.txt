Abstract    :
              9304958  Swalla    The proposed experiments investigate the role of a novel 58
              kD  protein (p58) in ascidian larval tail muscle differentiation.   Ascidian
              embryos are used as a model system to study cell  autonomous differentiation
              because embryonic cells which inherit  the myoplasm, a localized region of the
              egg, will become larval  muscle cells in isolation.  The experiments to be
              performed will  test the hypothesis that p58 is involved in larval tail muscle 
              determination.  P58 is synthesized early in oogenesis, then is  concentrated in
              the egg myoplasm during vitellogenesis, and later  is abundant in larval tail
              muscle cells.  I have sequenced a clone  isolated by screening an expression
              library with NN18, an antibody  which recognizes p58 on western blots.  This
              clone encodes a novel  protein related to transducin, the Drosophila Enhancer
              of split   E(spl)  message m9/10, and human nuclear proteins.  E(spl) is a 
              member of the Notch group of genes, which have been shown by  mutational
              analysis to function in cell fate decisions through  interactions with Notch,
              an EGF-like transmembrane protein.  I  propose to use the ascidian embryo as a
              model system to study the  mode of action of these unique genes.  The PI will
              first examine  the temporal and spatial expression of the p58 gene during 
              embryogenesis by northern and in situ hybridization.  Possible  interaction(s)
              of p58 with egg cytoskeletal components will be  investigated by double
              immunofluorescent labelling followed by  confocal microscopy, and also by
              ultrastructural  immunolocalization.  The role of p58 during embryogenesis will
              be  examined by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments.  P58 
              function in the embryo will be inhibited by microinjecting  antibodies into the
              egg and documenting the effect on development  and larval tail muscle
              formation.  The effect of expressing the  gene in cells that do not normally
              express it will be analyzed by  microinjection of cDNA clones or purified
              protein into the embryo.   In most  ascidian species, the egg develops into a
              tadpole larva  with a distinct head and a tail containing bands of striated
              muscle  cells, but in anural (tailless) embryos, there are no muscle cells  in
              the "larval" stage.  Anural (tailless) ascidians lack both  localization of p58
              in their egg myoplasm and larval tail muscle  cells, so that expression of the
              p58 gene will be examined in  anural embryos to explore how the egg
              cytoskeletal may be organized  differently in these species.  These experiments
              will test the  possibility that p58 may have a role in autonomous muscle cell 
              determination in ascidians.  ***
