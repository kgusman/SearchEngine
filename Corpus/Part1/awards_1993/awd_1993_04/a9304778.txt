Abstract    :
                   This award will support the development of mineral standards              
              for the calibration of analyses for the light elements of hydrogen,            
              lithium, beryllium, boron, and fluorine in geological materials.               
              Accurate determination of the chemical content of geological                   
              materials is critical to understanding their origin and potential              
              uses. The light elements listed above have traditionally proven                
              difficult to analyze directly and accurately. With the development             
              of modern analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry,                     
              secondary ion mass spectrometry, particle-induced gamma-ray                    
              emission spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, ion                        
              chromatography, and the electron microprobe these elements can be              
              analyzed directly with the help of well-calibrated comparison                  
              standards. Selection of mineral standards, their analysis, and                 
              dissemination of the results will be handled by the Principal                  
              investigator and colleagues.
