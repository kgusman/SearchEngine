Abstract    :
              9301801  Dusenbery   The magnetotail of the Earth's magnetosphere, including the
              plasma  sheet and its boundary layers, plays a major role in energy storage 
              and its subsequent release, energizing particles during magnetic  substorms. 
              The current sheet is generally regarded as the primary  locus of tail
              energization.  We propose to carry out four research  projects in magnetotail
              physics: 1) particle motion in a nonzero y-  component of the tail magnetic
              field at the current sheet, 2)  trigger mechanisms of the current sheet
              catastroophe model, 3)  neutral line signatures and modeling, and 4) dynamics
              of the plasma  sheet boundary layer.  Project 1 involves tools from nonlinear 
              particle dynamics such as orbit analysis, Poincare surface-of-  section plots,
              and the underlying invariants. A 1D hybrid  simulation code will be used for
              Project 2 to investigate kinetic  instabilities as an internal trigger for the
              current sheet  catastrophe model.  A single-particle simulation model will be
              used  to model ion distributions near a neutral line for Project 3.  The  last
              project examines the equilibrium structure and nonlinear  evolution of a
              sheared, inhomogeneous plasma sheet boundary layer  using a Vlasov model
              exended to include multi-ion species.  A 2-  1/2D particle simulation model
              will also be used to study nonlinear  evolution of the boundary with high ion
              density gradients.  The  overall theme of the proposed research is to
              understand the role of  microscopic and mesoscale processes on the global
              dynamics of the  current sheet and the plasma sheet boundary layer regions of
              the  Earth's magnetotail.     ***
