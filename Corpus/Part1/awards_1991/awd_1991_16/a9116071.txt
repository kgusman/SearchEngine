Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This investigation introduces a new concept, fish growth                  
              rate potential, which is derived from the integration of                       
              spatially articulated field data on prey sizes, prey density                   
              and the physical environment with a species-specific                           
              physiological-based model of fish growth rate.  The approach                   
              combines the strengths of bioacoustics to measure fish density                 
              and size quantitatively and of bioenergetics models to                         
              accurately simulate fish growth.  The result is a two-                         
              dimensional, nonlinear biophysical model of fish growth and                    
              system production.  This research will develop the growth rate                 
              potential parameter mathematically and evaluate the                            
              sensitivity and spatial statistics of fish growth rate                         
              potential on a diel and seasonal basis assuming different                      
              ecological hypotheses on predator behavior (optimal foraging,                  
              thermoregulation, behavioral bioenergetics).  The Chesapeake                   
              Bay will be used as a study site because of the availability of                
              an extensive database well-suited for these analyses.  Since                   
              growth rate potential links biology and physics within a                       
              spatially-explicit framework, it has widespread application for                
              predicting how changes in the patterning or absolute scaling of                
              the environment might affect production dynamics of higher                     
              trophic levels.  It is anticipated that the concept of growth                  
              rate potential will evolve and provide a stimulus for the                      
              development of conceptual analogs.
