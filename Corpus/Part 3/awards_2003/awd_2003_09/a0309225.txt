In nature, networks of mycorrhizal fungi
              encompass and connect the roots of neighbor plants, often including multiple
              species over several square meters.  Greenhouse experiments show that carbon
              and nitrogen acquired by seedlings move directionally into neighbors via these
              common mycorrhizal networks (CMN) when neighbors are shaded or have low N
              concentration.  It has been hypothesized that CMN limit competition,
              particularly between overstory and recruiting tree populations, and have
              indirect effects on forest community structure.  This research will 1)
              demonstrate the importance of CMN for the growth and survival of three tree
              seedling species growing in a temperate forest, 2) evaluate the influence of
              CMN on the hierarchy of seedling species performance, 3) quantify mycorrhizal
              host-specificity and the frequency of interspecific CMN in the field, and 4)
              clarify the rules that govern the distribution of soil N to multiple hosts by
              CMN.  An additional study will demonstrate, for the first time, carbon flow
              between overstory trees and seedlings using13-C isotope analysis.  This study
              will aid in interpretation of CMN effects on seedling performance, and stand as
              a major contribution to our understanding of mycorrhizal functioning, plant
              competition, and succession in forest ecosystems.
