This
              award will provide funding to partially defray travel
expenses of U.S.-based
              mathematicians attending the conference
"Invariant Theory and its Interactions
              with Related Fields"
(Ingo2003), to be held in Goettingen, Germany, March
              23-29,
2003. Invariant theory, with roots in the 17th century, has
proven to
              be a robust area of mathematical endeavor.  Over the
course of the last 50
              years, it has found new applications in
algebraic topology, representation
              theory, algebraic geometry, as
well as many traditional areas such as number
              theory and
commutative algebra.  Professor Lesh is on the
              scientific
organizing committee for Ingo2003, which is an initiative
              of
research groups in Aberdeen, Manchester, and Goettingen working
in the
              areas of algebraic topology, representation theory, and
commutative algebra.
              These scientists have found that
communication across narrow specialty
              boundaries can bring great
scientific benefits. A central theme of the
              conference will be
the many connections of invariant theory to other fields.
              In the
past, conferences organized around the topic of invariant theory
have
              tended to be rather specialized, for example, concentrating
on computational
              aspects, or emphasizing interaction with at most
one other subject area, such
              as algebraic topology. Ingo2003 is
being organized with a much broader
              scientific base and will be
interdisciplinary in a global sense, as well as
              having a specific
focus on younger researchers. Some of the topics represented
              in
discussions will be modular representation theory, coinvariants
and the
              "hit problem," algebraic topology, and Hasse-Schmidt
differentials and
              differential Galois theory.

One aspect of invariant theory is studying the
              question of what
elements of a changing situation must in fact remain fixed.
              For
example, the points along the axis of a spinning globe remain in
the same
              position as the globe turns. The point at the center of
the spindle of a tape
              player stays fixed while other points on
the spindle turn around it. More
              surprisingly, rotating a circle
around its center and then flipping the circle
              over any line
through its center must leave a different line in a
              fixed
position.  The search for such "invariant" or "fixed" elements of
a
              situation can be very subtle, and it arises in a wide variety
of mathematical
              problems and physical applications. The goal of
the Ingo2003 conference is to
              allow mathematicians from differing
mathematical disciplines to learn
              techniques from each other, and
to disseminate sets of mathematical tools
              developed in one
discipline to other disciplines that might find them
              useful.
