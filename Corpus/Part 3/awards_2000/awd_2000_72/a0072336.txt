The principal investigator will search for new solutions to
              the
Newtonian N-body problem using a combination of the direct method
of the
              calculus of variations, a detailed knowledge of ``shape
space'', and a careful
              investigation of the action functional
near collisions of the bodies.  By the
              ``shape space'' we mean
the space of either similarity classes or congruence
              classes of
N-gons.  In recent joint work with Alain Chenciner,
              this
three-pronged approach proved its utility by yielding a hitherto
unknown
              orbit for the three-body problem.  In our new orbit all
three masses chase
              each other around the same figure eight shaped
curve in the plane. Our orbit
              turns out to be dynamically
(actually KAM) stable.  The chief technical
              difficulty to be
overcome in successfully applying the method is that of
              avoiding
collisions between the masses.  Unlike the action in problems
with
              strong-force potentials, the action with the Newtonian
potential admits
              finite-action solutions with collision.  One
knows very little about
              minimizers with collision. In particular
they need not be regularized in any
              of the various senses.  The
proposer will focus on the collisions.  If an
              action minimizing
sequence tends to a curve with collisions, under
              what
circumstance are those collisions Levi-Civita regularized?  Are
there
              blow-up techniques which will enable us to better
understand such sequences
              tending toward collision?  These are
some of the questions we will
              consider.

The three-body problem is the problem of understanding the
              long
term behaviour of three masses (planets, stars, satellites)
attracting
              each other according to Newton's laws of physics.  It
is one of the oldest
              problems in mathematics,dating back to
Newton.  About 100 years ago the French
              mathematician Poincare
made fundamental progress. He showed that chaos exists
              in the
three-body problem, in contrast to the the two-body problem,
where the
              motions are very regular (and well-approximated by that
of the earth around
              the sun).  He also pointed out the central
importance of periodic orbits to
              the problem. Periodic orbits are
motions of the masses which repeat the same
              pattern indefinitely
like a point going around a circle.  We propose to find
              new
periodic solutions to the three-body problem and the N-body (N is
four,
              five, six,...)  problem by using a combination of
methods. The methods
              themselves are not new, but their
combination is.  This approach has already
              proved successful in
one instance -- by yielding a new solution in which three
              equal
masses chase each around a figure eight curve, never catching
each
              other.  Our work could lead to further significant advances
in the
              understanding of the N-body problem. The techniques may
prove to be useful in
              other dynamical situations.  There is some
possibility that our orbits might
              be found to exist somewhere in
the universe, or used in space missions
              someday.
