This project lies in the area of geometric variational
              calculus,
treating the behavior of singularities and energy concentration
for
              various optimal or stationary functions, fields, or geometric
structures
              subject to geometric or analytic constraints. Specific
investigations focus on
              the relation between energy and
topological obstruction in mappings between
              manifolds,
ferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials, improper slicing
              of
polynomial varieties, compactness of currents in Carnot groups,
and the
              regularity of relaxed energy minimizers. We will
investigate the energy
              concentration along area-minimizing sets
for limits of singularities of
              p-energy minimizing maps as p
approaches a critical power.  In various higher
              dimensional
cases, energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings
              may
occur along sets of infinite measure and is related to
homotopically
              nontrivial mappings of spheres. Singularities in
ferromagnetic and liquid
              crystal materials will be also studied
in both stationary and dynamic
              contexts. The theories of improper
intersections of polynomial zero sets from
              algebraic geometry
will be investigated to understand related behavior in
              analysis
and partial differential equations. A theory of currents in
Carnot
              groups will be studied with an eye on applications to
variational
              problems.

Underlying many physical phenomena is a least-energy
              principle
whereby certain configurations or fields or geometric shapes
              are
distinguished by their property of having less energy or area
than
              competing objects. The external constraints often lead to
singularities, which
              are special points characterized by rapid
changes of structure occurring in
              very small spatial regions. For
example, one observes dislocation faults in
              solids under stress,
domain walls in magnetized materials, vortices in
              superconducting
materials, liquid edges and corners in soap films, and
              point,
curve, and surface defects in various liquid crystal
materials. We
              deal with new mathematical structures and theories
necessary to explain and
              predict such phenomena.  In these
problems, the theoretical studies of pure
              mathematics, the
numerical computational studies of applied mathematics, and
              the
phenomenological studies from physics all benefit each other and
all have
              a crucial scientific role.
