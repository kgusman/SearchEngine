Abstract
The investigators propose to explore
              3-dimensional topology via
contact structures, based on new techniques in the
              classification
of tight contact structures on various 3-dimensional manifolds.
               Our
main goal is to develop the 3-dimensional cut-and-paste
              techniques
involving convex surfaces and ``bypasses" into a
              largely
combinatorial one. The investigators propose to import ideas
              and
constructions from the theory of foliations and laminations (in
joint
              work with J. Etnyre and W. Kazez). Convex surfaces and
bypasses aid the
              decomposition of a tight contact manifold
(eventually) into balls, similar to
              the `` sutured manifold
decomposition", due to Gabai.  The ``dividing curves
              on the
surfaces along which the cuttings take place determine the
              tight
contact structure.  A project which is currently under way is
              to
carefully follow the sutured manifold decompositions of Gabai
              in
constructing taut foliations on most 3-manifolds, and to construct
tight
              contact structures by gluing in much the same way as Gabai's
construction.  We
              hope to produce an effective gluing theorem for
tight contact structures. 
              Another direction of research is
Legendrian knot theory. Using the
              classification of tight contact
structures on solid tori, Etnyre and Honda
              propose to classify
Legendrian torus knots and Legendrian figure eight knots.
              

The investigators propose a study of 3-dimensional spaces. 
              The
3-dimensional spaces we study will locally be similar to the
standard
              Euclidean 3-dimensional space.  These objects may be very
complicated
              globally, but a local observer cannot tell the
difference, just as an ant
              cannot tell whether it is sitting on a
flat plane or a very large sphere. 
              `Finite' 2-dimensional spaces
have been classified and understood for a long
              time - they are the
2-dimensional sphere, the doughnut, the doughnut with 2
              holes, the doughnut
with 3 holes, etc., and are distinguished by the number of
              holes. 
However, in spite of work by numerous mathematicians this century,
a
              complete classification of 3-dimensional spaces is far from
understood.  In
              our work we seek to better understand 3-dimensional
spaces by imposing an
              additional structure, called a contact
structure, which, very loosely
              speaking, amounts to choosing a
preferred direction (or a spinning axis) at
              every point in the
3-dimensional space.  Contact structures have intimate
              connections
with 4-dimensional geometry, quantum physics, and dynamics (such
              as
fluid dynamics), and we hope to gain better understanding of
3-dimensional
              spaces through contact structures.
