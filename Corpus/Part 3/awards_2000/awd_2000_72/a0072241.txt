The PI's research deals with questions in affine geometry
              and
geometric probability of convex bodies as well as with
applications.  A
              tool of considerable importance in the area of
isoperimetric inequalities is
              the affine surface area from affine
differential geometry whose classical
              definition goes back to
Blaschke and involves the curvature function of a
              smooth convex
body. An important problem in convex geometry was to extend
              the
notion of affine surface area to all convex bodies. The solution
of this
              problem has only been completed within the last
decade. At present, many
              extensions of the affine surface area
exist, several of them discovered by the
              PI. The new techniques
and ideas developed in the process of these extensions
              should be
beneficial for other problems, and the PI proposes to apply
              these
techniques to problems of approximation of convex bodies by
polytopes.
              These approximation problems have been studied
extensively and find
              application in many areas of mathematics and
computer science. In one paper,
              for instance, the PI and her
collaborator proved the surprising result that
              random
approximation by polytopes (choosing the vertices of the
approximating
              polytope randomly on the boundary of the body) is
as good as best
              approximation.  The Gaussian correlation
conjecture in probability and
              statistics asserts that
origin-symmetric convex sets are positively correlated
              under the
standard Gaussian measure.  In spite of several partial
              results
obtained by many researchers within the last years, including the
PI,
              the conjecture remains undecided.  Optimal estimates for the
tail of the
              Gaussian distribution obtained in this context by the
PI and her collaborators
              are also relevant for problems in
mathematical physics (see e.g.Differential
              Equations and
Mathematical Physics, International Press 2000, p.43-51).

The
              PI wants to get an understanding of the structure of convex
sets.  To do so
              she uses techniques from different areas of
mathematics: analysis,
              differential geometry, convexity
theory. One wants to understand the structure
              of such sets as
they appear naturally not only in other branches of
              mathematics
and mathematical physics, but also in applied areas,
              like
tomography and image analysis, and computer sciences.  The PI and
her
              collaborators plan to continue working on problems where
convexity and other
              areas of more applied mathematics
interact. Currently she is involved in a
              project related to
quantum computing which uses -among other things- tools
              from
convexity theory.
