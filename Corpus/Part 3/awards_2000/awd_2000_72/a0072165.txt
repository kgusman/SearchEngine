The study of Lorentz manifolds may be
              motivated by physical
considerations, since the Einstein field equations
              determine Lorentz
metrics on space-time. Following F.~Klein's Erlanger
              program, one
method of approaching a geometric object is to study its group
              of
isometries, and it has long been known that the isometry group of
              a
Lorentz manifold is a Lie group. Moreover, any Lie group acts on
itself (by
              left translation) preserving any left-invariant Lorentz
metric.  However, as
              originally noticed by R.~Zimmer, M.~Gromov, and
N.~Kowalsky, if one requires
              even a small amount of complication to
the dynamics, then the list of Lie
              groups admitting a Lorentz action
becomes quite restricted.  My work over the
              last few years has focused
on quantifying exactly which connected Lie groups
              admit a complicated
action by isometries of a connected Lorentz manifold. As
              the
definition of ``complicated'' varies, the answer varies, and I intend
to
              look at a few more of these variations over the coming years. In
particular, I
              would like to determine the collection of connected,
noncompact, simple Lie
              groups admitting a locally faithful, nontame,
isometric action on a connected
              Lorentz manifold. I believe it should
be true that any such group either has
              infinite center or is locally
isomorphic to the Lie group of 2 by 2 real
              unimodular matrices.

A Lorentz manifold, or ``space-time'' is one of the
              basic object of
general relativity. Some of these objects have many
              symmetries, while
most have none at all. Fix a space-time having a large
              collection of
symmetries. For any point in this space-time, if we move it
              around by
all the symmetries under consideration, the collection of image
              points
so obtained is called the ``orbit'' of the point.  A number
              of
researchers have noticed that it is difficult to construct a
space-time
              with chaotic orbits, by which we mean, broadly speaking,
that some orbits
              repeatedly return (or nearly return) to the
same place. There are, in fact,
              many ways to define precisely the word
chaotic, and this means that a number
              of different theorems have been
obtained. I intend to continue developing
              results along these lines.
