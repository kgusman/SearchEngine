              proposes research directed towards a unified understanding
of mirror symmetry.
               Current ideas -- including ``classical''
mirror symmetry; Kontsevich's
              conjecture; the work of Vafa; and
the conjecture of Strominger, Yau, and
              Zaslow -- are only loosely
connected and involve both perturbative and
              non-perturbative
string reasoning.  An understanding of how
              non-perturbative
string theory relates to the classical mirror symmetry
              picture
and Gromov-Witten invariants will be an important step
              towards
unification.  Five projects are proposed towards achieving this
goal:
              1) Developing a mathematical formulation of the new
invariants obtained by
              Gopakumar and Vafa from BPS state
counting.  2) Understanding the
              multiple-cover formulas which
yield integers from higher-genus Gromov-Witten
              invariants.  3)
Resolving the holomorphic ambiguity by determining it from
              the
structure of singularities of Calabi-Yau moduli space.  4)
Developing a
              physical understanding of Kontsevich's enlargement
of Calabi-Yau moduli space
              to include A-infinity structures.  5)
Defining a geometric Fourier-Mukai-like
              functor relating
special-Lagrangian cycles of one manifold to
              Hermitian-Yang-Mills
connections on bundles over the mirror.  This functor
              could lead
to a geometric proof of Kontsevich's formulation of
              mirror
symmetry.  All these projects aim to unify our still
              disparate
approaches to mirror symmetry.

This project is directed towards
              unifying our mathematical and
physical understanding of the phenomenon of
              mirror symmetry,
discovered by theoretical physicists working in string
              theory.
String theory is a proposed physical theory with the promise
              of
incorporating Einstein's understanding of space and gravity into
the
              quantum theory.  Mirror symmetry is a duality symmetry in
string theory,
              whereby two very different physical theories are
actually equivalent.  When
              one of the theories is easily
computable and the other hard, this leads to
              predictions of
answers to difficult calculations.  From the mathematical
              point
of view, this can lead to conjectures relating parallel
structures --
              the structures involved in describing the
different, but equivalent,
              mathematical models of physical
theories.  The relationships unearthed by
              mirror symmetry are
deep and novel.  A unified understanding of them may join
              not
only fields of research but different disciplines -- math and
physics --
              as well.  This award is partially funded by the
program in Mathematical
              Physics of the Division of Physics.
