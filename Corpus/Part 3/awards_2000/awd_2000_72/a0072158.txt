This
              project addresses problems in three closely related areas in
the context of
              mirror symmetry and duality. As a continuation of
current joint work with K.
              Liu and S.T. Yau, Lian proposes to
both generalize and specialize their theory
              ("mirror principle")
for studying characteristic classes of vector bundles on
              a stable
map moduli space. First, this work has thus far considered
              convex
projective manifolds.  Dropping the convexity assumption is
important
              if one wishes to consider general Calabi-Yau
manifolds. Part I of this
              proposal outlines an approach which is
expected to lead to the full
              generalization of mirror principle
in in genus zero. The main new input here
              is a way to combine the
difficult machinery of virtual cycles and the many
              ingredients of
the mirror principle. Second, the mirror principle can
              be
specialized to surfaces and many new questions which have
recently arisen
              in local mirror symmetry, as well as enumerative
geometry on surfaces.  In the
              former case partition functions of
a given genus are related to modular forms
              whenever the
underlying surface is elliptic. In the latter case,
              enumerating
curves of a given genus with suitable incidence in a surface
              also
yields modular forms. This project seeks to understand modularity
from
              the point of view of characteristic classes of vector
bundles on stable map
              moduli spaces. For positive genus, the
mirror principle requires yet another
              generalization.  In Part II
of this project, Hosono, Lian, Liu and Yau will
              examine these new
questions. In recent joint work of Hosono, Lian and Yau,
              they
have settled the problem of constructing the ubiquitous large
radius
              limit for the "universal" family of Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces in a toric
              manifold. In Part III Lian, Todorov and
Yau will study this limit for more
              general families.

String physics is an ambitious effort to unify all
              the
fundamental forces of nature. A remarkable prediction of String
Theory is
              that nature apparently allows for many different
versions of spacetimes.  A
              major current problem in string
physics is to understand how a plethora of
              apparently different
spacetimes are related, often in an unexpected and
              remarkable
ways, under the rubric of ``String Duality''. Mirror symmetry is
a
              special yet nontrivial case of String Duality. Though they come
in vast
              variety, the spacetimes in questions are still highly
restricted.  They turn
              out to be a class of geometrical objects,
known as Calabi-Yau manifolds, which
              have been studied by
mathematicians for over 100 years.  Physicists have
              discovered
that string theories associated to certain pairs of
              Calabi-Yau
manifolds ("mirror pairs") are equivalent.  This project aims
              at
understanding the geometry of these mirror manifolds from the
mathematical
              point of view.  A constant exchange of insights and
feedback between
              physicists and mathematicians on mirror symmetry
and other issues has been a
              hallmark of String Theory in its last
20 years of development.
