	The investigator proposes a number of inter-related projects
              to study spatial random systems which are of interest both in probability
              theory and statistical physics.  The projects are concerned with regular,
              invasion and FK percolation, Ising-Potts models and network flows. In
              percolation and invasion percolation certain structural properties of large
              clusters will be studied at or near the critical point in two or higher
              dimensions.  In a further project the relation between characteristic length
              and renormalization will be investigated. A project focuses on phase
              coexistence in Ising-Potts models and it is concerned with the microscopic
              properties of the Wulff droplet and of other interfaces, and with the analysis
              of phase coexistence in the presence of several phases. Decay of correlations
              and the relaxation of boundary effects in FK percolation (and indirectly in
              Potts models) is the target of two further projects.  The study of capacitated
              networks is proposed by using sophisticated large deviation methods which have
              proven to be decisive in other context.

	The aim of this project is to gain
              insight and achieve understanding of certain fundamental systems having their
              origin in statistical and condensed matter physics, materials science,
              chemistry and earth sciences.  Success in solving some of the proposed problems
              would lead to some of the following benefits: 1) the derivation of rigorous
              knowledge about fundamental physical systems of theoretical and practical
              relevance, 2) a deeper insight into the mechanisms responsible for the behavior
              of such systems, 3) the development of new mathematical methods and tools
              which, apart from yielding answers to questions raised in other fields, might
              benefit and enrich probability theory itself.
