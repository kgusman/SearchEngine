Inverse spectral geometry is the study of the extent to which
              the
geometry of a surface or, more generally, of a Riemannian
manifold can be
              extracted from spectral data.  The primary
spectral data associated to a
              compact Riemannian manifold are the
eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami
              operator.  The investigators
propose to apply recently developed methods to
              study the extent
to which the eigenvalue spectrum determines the local
              geometry of
a compact Riemannian manifold.  They will also ask the extent
              to
which additional spectral data such as the spectrum of the
Laplacian
              acting on differential forms of various degrees
determines the geometry of the
              manifold.  Inverse spectral
problems will be considered on Riemannian
              orbifolds as well as on
manifolds; orbifolds are the most tractable singular
              spaces.  For
the Schrodinger operator "Laplacian plus potential", the
              problem
of recovering the potential from spectral data will be studied in
the
              case of line bundles over tori.  In analogy to the case of
planar domains, the
              lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a
compact Riemannian manifold may be
              viewed as the fundamental
tone.  The question of whether random Riemann
              surfaces have large
first eigenvalue will be studied using connections
              between
spectra of Riemann surfaces and spectra of graphs.  For
noncompact
              Riemannian manifolds, the primary spectral data are
the scattering poles; the
              investigators expect to exhibit
continuous families of isopolar metrics.

In
              spectroscopy, one attempts to recover the chemical composition
or the shape of
              an object from the characteristic frequencies of
light or sound emitted.  In
              the case of a vibrating membrane such
as a drumhead, viewed mathematically as
              a bounded region in the
plane, the spectrum of characteristic frequencies
              corresponds to
the mathematical notion of the Laplace spectrum.  The
              Laplace
spectrum is also defined for other geometric objects called
manifolds
              which arise in mathematics and physics.  The
investigators, along with Scott
              Wolpert, earlier constructed the
first examples of differently shaped
              drumheads (planar regions)
with the same spectrum.  Planar regions can differ
              in their
global shape but locally are identical; i.e., if you look at a
small
              piece cut out from one of the regions, you can not tell
which region it came
              from.  Recently, the principal investigator
developed methods for constructing
              geometric objects with the
same Laplace spectrum but which differ in their
              local as well as
global shape.  These methods will be used to investigate
              which
local geometric properties of manifolds are not spectrally
determined. 
              Additional spectral problems will also be considered
such as the construction
              of surfaces of arbitrarily large volume
but having bounded fundamental tone.
