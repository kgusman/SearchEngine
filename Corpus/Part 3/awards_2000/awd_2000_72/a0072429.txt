Abstract::
Over the years a nice
              conjectural picture has emerged of the
structure of closed 3-manifolds. It has
              been shaped by the
geometrization and virtual bundle conjectures of
              Thurston
and the compactification conjectures of Simon and of Marden.
These
              imply certain consequences for covering spaces of such
3-manifolds. Closed,
              orientable, irreducible 3-manifolds with
infinite fundamental group ought to
              have universal covering
space homeomorphic to Euclidean 3-space. Professor
              Myers will
continue his work on this problem by ruling out classes
              of
possible counterexamples through an analysis of group actions
on Whitehead
              manifolds; he will use a new result which promises
to extend his work on
              Whitehead manifolds which contain
non-trivial planes to those which do not.
              More generally,
covering spaces with finitely generated fundamental group
              ought
to be homeomorphic to interiors of compact 3-manifolds. He
              will
continue his work on this problem and on the closely related
problem of
              showing that the same conclusion holds for hyperbolic
3-manifolds with
              finitely generated fundamental group. Freedman
has reduced the latter problem
              to a purely topological problem
which seems accessible. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds
              of finite volume
ought to be finitely covered by surface bundles over the
              circle,
although very few non-trivial examples of this phenomenon are
              known.
Myers will attempt to construct more such examples and will
              explore
the extent to which the desired conclusion is implied by the
              failure
of the finitely generated intersection property in the
              fundamental
group. 3-manifolds with cubings of negative curvature ought to
be
              hyperbolic; Myers will investigate a method for trying to build
hyperbolic
              structures, trying to determine both its scope and
limitations. Finally, he
              will attempt to construct small knots in
non-Haken 3-manifolds.

Manifolds
              are spaces which generalize the familiar curves and
surfaces that live in
              ordinary 3-dimensional space. An n-manifold
locally looks like n-dimensional
              space; thus a curve is a 1-manifold,
and a surface is a 2-manifold.
              3-manifolds are difficult to
visualize but can be described mathematically.
              Such spaces arise
as models of the universe in general relativity; in this
              role
they come equipped with geometries, i.e. ways of measuring
              distances,
angles, and curvature. Conjectures of Thurston, Simon, and
              Marden
suggest that the members of a large class of 3-manifolds
              have
particularly nice geometries and can be constructed from the
members of
              a small set of standard 3-manifolds by identifying
their points in certain
              ways. Professor Myers will attempt to
verify various important special cases
              of this conjectural picture.
