My
              project will focus on the understanding of the geometry and
topology of mirror
              symmetry, in particular the aspect of counting
curves in projective manifolds.
              More precisely there are three
outstanding and closely related problems that I
              would like to
work on and hope to solve. The first is to prove the most
              general
mirror principle for counting rational curves in any
              projective
manifold and its Calabi-Yau submanifolds; the second is
              to
understand the geometry and algebra of the local mirror symmetry,
in
              particular, of the surprising role played by the elliptic
curves appeared in
              our computation by applying mirror principle;
the third is to develop a mirror
              principle for counting curves of
higher genus in projective manifolds. I hope
              to solve these
problems by further extending the techniques we developed
              to
prove the mirror principle for balloon manifolds. These three
problems are
              the different aspects of a single problem: to prove
and understand the mirror
              principle in its most general form.

Superstring theory, one of the most
              ambitious theory in sciences,
is proposed for the grand unification of the
              laws of the nature.
Based on this theory, string theorists have made many
              remarkable
mathematical conjectures. Mirror symmetry is among one of
              them.
The proofs of these conjectures will not only give
              beautiful
mathematical results, but also help gain confidence in the
physical
              theory. The mirror principle we developed has partially
verified some of these
              conjectures. It has many interesting
mathematical consequences and is
              remarkably compatible with the
physical theory.
