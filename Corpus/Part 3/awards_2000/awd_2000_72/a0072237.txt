Professor Barrett will investigate various topics in
              complex
analysis.  One topic to be studied is the behavior of two
different
              systems of partial differential equations implementing
deformation of a real
              hypersurface in two-dimensional complex
euclidean space by the Levi-form of
              the hypersurface.  The
systems are analogous, respectively, to
              harmonic-mapping heat
flow and to the Ricci-flow on the space of conformal
              metrics, but
these particular systems have special features (the role
              of
Lorentzian geometry in the target space and the inclusion of
lower-order
              terms which are not conjugation invariant in the
source space) that introduce
              new phenomena and difficulties.  The
associated steady-state system has known
              applications to function
theory and engineering, and the study of the
              time-dependent
versions given above may lead to new insights into
              analytic
continuation.  A second topic to be studied is the boundary
behavior
              of the Bergman kernel function (off the diagonal) and
Bergman representative
              coordinates on domains with corners, with
particular interest in the case of
              generic intersections of
strictly pseudoconvex domains (the case of
              intersecting balls
serving as a key model problem).

Professor Barrett will
              investigate various problems involving
multiple parameters (the parameters are
              understood to lie in the
so-called complex number system, a widely-used
              extension of the
standard number system).  One topic involves the study of
              systems
of partial differential equations which serve to flatten a
surface in
              the parameter space; sometimes the equations push the
surface to an
              equilibrium configuration (the situation is
somewhat analogous to that of a
              soap film attached to a fixed
wire boundary), but sometimes the surface breaks
              before reaching
equilibrium (for example, this will happen if there is
              no
available equilibrium configuration).  The computation of
equilibrium
              configurations for these problems (or the
documentation that no equilibrium
              exists) is important in
classical function theory, and is also a central topic
              in the
engineering discipline known as "H-infinity control theory."  A
second
              topic to be studied is based on Stefan Bergman's method of
finding a sort of
              "ideal form" for a region in complex
multiparameter space.  In the
              one-parameter setting Bergman's
method tells us how to perform the useful task
              of smoothing out
corners appearing in the boundary of the region (such
              smoothing
is of fundamental importance for example in
              classical
aerodynamics); the proposed research will examine what happens
              to
corners in the multi-parameter setting.
