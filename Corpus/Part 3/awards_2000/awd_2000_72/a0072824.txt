Abstract    :
              The Polar Research Board (PRB), a unit of the National Research Council, was
              established in 1958 to advise the government on polar issues.  The PRB strives
              to make research in the polar regions more productive and responsive to the
              needs of the United States, to maintain U.S. awareness of, and representation
              in, international science programs, and to enhance understanding of issues in
              polar regions.  The Board provides national and international scientific and
              technical information to U.S. government policy makers and the polar community,
              represents U.S. interests in international nongovernmental polar scientific
              organizations and conducts focused studies in areas of polar science,
              technology and resource management.  The PRB facilitates participation of U.S.
              scientists in two critical international committees dedicated to planning and
              coordination research in the Arctic and Antarctic  [i.e., the International
              Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
              Research (SCAR)].  PRB activities are conducted by a group of volunteer
              experts, supported by a small staff, selected from academic institutions,
              industry and national laboratories.  The PRB will continue to serve as an
              information center for distributing materials on IASC and SCAR to U.S.
              government agencies and the polar community.  Other federal agencies and
              foundations also provide support to the PRB.
