              NEW STATISTICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY MULTISCALE AND ADAPTIVE
REPRESENTATIONS

Project period: 07/01/00 --
              06/30/05

The project will address the following specific topics:
1.
              Estimation in tomography: the curvelet tight frame of
representation seems,
              according to preliminary calculations, to
achieve faster rates of convergence
              than traditional tomographic
methods.
2. Estimation and testing in
              time-frequency analysis: a new tight
frame of chirplets has been built by
              deploying curvelets in the
time-frequency plane.  The new representation has
              promise for detection and
estimation of chirps in the presence of noise.
3.
              Recent work in computational vision asks ``what is the best basis
for
              representing natural images?''  It is proposed that many empirical
results in
              the rapidly growing literature on this topic might be
explained and improved
              using analytically-constructed representations:
ridgelets and curvelets.
4.
              Geometry-driven diffusions are popular in applied image processing
-- but
              their quantitative performance is not well-understood. It is
proposed to
              develop a quantitative statistical theory using recent
tools such as
              multiscale ridgelets.
5. Extensions of Sparsity-Based ideas. Problems of
              finding `edgels in
white noise' and `subspaces in white noise' offer
              challenging and
timely directions in which to generalize existing sparsity
              ideas.
6. Testing Sparse Means.  An adaptive approach is suggested
              for
testing if the mean of a random vector is nonzero, when the vector
might
              exhibit an unknown degree of sparsity.
7. Asymptotics of top eigenvalues of
              large covariance matrices.
A program is set out to develop statistical theory
              for principal
components of large data matrices based on recent progress
              in
random matrix theory.
Consistent with the principle of ``reproducible
              research'', software
and figures from this project will be made available in
              future
releases of the public domain WaveLab system.


In recent years,
              research in wavelets and time-frequency methods has
broadened to construct new
              systems of representation, including
systems custom-tailored for specific
              phenomena.  Examples include
wavelet packets and cosine packets, and very
              recently, systems like
edgelets, ridgelets, chirplets, warplets, and
              curvelets.  In parallel,
research in statistical analysis and cognate fields
              allows data
themselves to dictate the design of their own optimal systems
              of
representation.  Principal components (i.e.  Karhunen-Loeve
decomposition)
              is the oldest example of such data-adaptive
representation; many newer ideas
              have been proposed recently, such as
independent components analysis.  The
              proposers have been
active in both domains, creating new image and
              signal
representations and developing statistical theory to underpin
              adaptive
signal representations.  The current project will (a) pursue
              two
opportunities arising from the recent introduction of curvelets,
              (b)
address two active applied research areas, computational vision
              and
geometry driven diffusions, and (c) attack some issues which are
argued
              to be at the core of new developments in statistical decision
theory. Topic
              (a) may have implications for applied work in
tomography, image and signal
              processing, and (c) may impact applied
uses of principal components in domains
              such as climate and global
change studies.
