Abstract    :
              9709438  Peck    This Proposal requests a three year award to do
              high-resolution, interdisciplinary studies of Late Quaternary paleoclimate
              change as recorded in lacustrine sediment from Lakes Telmen and Dood Mongolia. 
              During the first two years, a lake coring and catchment sediment and soil
              sampling program will take place during the summer, when access to these lakes
              is possible.  The proposed paleoclimate study is system-wide in scope,
              interdisciplinary in approach and located in a region of the Earth that is
              little studied but important to global climate (Webb et al., 1993).  This
              project closely follows the guidelines of the USGCRP and PAGES programs and
              will contribute to greater coverage of the PEP-II Asian transect of PAGES/IGBP
              (Eddy, 1992).  This study will also aid the ongoing Baikal Drilling Project
              efforts to recover paleoclimate change from Baikal sediments (Williams et al.,
              1997) by providing higher resolution records from the same region.  Because
              small Mongolian lakes have accumulation rates approximately 5 times that of
              Lake Baikal (Sevastyanov et al., 1989; Colman et al., 1996), it will be
              possible to obtain a climate record with centennial to decadal resolution from
              the proposed Mongolian lake sites    Through coordinated analysis of multiple
              climate proxies, including rock-magnetics, palynology, geochemistry, diatoms,
              biogenic silica and detailed lithostratigraphy, this study will provide insight
              into orbital and internal forcing mechanisms of the Asian Monsoon, abrupt
              climate change (e.g., Younger Dryas, Little Ice Age), and ecosystem change in
              Mongolia and provide a means of testing climate models (e.g., COHMAP). 
              Quantification of humid and arid intervals in the sediment record will further
              understanding of the evolution/intensification of the Asian monsoon since the
              last glacial maximum and of variations in the transport of Atlantic air masses
              (Gasse et al., 1991; Kutzbach et al., 1993; Gasse and Van Campo, 1994; Weijian
              et al., 1996; Karabanov et al., submitted).  Regi onal studies of Late
              Quaternary climate change are often truncated at the Mongolian border
              (Velichko, 1984; Winkler and Wang, 1993; Peterson et al., 1993) because
              political borders provide convenient boundaries for regional syntheses and
              paleoclimate data from Mongolia is limited (see Fig. 1 in COHMAP members, 1988;
              Harrison et al., 1996).  However, the climate in the Mongolian region
              represents an important transition from the subarctic in the north (Russia) to
              desert in the south (Gobi of Mongolia/China).  The results of the proposed
              study will help link the better studied region to the south (Winkler and Wang,
              1993) to the existing network of lake paleoclimate records in Russia (Velichko,
              1984; Harrison et al., 1996) and the new paleoclimate studies from Lake Baikal
              (Williams et al., 1997) along the PEP-II transect.    A secondary but important
              objective of the proposed work is to provide geomagnetic records of direction
              and relative intensity (Thompson 1984; King et al., 1983; Tauxe, 1993).  These
              geomagnetic records will fill an important gap in the global distribution of
              such records, contribute to a better understanding of the nature of the
              geodynamo, and in conjunction with the Lake Baikal geomagnetic record (Peck et
              al., 1996), begin to form a regional master geomagnetic curve that can be used
              for correlation and dating in future studies of lake and loess sediments in
              central Asia
