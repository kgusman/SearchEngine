              Title: Using Midazolam to Explore Implicit Memory

Experimental and
              neuropsychological studies have demonstrated that subjects often display a form
              of memory in which they are affected by prior experiences, even though they
              have no conscious memory of these experiences. This form of memory is often
              referred to as implicit memory. Unfortunately, attempts to understand the
              nature of implicit memory have been stymied by methodological problems. These
              problems include:  1) difficulties in studying implicit memory in
              memory-impaired patients because of interpretive problems posed by the numerous
              correlated conditions afflicting memory-impaired patients (e.g., a history of
              alcohol abuse); and 2) difficulties in studying implicit memory in normal
              participants because of interpretive problems posed when conscious memory
              contaminates performance on implicit memory tests.  The current project uses
              midazolam, a safe, short-acting amnesiac agent to study implicit memory.
              Midazolam renders participants amnesiac for a brief period (e.g., 5minutes), 
              allowing us to explore the nature of implicit memory independently of
              contamination by conscious memory in normal participants.  The proposed
              experiments use this technique to explore the capacity of implicit memory to
              represent meaningful information.  Understanding how implicit memory represents
              meaningful  information will help us understand the similarities and
              differences between the operating principles that govern conscious and implicit
              memory, as well as enrich our understanding of the factors that facilitate
              meaningful processing of information.
