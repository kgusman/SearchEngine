              ABSTRACT:

The specific work described in this proposal consists of
              three
projects. Part I is a joint project with Juha Heinonen: A
celebrated
              result by Hayman and Wu says that the level sets of any
Riemann mapping can
              not be arbitrarily long. The PI and Heinonen
are analyzing the exact
              conditions under which this result extends
to the more general case of
              covering maps from the unit disk onto
multiply connected domains. To this end,
              we explore the uniform
thickness of boundaries of domains in the complex
              plane, a
condition that is measurably stronger than uniform perfectness.
Part
              II is a project that consists of generalizing Jorgensen's
inequality to
              discrete quasiconformal groups acting on the
n-dimensional unit sphere. Such a
              generalized Jorgensen inequality
would make it possible to extend fundamental
              aspects of the rich
theory known in the Kleinian case to the setting of
              quasiconformal
groups. A natural question (with Gaven Martin) for example
              is:
Under what assumptions is a discrete quasiconformal group
isomorphic to a
              Kleinian group? In part III, the PI is working on
questions concerning the
              dynamical action of a discrete
quasiconformal group acting on the
              n-dimensional unit ball. A
portion of this project is joint with Edward
              Taylor. We are
exploring local properties of the Hausdorff dimension of
              limit
sets of discrete quasiconformal groups. One of our questions is,
for
              example, to find the relation between the local Hausdorff
dimension of the
              limit set and the local Poincare exponent of the
group. Another question
              involves limit sets of infinite index
subgroups of discrete groups.


The
              theory of discrete groups of Mobius transformations is
especially beautiful as
              it intertwines geometry, analysis, and
topology. This proposal is part of an
              ongoing program to study the
interaction of geometry and analysis in the
              setting of discrete
quasiconformal groups and more generally, in geometric
              function
theory. The study of Kleinian groups (discrete groups of
              Mobius
transformations) goes back to the 18th century, when it was
developed
              by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein, and
Poincare. One of our
              goals is to analyze the thickness of the set
of chaotic behavior of a Kleinian
              group (and more general sets)
and to investigate under what assumptions such
              sets are uniformly
thick. Another goal is to explore how certain analytically
              and
geometrically defined properties change as one enlarges the class
of
              Kleinian groups. The enlarged class of groups that we are
mainly interested in
              is the class of discrete quasiconformal
groups. One objective is to analyze
              how one can quantify the
concept of discreteness in the class of
              quasiconformal groups.
Another goal is to relate the conformal action of a
              quasiconformal
group on the boundary of hyperbolic space to its action
              on
hyperbolic space. Much of our work is inspired by analogous
conjectures
              and developments in the field of hyperbolic geometry.
