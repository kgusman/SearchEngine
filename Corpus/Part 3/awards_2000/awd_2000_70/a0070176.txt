Abstract    :
              DMS-0070176-Lynne Billard

The International Biometrics Conference is planned
              for July 2-7, 2000, at
San Francisco.  The meeting will focus on the active
              areas of research in
biostatistics.  Areas of emphasis are "advancement of
              biological science
through the development of quantitative theories and the
              application,
development, and dissemination of effective mathematical and
              statistical
techniques".  The conference participants are concerned
              with
cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary interface of the theoretical
              and
application oriented real-world problems.  In addition to the invited
              talks,
ample time will be given for small group discussions in which
              junior
participants will meet with senior mentors and other
              participants.

The NSF monies requested are to support about fifteen
              U.S.-based participants
and five non-U.S.-based researchers with emphasis on
              young researchers
and traditionally underrepresented groups.   Support will be
              limited to
individuals at academic institutions and non-profit organizations.
