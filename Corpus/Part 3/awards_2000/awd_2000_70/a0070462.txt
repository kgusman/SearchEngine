" Reflection Principle in

The proposal
              is focused on the following problems of analytic continuation:
(i)
              Continuation of proper holomorphic mappings between domains with
     real
              analytic boundaries;
(ii) Analyticity of continuous CR mappings between real
              analytic manifolds;
(iii) Propagation of holomorphic and CR mappings along
              manifolds.
The existence of biholomorphic and/or proper holomorphic mappings
              between
certain domains ( or CR mappings between manifolds)
              imposes
significant restrictions on these domains ( manifolds ) as well as on
              the
mappings. These restrictions give rise to various, sometimes
              unexpected,
phenomena of analytic continuation in several complex variables.
              The goal of
the proposed research is to solve some concrete old problems and
              to provide
a further progress in the study of  analytic continuation and 
              related
areas.  The main method of investigation is the reflection principle,
              which
will be combined with other methods from analysis, geometry, algebra
              and
differential equations.

Complex analysis has been used as a powerful
              tool in mathematics and its
applications for a long time and has a tendency to
              a larger role in certain
areas. For example, the famous "edge of the wedge"
              theorem, which is now one
of the main ingredients of the reflection principle,
              was discovered by  a
physicist  N. Bogolyubov with respect to his research in
              quantum field
theory. Another important object in theoretical physics - the
              Heisenberg
group -
is closely connected with the group of holomorphic
              automorphisms of the
unit ball in the 2-dimensional complex space.
I believe
              that this research program will be useful not only for complex
analysis but
              also for the strengthening its ties with other areas of
mathematics and
              sciences by means of potential applications. It will also
influence
              mathematical education at Indiana University via involvement of
graduate
              students.
