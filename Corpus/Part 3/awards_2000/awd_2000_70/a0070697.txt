              ABSTRACT

A basic problem in several complex variables is to understand
the
              interplay between the analytic and geometric natures of a domain.
The
              principal investigator plans to address this problem by 
studying the
              d-bar-Neumann problem, invariant metrics, and 
automorphism groups. More
              specifically, the principal investigator plans
to  study compactness and
              eigenvalue spectrum of the d-bar-Neumann operator.
He will investigate
              necessary and sufficient conditions for 
compactness of the d-bar-Neumann
              problem in geometric and potential
theoretic terms.  He will also study
              eigenvalue spectrum of the
d-bar-Neumann problem by investigating, among other
              problems, 
the several complex variables analog of Mark Kac's question: ``Can
              one 
hear the shape of a drum?''.  In addition, the principal
              investigator
plans to study invariant metrics, in particularly, the Bergman
              and
Kobayashi metrics. He will consider boundary behavior and the zero set
              of
the Bergman kernel function, as well as completeness of the
              Kobayashi
metric.  Another problem to be studied is the theory of
              automorphism
groups and its relationship with the regularity of the
              d-bar-Neumann
problem. 

Complex analysis is a key tool in many areas of
              sciences and engineering.
For example, the Laplace transform is essential in
              the study of 
mechanical vibrations and electric circuits.  The Laplace
              equation 
has important applications to hydrodynamics, electrostatics, 
and
              heat conduction.  The problems under investigation in this project 
are not
              only intrinsically interesting, but also have implications in 
areas such as
              complex geometry, operator theory,  potential theory,
mathematical physics,
              and quantum mechanics.  Many tools to be used in
this project come from other
              branches of mathematics and sciences.  Some
problems may even rely on computer
              programming. The investigator will
also contribute to the development of human
              resources by supervising a
graduate student.
