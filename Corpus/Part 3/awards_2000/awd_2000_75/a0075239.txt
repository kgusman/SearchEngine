Abstract    :
                   The investigator develops efficient and reliable iterative
methods for
              reconstructing an image from recorded, noisy data.
To obtain better resolved
              images, he develops methods that can
effectively handle complicated operators
              (e.g., spatially variant
kernels) and methods that enforce a nonnegativity
              constraint.
     The emergence of increasingly sophisticated imaging
              devices
has produced a new generation of very difficult
              computational
problems in which an image is to be reconstructed from
              recorded
data.  Such problems arise, for example, in breast cancer
detection,
              where there is a tradeoff between the needs to obtain
high resolution images
              and to limit the radiation dose to the
patient.  New devices have also been
              recently proposed for
3-dimensional imaging, where high dimensionality and
              resolution
requirements result in nontrivial computational complexity. 
              Yet
another example occurs in new ground-based telescopes, which use
adaptive
              optics techniques.  To extract detailed information and
take advantage of the
              increase in resolution that can be obtained
from new imaging devices, it is
              important to develop methods that
take into account spatial changes of
              properties in the imaging
mechanisms, which are not amenable to standard fast
              Fourier
transform based methods.  New fully 3-dimensional medical
              imaging
devices require a new generation of computational methods
              to
efficiently reconstruct images from recorded data, and in order
for these
              new computational methods to find their way to clinical
use, it is important
              to provide software packages that allow for
easy implementation and
              experimentation.  Methods that enforce
nonnegativity in the computed solution,
              and that can efficiently
handle spatially variant kernels, are developed. 
              Many of the
computational tools developed in this project should
              be
applicable to a wide class of iterative image reconstruction
methods,
              including linear, nonlinear and statistical based
methods.
