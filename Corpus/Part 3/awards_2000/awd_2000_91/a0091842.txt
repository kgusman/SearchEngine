This grant provides three-years partial salary support for a
              research technician in the laboratories for stable isotope geochemistry at the
              California Institute of Technology.  This is a Phase I technician support grant
              under the Instruments and Facilities (IF) Program.  The stable isotope
              geochemistry technician at Caltech, Nami Kitchen, will provide the following
              contributions to our facility:  1) training of students, postdoctoral fellows,
              and visiting scientists in the use of instruments within this laboratory, 2)
              maintenance of gas-source mass spectrometers and other experimental apparatus;
              3) processing samples through established analytical procedures in support of
              research conducted by users of this laboratory; and 4) construction and
              refinement of components of new analytical apparatus.  Her greatest specific
              scientific contributions will be to provide continuous productivity and quality
              control for two semi-automated analytical methods developed in our laboratories
              over the last two years:  1) laser fluorination of minerals and glasses,
              applied to projects in petrology, mantle geochemistry, paleoclimate studies,
              and geobiology; and, 2) on-line reduction and D/H ratio measurement of trace
              quantities of water released from geological and meteoritic samples.  This
              second analytical method is a relatively recent development that we anticipate
              will be a foundation for an innovative and productive research program over the
              time-scale of this grant.
