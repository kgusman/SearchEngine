     The investigator analyzes how a propagating wave
              pulse
behave in a medium with rough variations.  Predicting the
evolution of
              the wave pulse from information about the
`roughness' of the medium is a
              problem of deep mathematical and
practical interest, as is the inverse problem
              of deducing
information about the medium from measurements of a
              transmitted
pulse.  Most often a detailed description of the (fine
              scale)
variations of the medium is not possible, only a description of
their
              statistical character.  Hence, the investigator considers
the fine scale
              medium variations as a realization of a stochastic
process.  This entails
              analysis of differential equations with
randomly varying coefficients.  The
              project has three specific
objectives: First, obtain a characterization of
              the
transformation of sound pulses propagating in a medium with a
continuum
              of length scales, a medium defined in terms of a random
fractal.  Second,
              extend and use theory about the transformation
of a wave pulse in some
              specific inverse problems, in particular,
high contrast seismic imaging and
              time reversal mirrors.  Third,
derive strict bounds for how an electromagnetic
              pulse can be
affected by the medium heterogeneity without knowing the
              details
of these variations.
     The main question the investigator
              addresses is: How does a
propagating wave behave in a medium that varies when
              the
variations are not small?  For instance, when a laser beam
propagates
              through the turbulent atmosphere how is it affected by
intense, turbulent,
              variations in the local speed of propagation?
When such medium variations are
              smooth, say with a constant
speed of propagation, the problem is well
              understood.  For rough
medium variations, as in the above example, the
              interaction of a
wave pulse with the medium heterogeneities is a fundamental
              yet
largely open question.  This problem, predicting the evolution of
signal
              or wave pulse that propagates in a rough medium, is of
deep mathematical and
              practical interest.  In addition to wave
propagation in the turbulent
              atmosphere there are many other
applications.  In reflection seismology the
              earth's crust is
probed with a wave pulse and the reflected pulses are used
              to
infer knowledge about macroscale variations in the medium.  It is
then
              important to know how the rough microscale variations in the
medium affect the
              probing pulse.  Remote sensing, ocean acoustics,
and medical imaging provide
              similar examples.  In communication
systems, it is important to be able to
              describe how medium
imperfections and variations affect the propagating
              signal.  In
the theory of composite materials, it is important to
              optimally
construct a complex material so that it has some
              desired
propagation properties.
