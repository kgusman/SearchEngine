Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the physics of plasma injections into the inner
              magnetosphere during magnetospheric substorms and storms.  The project will use
              a newly coupled model consisting of the UCLA global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
              model and the Rice Convection Model (RCM).  The coupled model will eliminate
              the shortcomings that are currently inherent to the models: the lack of a ring
              current and correct particle drift physics in the MHD code, and the dependence
              of the RCM on empirical submodels and ad hoc assumptions.  The coupling process
              will be done by using a novel data structure to exchange information between
              the models at certain times during the calculation, allowing the models to run
              in parallel, and not necessarily on the same computer.  The data exchange will
              be in the form of a protocol, similar to the protocols that are used on the
              World Wide Web, which will allow for maximum flexibility, extensibility and
              openness.  Coupling of the models will proceed in six stages of increasing
              complexity.  As each coupling stage is completed the investigators will model a
              set of selected substorm and storm events and perform comprehensive comparisons
              with in situ observations.  The comparisons will yield information about the
              relative importance of different processes.  The goal is to develop a global
              magnetosphere model with much improved capabilities compared to contemporary
              models, and a much more thorough understanding of substorm and storm time
              injections.
