The Barrett Lectures at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
              in
May 2000, "New Directions in Differential Geometry" will present
four main
              speakers and a number of additional lecturers.  These
talks will address a
              broad spectrum of recent work in the
subject, including lecture series by four
              leading researchers on
partial differential equations and analytic methods,
              minimal
surfaces, symmetries and isometries in Riemannian geometry,
              and
Lagrangian cycles in symplectic geometry.  The major component of
this
              award will support participation in the lecture series by
graduate students
              and recent Ph.D.s.

The Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1972,
              covering
a variety of topics and attracting a national audience.  They
              are
one of the few long standing lecture series in mathematics in
              the
southeastern United States.  The subject of these lectures for
2000 is
              differential geometry, the study of aspects of a space
that can be captured by
              measures of length, angle, surface area,
volume, and related notions. 
              Riemannian geometry concentrates on
issues related to curvature, the
              measurable quantity that makes
rigorous the notion that a flat plane and a
              round sphere are
distinct even at very small scales of attention. 
              Symplectic
geometry concerns an idealization of the structure underlying
              the
Hamiltonian framework for mechanics, a structure that
              enables
measurements of areas and volumes but does not require that
length
              and angles be measurable.  Both of these flavors of
geometric information have
              dramatic consequences for problems
concerning efficient or optimal placement
              of objects such as a
surface in a three-dimensional space, consequences which
              are
mostly expressed in the language of partial differential
equations and
              related ideas from mathematical analysis.
