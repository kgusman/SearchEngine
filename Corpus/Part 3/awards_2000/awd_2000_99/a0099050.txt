Abstract    :
              This ocean science technology development project will provide oceanographers
              with a shipboard instrument capable of separating and quantifying
              phycobiliproteins in seawater. No routine method currently exists for
              separating phycobiliproteins, despite the fact that they are diagnostic
              pigments for important phytoplankton groups. By combining expertise from
              various fields, the investigators plan to use capillary electrophoresis (CE)
              with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection to facilitate the determination
              of phycobiliproteins. By transposing conventional CE-LIF methods to a
              task-specific, monolithic microchip platform, and by incorporating
              acousto-optical deflection (AOD) for self-alignment of the laser in the
              detection scheme, the project will address difficulties that would otherwise be
              encountered by a shipboard phycobiliprotein measurement system.  The specific
              goals of the project include (1) optimization of conditions necessary for the
              separation and enumeration of individual phycobiliproteins in a mixture, along
              with optimal extraction procedures for these pigments from picophytoplankton;
              (2) design and construction of a micro-chip CE-LIF system with AOD-based laser
              beam scanning for self-aligning detection; and (3) employment of the micro-chip
              system developed on cruises to determine phycobiliproteins in natural water
              samples in "real time," and to compare these results with those of subsequent
              laboratory-based analyses to determine the effects of seawater sample storage
              and transport. Fulfillment of these goals will provide the oceanographic
              community with a robust, multidisciplinary tool capable of determining
              distributions and concentrations of various phytoplankton derived pigments like
              phycobiliproteins, which will facilitate studies of global primary production
              and carbon biomass.
