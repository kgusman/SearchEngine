ABSTRACT



Research is proposed on several open questions in
              Stochastic Analysis and
Optimization, including the following:

(i) 
              Bounded-Velocity-Follower problems, that involve filtering,
              absolutely
continuous stochastic control, and optimal stopping;
(ii)
              Bounded-Variation, Finite-Fuel Follower problems, which combine
features of
              singular stochastic control and optimal stopping;
(iii) Leavable Control
              problems for one-dimensional diffusions, and on
associated  stochastic games
              of the controller-and-stopper type;
(iv)  Leavable Utility Maximization
              problems, with an embedded ``retirement
option";
(v)   the Hedging of
              American Contingent Claims under portfolio constraints;
and
(vi)  a General
              Probabilistic Theory for Leavable Stochastic Control
Problems, based on
              martingales and on equivalent changes of measure.

Several of these problems
              share the following interesting feature: the
qualitative nature of the optimal
              policy changes significantly, as the
parameters weighing the relative
              importance of continuation cost, stopping
cost, and discount rate pass through
              certain critical values. We propose to
identify the critical parameters in
              problems of this type that admit exact
solutions, and to describe as
              explicitly as possible the associated optimal
control policies and stopping
              rules. It is expected that tools from
stochastic analysis, martingales, convex
              duality theory, partial
differential equations, and variational inequa-lities,
              will prove crucial in
the resolution of these questions; and that valuable new
              tools will have to
be developed, in order to deal with the non-standard issues
              that will arise.


The optimization questions that we plan to study over the
              next five years
share a common feature, in that they involve elements of both 
              Stochastic
Control  and of  Discretionary  Stopping. Such questions arise,
              for
instance, in  target-tracking models, where one has to stay close to
              a
target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived "sufficiently

              close" to the target, and then to decide whether to engage the target or
not.
              Combined stochastic control / optimal stopping problems also arise
              in
Mathematical Finance:  in
.  the context of computing the upper- and
              lower- hedging prices of American
   contingent claims under portfolio
              constraints;  in
.   portfolio/consumption optimization with an embedded
              "retirement option";
and in
.   the study of dynamic measures for managing
              risk.
The resolution of such problems, as suggested in this proposal, is
              expected
to advance significantly our understanding of stochastic optimization
              and
the frontiers of its applications.  The strong involvement of
              graduate
students in our research activities is expected to continue, and to
              be a
major factor in the advancement of Applied Probability and of
              the
Mathematics of
              Finance.
