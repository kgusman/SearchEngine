This
              research program addresses problems in two areas.  The
Virasoro conjecture in
              symplectic geometry asserts that the
generating function of the Gromov-Witten
              invariants for a compact
symplectic manifold must be annihilated by a sequence
              of
differential operators in the Virasoro algebra.  The
              principal
investigator will study whether the genus-one Virasoro
              conjecture
and perhaps more general constraints hold for all
              projective
varieties.  It is even possible that the generating function
              of
genus-one primary Gromov-Witten invariants can be computed
explicitly from
              the genus-zero invariants, although this is more
than the Virasoro conjecture
              implies.  The second area to be
addressed is submanifold geometry, especially
              the properties of
isoparametric submanifolds, including infinite
              dimensional
submanifolds.  We know some good constructions of
              isoparametric
submanifolds, but important aspects of the classification
              theory
are in early stages of development.

Geometric descriptions of
              classical or quantum mechanical systems
are based in symplectic geometry,
              which takes as its basic
measurement the area of two-dimensional surfaces. 
              The
Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold can be
described as a
              family of number that count the number of surfaces
of a nice sort that satisfy
              certain constraints, such as
intersecting specified subsets of the manifold. 
              Enumerative
invariants of this kind are an ancient concern in
              algebraic
geometry, where we count the number of solutions to a system
              of
equations, and the subject was recently found to be connected to
high
              energy physical theory, where the partition functions of
certain quantum
              systems on a manifold have been found to be
related to generating functions
              that collect families of
Gromov-Witten invariants into a manageable form.  The
              Virasoro
conjecture proposed by a group of physicists and
              mathematicians
asserts that these generating functions satisfy a family
              of
constraints that simplify computations and connect the
Gromov-Witten
              invariants to the mathematics of completely
different problems.  A different
              kind of geometry arises in the
study of submanifolds as curved objects, where
              we use several
measurements of bending to capture the intuitive sense that
              a
sphere in three-space is more curved if its radius is small than
if its
              radius is large.  An isoparametric submanifold is an
imbedded object which has
              particularly simple curvature
properties with respect to the larger space, and
              the character of
this specialty is driven by the fact that this local
              condition
frequently imposes strong symmetry properties the
              whole
submanifold.
