We
              propose to apply quantum dynamical notions to problems in
geometry, inverse
              spectral theory and mathematical physics.
First is the well-known problem,
              `Can you hear the shape of an
analytic drum?' We have constructed a `quantum
              Birkhoff normal
form' of the Laplacian around a bouncing ball orbit and
              have
proved that it is a spectral invariant. We will investigate the
extent
              to which a bounded simply connected analytic plane domain
is determined by its
              normal forms at one or more bouncing ball
orbits. We will also investigate a
              new connection between the
spectrum and X-ray tomography of the domain.  The
              second group of
problems involves applications of a recently
              developed
probabalistic theory of holomorphic sections of line bundles
              over
Kahler manifolds.  We have at this time determined much of the
local
              statistics of sections over small balls.  We have also
generalized the results
              to symplectic manifolds. We now aim to
apply these results to determine hole
              probabilities,
probabilities of transversality, and other matters which arise
              in
complex and symplectic geometry.  The third group of problems
belongs to
              Quantum Chaos. We have introduced a new model of
random quantum maps, obtained
              by quantizing stochastic
Hamiltonian flows.  We propose to investigate the
              main problems
of Quantum Chaos for this model.

Much of physics of the
              twentieth century has revolved around the
quantum mechanics of particles and
              fields, in particular around
the Schrodinger equation, and the physics and
              engineering of the
future will be even more quantum mechanical.  Quantum
              systems are
quite un-intuitive and one of the best ways to understand
              what
they do is to compare them to the classical systems which they
quantize.
              For instance, a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic
field can be thought of as
              a small particle moving in a force
field.  As the magnetic field gets
              stronger, the particle's
motion becomes more complex and chaotic. What does
              this say about
the quantum particle?  According to twenty years of
              numerical
studies, the behaviour of a chaotic quantum particle should
              be
random, with statistics similar to those for random matrices.
Why should
              solutions of the Schrodinger equation know anything
about random matrices? 
              Our approach is to introduce a new model
of chaotic quantum systems which
              allows one to consider large
families of systems at once.  In a sense, we are
              trying to
show that a `random' quantum system behaves similarly to a
`random'
              matrix, despite the differences in these systems.
Such a model should be able
              to explain observations ranging from
nuclear resonance levels to chemical
              reaction rates.
