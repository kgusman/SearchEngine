     The investigator and her colleagues organize
              a
multidisciplinary workshop on methods for macromolecular
modeling.  The aim
              is to bring together both developers of
computational tools for biomolecular
              simulations and those
biological and chemical scientists who use computer
              modeling to
study macromolecular problems.  The workshop highlights
              recent
advances in simulation techniques, most notably in the areas
              of
conformational sampling, fast electrostatics, molecular
              dynamics
integration, and quantum-mechanical calculations, that are
              having
significant impact on structural biology.  It surveys developments
in
              algorithmic approaches, hierarchical spatial representations,
and improved
              computing platforms that continue to enhance the
reliability of macromolecular
              simulations and increase their
applicability and relevance to biomolecular
              research.  The topics
highlighted are: (1) new methods for long-term molecular
              dynamics
simulations; (2) conformational sampling: equilibrium
              and
nonequilibrium processes; (3) multiscale modeling; (4)
quantum/classical
              mechanics; (5) fast electrostatics; and (6)
applications to enzyme catalysis,
              DNA modeling, and DNA/protein
systems.  The workshop is held at the Courant
              Institute of
Mathematical Sciences at New York University on October 12-14
              and
co-sponsored by SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics), as
              part of SIAM's new Activity Group in the Life
Sciences, as well as by National
              Science Foundation programs in
Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics,
              Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry, and Molecular Biophysics.
    
              Computational methods are increasingly being recognized as
valuable tools for
              the study of biomolecular structure and
function.  The interdisciplinary
              nature of biomolecular
computational approaches is largely driven by the many
              important
practical applications in the field, such as drug
              design,
biomedical engineering, and food chemistry.  The workshop
              program
provides a timely and unique opportunity for close interaction
and
              scientific exchange among biomolecular researchers, computer
scientists, and
              applied mathematicians.  In the era of integrative
science, such synergy
              kindles new ideas and helps educate young
scientists for cross-disciplinary
              research at the interface of
computational science and biology.  The meeting
              brings researchers
abreast of current developments in algorithms and
              computational
methods.  It also highlights critical problems in
              structural
biology and new application areas, and it
              fosters
interdisciplinary collaborations.  The results of the workshop
              are
disseminated through the collected scientific articles by the
invited
              speakers, which will be published in Springer Verlag's
Lecture Notes series in
              Computational Science and Engineering
(LNCSE).  These tangible records, in
              addition to a carefully
designed program, are expected to serve the community
              by
educating junior scientists at disciplinary interfaces,
stimulating new
              ideas in computational techniques for
macromolecular modeling, and identifying
              key areas for future
research.
