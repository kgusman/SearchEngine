Mountford
	Professor Mountford will continue investigating interacting
              particle systems.  Working in conjunction with Professor M. Bramson, he hopes
              to show the existence of "blocking measures" for the exclusion processes where
              the underlying random walk is finite range and possesses non-zero mean.  If
              successful, they intend to examine the question of characterizing the extremal
              invariant measures for these processes.  The key tool, the laws of large
              numbers of Rezakhanlou, will, it is to be hoped, also play a role in
              establishing convergence results for tandems of complicated Jackson networks. 
              Professor Mountford will also continue his research with Professor R. Dalang
              into path properties of the Brownian sheet.  In particular it is hoped to
              address how many distinct bubbles at a fixed (or a random level) can meet at a
              point.

	Professor Mountford will continue to work in the field of
              interacting particle systems.  These are random systems consisting of an
              infinite array of connected values which evolve according to simple rules
              governed by the current state of neighboring values.  What makes these
              processes interesting, both mathematically and scientifically, is that often
              there exist multiple, qualitatively different, equilibria for the same process.
               A major task is finding or characterizing all possible equilibria.  Currently
              Professor Mountford is working on this question for the exclusion process. 
              This is a process where particles try to move independently in a random
              fashion.  The (interesting) interacting part of the process comes from the rule
              that no two particles can occupy the same position and so moves by particles
              that would result in multiple occupancy are suppressed.
