     All organisms are composed of multiple chemical
              elements
such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.  Recent research in
              the
area known as ecological stoichiometry has highlighted the
ecological
              importance of the relative abundance of chemical
constituents, known to vary
              considerably among species and across
trophic levels.  However, most
              theoeretical studies in ecology
have until very recently ignored the sources
              and consequences of
this chemical heterogeneity.  The investigator and his
              colleagues
undertake theoretical investigations of ecological
              stoichiometry.
They develop a relatively new theoretical framework
              for
ecological dynamics that explicitly incorporates
              stoichiometric
constraints.  This base model involves a
              stoichiometric
counterpart of the familiar Rosenzweig-MacArthur equations
              in
which the effective carrying capacity of the resource species and
the
              transfer efficiency of the consumer species are constrained
by stoichiometric
              principles.  Introduction of stoichiometric
considerations in these equations
              (here, akin to "food quality")
allows for a rich array of ecologically
              realistic dynamics,
including deterministic extinction of the consumer species
              when
resources are abundant but of poor quality.  They expand this
model in
              five different directions, to explore ecological
realities (i.e.,
              complications) whose consideration has proved
illuminating in other,
              non-stoichiometric settings.  Specifically,
they analyze the dynamics of 1) a
              multi-nutrient model; 2)
trophically complex models in which multiple consumer
              species
share a resource; 3) time delays in nutrient recycling that are
              a
realistic component of terrestrial ecosystems; 4) two patch
models
              featuring habitat heterogeneity and dispersal of the
consumer; and 5) age
              structured models in which juvenile and
adult consumers differ in their
              nutrient requirements.  The
project aims to provide an analytically rigorous
              foundation for
burgeoning empirical research into ecological stoichiometry.
 
                 All living things, including humans, are constructed of
approximately the
              same set of basic building blocks, chemical
elements such as carbon (C),
              nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and
several dozen more in smaller amounts. 
              However, different
organisms contain different proportions of these key
              elements in
their biomass and thus must extract these elements from
              their
environment to differing degrees.  In many situations, the
environment
              does not provide these key nutrient elements in the
abundance and proportions
              that are optimal for organism growth
and reproduction.  Thus, the chemical
              environment of life may set
limits on the success of organisms in various
              situations.  In this
project the investigators use mathematical models to
              simulate the
flow of multiple chemical elements in natural food webs to
              better
understand how the requirements of living things for multiple
chemical
              elements establish key feedbacks between the living and
non-living world. 
              This work is important for two reasons.  First,
it may provide a better
              fundamental understanding of how chemical
elements move through food webs. 
              Second, improved fundamental
knowledge of how nutrients move in the
              environment and how to
simulate those movements with mathematical tools may
              help predict
and manage natural and human-dominated ecosystems,
              including
those affected by nutrient inputs from human activities (e.g. 
              N
and P inputs from fertilizer, sewage) or by global change (e.g.
effects of
              increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on C and nutrient
flow in the
              environment).
