Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies a variety of problems concerning
interface
              dynamics in fluids and materials.  The problems are 1)
control of droplet
              formation and 2) microstructral evolution in
anisotropic and inhomogeneous
              elastic media.  He brings together
physical experiments, modeling,
              mathematical and numerical
analysis, and large-scale scientific computations
              to study
certain fundamental problems related to interface motion, such
              as
interfacial pinch-off and evolutions of interfaces in
three-dimensional
              systems.  One of the major goals is to develop
and apply start-of-the-art
              computational tools with emphasis on
utilizing adaptive methods and parallel
              computing, and designing
robust numerical methods for integro-differential
              equations
involving multiple physical effects with multiple spatial
              and
temporal scales.
     The investigator studies some fundamental problems
              related
to multiphase phenomenon in physical systems.  In particular,
              he
develops mathematical models and performs large-scale
computations to
              investigate diffusional evolution of
microstructure in solid/solid phase
              transitions and control of
droplet formation in a fluid/fluid system.  Many
              structural
metals, such as steels, aluminum alloys and superalloys,
              are
products of solid-state diffusional transformations.  The
multi-phase
              microstructure resulting from such transformations is
a key variable in
              setting the macroscopic mechanical properties
such as stiffness, strength and
              toughness of the alloy.  A goal of
this study is to model and simulate the
              process of microstructure
evolution through mathematics and computations, and
              eventually to
provide engineers information on how to generate
              different
microstructures with desirable material properties. 
              The
investigation of droplets concerns how to control the formation
of drops
              of many sizes (frequently referred to as satellite
drops) in a situation like
              a dripping faucet or in the breakup of
a jet.  The presence of satellite drops
              is undesirable in many
practical situations such as in ink jet printers and
              disk
atomizers.  He studies the use of focused, external acoustic waves
for
              the control of satellite drops.  If successful, this idea can
be applied to
              many modern technologies.
