Abstract    :
                  The investigator studies connections between knot complexity
and polygonal
              knot spaces, and develops effective methods to
quantify and and characterize
              knots.  The project involves
computation and software development as well as
              analysis and
experiments.  With colleagues and students, the
              investigator
explores relationships between various experimental
              measurements
of complexity of knots in physical materials, such as DNA
              and
polymers, and mathematical characterizations of knot
              complexity.
Previously defined functions, such as energies and
              rope-length,
are compared to new quantities, such as measurements of
              the
convex hull and of a "smallest" box containing the knot, to
capture
              various spatial characteristics.  These quantities
predict the types of knots
              that are encountered as one moves
through knot space.  They also are used to
              understand changes
that occur in small and large-scale knotting in polygonal
              knot
space as a result of perturbations.
     From DNA replication to
              unraveling one's garden hose,
knotting and tangling are a part of many
              physical systems.  Some
knots are easier to tie (i.e. less complex), and thus
              more likely
to occur in these situations.  How does one quantify
              the
complexity of a knot?  What measurable attributes fully explain
the
              complexity of a mathematical knot (i.e. a closed loop in
space)? 
              Mathematicians have defined several functions, called
"knot energies" that
              quantify the "tangledness" of knots.
Simultaneously, scientists have completed
              physical experiments on
knots made of real materials, such as DNA and
              polymers, that
determine other measures of complexity.  To what extent are
              the
theoretical and experimental quantities related?  Are the
quantities
              delivering the same information or does each number
reveal something different
              about the knot?  In particular, can
one use these functions to create more
              realistic physical models
of DNA?  In this project, the investigator,
              colleagues, and
students explore the quantification of knot complexity and
              its
relation to spaces of polygonal knots by integrating theory with
computer
              simulation.  Previously defined theoretical measures,
such as energies and
              rope-length, are compared to new quantities,
such as the surface area and
              volume of the convex hull, to
capture various spatial characteristics related
              to the knot.
Physical experiments and computer simulations are performed
              and
statistical analysis applied to understand their interrelations.
These
              quantities also predict the types of knots that are
encountered as one moves
              through polygonal knot space and
explains changes that occur in small and
              large-scale knotting as
a result of perturbations.  This provides scientists
              with a
better understanding of the mathematical models that are
currently
              employed and suggest refinements to improve these
models.
