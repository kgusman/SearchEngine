Abstract    :
              
Modern operating systems are large and complex code bases in which
hundreds
              of programmer-years have been invested. As a result,
modifying an operating
              system is a difficult, costly, and often
impractical endeavor. However,
              viewing the OS as an immutable object
is at odds with most OS
              research.

This research proposes techniques that enable the deployment of
              OS
ideas without changing OS source code. The thesis is that an
              OS-like
service can acquire information about the internal state of the OS
              and
control its behavior, even when no explicit interfaces to do so
              are
provided. With this approach, the OS is treated as a gray box, in
which
              the general characteristics of its algorithms are known; this
knowledge is
              then combined with run-time observations of how the OS reacts
to probes in
              order to infer its state and exert control.

Initial experience with gray-box
              systems points to additional areas of
research: automated discovery of
              algorithms, on-line benchmarking to
configure parameters, dynamic insertion of
              probes, and aggressive
inference of OS internal state.  Thus, the goal of this
              proposal is
two-fold: to understand the theoretical foundations of
              gray-box
systems and to implement a toolbox of software for the
              rapid
development of gray-box systems.
