Abstract    :
              Speculative execution has been widely used in computer architecture
research in
              the pursuit of higher levels of instruction level
parallelism.  However,
              recent studies have shown that this technique
can significantly impact the
              scalability of the processor pipeline.
This research will investigate a number
              of speculative techniques
with respect to performance, scalability, energy
              efficiency, area
costs, and complexity; eventually leading to a novel,
              scalable
architecture to provide high performance at future technology
              sizes.
Such an architecture will minimize the amount of logic on the
critical
              timing path of the processor, relying on small speculative
structures to
              reduce the cycle time of the processor.  Off the
critical path, a variety of
              larger speculative structures provide a
backing store to the critical
              path.

Some of the techniques to be examined in this research include
branch
              prediction, value and address prediction, data prefetching,
early register
              release and late register allocation, and multiple
clustered functional units.
               Many of these techniques require large
and often complex predictors that can
              impact the cycle time and power
density of a processor.  This research
              investigates some techniques
to reduce the access time and size of these
              structures, while still
providing the accuracy to avoid costly speculative
              recovery
procedures.
