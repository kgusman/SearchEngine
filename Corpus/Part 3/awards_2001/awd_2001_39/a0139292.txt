Abstract    :
              On Tuesday, September 11, 2001, terrorists struck the United States by hijacking
              planes in Boston, Washington D.C., and Newark and crashing them into the World
              Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in rural Pennsylvania.  Tuesday,
              September 11, 2001 has immediately been classified with a small group of
              "infamous" dates, including December 7, 1941, November 22, 1963, April 4, 1968,
              January 28, 1986, and April 19, 1995.  Each of these dates mark tragic and
              history-altering events in America.  Furthermore, most Americans who witnessed
              these days will tell you, "I remember exactly where I was when I heard the
              news".  Cognitive psychologists have referred to the phenomenon of exceptional
              memory for salient events as "flashbulb memory".  To the layperson, flashbulb
              memories are unique in that they are more vivid and more easily recalled than
              other memories.  However, research on flashbulb memory has suggested that they
              are not special.  Instead, research suggests that flashbulb memories are
              susceptible to the same restructuring processes as other memories.  However,
              research on flashbulb memory is limited for obvious reasons.  Further, since
              the cognitive revolution of the 1950's, this country has witnessed very few
              events that compare to the events of Tuesday, September 11.  If ever there was
              an event that should fall under the category of "flashbulb" this one should be
              it.  Therefore, the purpose of this project is to assess people's memory for
              the events of Tuesday, September 11.  Memory for events, confidence in memory,
              and emotional reaction will be assessed immediately (i.e., approximately one
              week following the events) and will be assessed again 11 and 23 months later. 
              The hypothesis under investigation is whether salient events, which are
              accompanied by strong affect and emotion, are recalled with accuracy over a
              long period of time, or whether memory of these events is susceptible to
              distortion.
