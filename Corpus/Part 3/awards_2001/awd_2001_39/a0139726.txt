ABSTRACT FOR MICHAEL TAYLOR'S PROJECT



Professor Taylor proposes to investigate problems in partial differential
equations, particularly in the areas of wave propagation, boundary problems 
for elliptic PDE, and functional calculus for elliptic self-adjoint 
operators.  Taylor will study wave propagation in fairly rough media, 
in which rays of geometrical optics are just barely defined, and in even
rougher media, in which such rays are not uniquely defined.  He will examine
to what extent wave propagation in such media behaves like that in more
regular media and to what extent it differs.  He plans to pursue the effects
of curvature bounds on a manifold on the nature of such wave propagation,
and also investigate propagation, reflection, and diffraction of waves at
a boundary for a rough medium.  Taylor will also continue a program of
studying elliptic equations with rough coefficients on Lipschitz domains.
This will include nonlinear equations, such as arise in the study of
harmonic maps between manifolds with rough metric tensors.  In the area
of functional calculus, one attack is to synthesize general functions
of the Laplace operator from the solution operator to the wave equation.
A detailed knowledge of wave propagation can then yield highly nontrivial
information on such functional calculus.  Taylor is pursuing a variety
of projects in this area, ranging from detailed behavior of eigenfunction
expansions to singular perturbation problems arising in the study of 
pattern formation.

Wave motion, from sound passing through air to pressure and shear waves
passing through the earth to radio waves traveling through space, is
a ubiquitous phenomenon, whose mathematical analysis has for a long time
been a major part of mathematics.  A variety of partial differential
equations have arisen to describe different aspects of wave motion, and their
study continues to stimulate work on analytical tools to elucidate the
behavior of solutions to such PDE.  Analyzing a wave as a superposition 
of various frequencies gave rise to the area of harmonic analysis.  
Localizing the study of a wave simultaneously in space and in frequency is 
at the heart of the more recent area of microlocal analysis.  Taylor has  
been active in developing tools in these areas and using them to produce
results in PDE.  Some of his efforts have focused on treating PDE with
rough coefficients and PDE in domains with rough boundary.  These arise
to describe waves traveling through complicated media, whose boundaries
have many corners and other irregularities.  While harmonic analysis 
techniques have provided much insight into partial differential equations,
the reverse direction has also led to significant results in harmonic
analysis.  Taylor is continuing to investigate how results on Fourier
synthesis of singular functions can be explained in terms of propagation
and focusing of waves.
