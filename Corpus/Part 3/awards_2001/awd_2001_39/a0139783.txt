ABSTRACT:


Fundamental problems are addressed in
              wavelet theory, non-uniform
sampling, frames, and the theory of spectral-tile
              duality. These
problems are inextricably interwoven by concept and
technique.
              Operator theory provides the major unifying framework,
combined with an
              integration of ideas from a diverse spectrum of
mathematics including
              classical Fourier analysis, noncommutative
harmonic analysis, representation
              theory, operator algebras,
approximation theory, and signal processing.  For
              example, the
construction, implementation, and ensuing theory of single
              dyadic
orthonormal wavelets in Euclidean space requires significant
              input
from all of these disciplines as well as deep spectral-tile
              
results.

There is intrinsic mathematical importance in the aforementioned
              
problems,  and the solutions to be formulated have broad and 
creative
              implications, both for mathematics and for applications 
in engineering and
              physics. The topics of this project have 
direct bearing on fast acquisition
              and motion problems in MRI, 
as well as in formulating algorithms for
              compression and noise 
reduction by means of proper cochlear modelling. There
              are further
applications in quantum computing and image processing, and the
              
development of non-uniform sampling strategies by this project 
play  a role
              in state of the art A/D conversion methods used in 
multifunction RF systems. 
              These interdisciplinary applications 
depending on modern mathematical
              analysis have educational 
implications in terms of cross-fertilization of
              ideas and research
opportunities for graduate students.
