Abstract    :
              On September 11, 2001, World Trade Center towers collapsed because of a
              terrorist attack.  The twin 110-story buildings had tube steel structures steel
              and were the fifth and sixth tallest buildings in the world with a height of
              about 1365 feet. The tragic collapse due to this criminal act will require
              comprehensive analyses of the structure subjected to initial impact of airplane
              as well as the intense fire that followed.  Such analyses no-doubt will be
              conducted in the future to establish the cause(s) of the collapse and failure
              sequence in order to improve design of new buildings and retrofit existing
              structures.  The studies will need reliable data on mechanical properties of
              materials used in the towers, actual as-built steel connections and members as
              well as floor systems.  The objective of this SGER is to conduct post-disaster
              reconnaissance and collection of perishable data.  Specifically, samples of
              material and structural members and connections that later can be used to
              establish their properties will be collected. Of particular interest is to
              collect samples of steel from areas that were heavily affected by heat of the
              jet fuel and/or impact of the planes.    The PI is collaborating with David
              McCallen of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who is providing
              expertise in computational mechanics, modeling and analysis of large structural
              systems.  He is also collaborating with Frederick Mowrer of the University of
              Maryland who is collecting perishable data on the fire protection engineering
              aspects of the WTC.  Together, the data obtained in these projects will be of
              critical importance to future analyses of the WTC collapses.
