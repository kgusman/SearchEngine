Abstract    :
              
The global theory of minimal surfaces in space is in a phase of
explosive
              growth.  Many new methods of constructing complete
embedded minimal surfaces
              have recently been found; in place of a
dearth of examples just a few years
              ago, we now have a quite
varied collection of surfaces, including infinite
              families. A
basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect
              them
into families with common properties and understood
limits. Fruitful
              approaches have recently been developed that
combine numerical simulation with
              methods from the theory of
geometric structures on surfaces and classical
              complex analysis,
notably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team
              will
attack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one
heliciodal end
              and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk
surface the unique
              desingularization of a pair of planes?  Of
what families is the Scherk surface
              the limit point? At the same
time, the group hopes to make progress on
              simulation of minimal
surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of
              Weierstrass
representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible,
              fully
documented, and useful as a research tool.

A guiding philosophy in
              many areas of science, from physics to
biochemistry to ecology, is that nature
              is maximally efficient;
indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at
              their
foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some
or
              several of its features in the expression we witness.  At its
base, this
              philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we
search for principles in
              science that can be formulated as
extremal problems. In mathematics, we can
              make this assumption of
optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an
              equation.  This
leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the
              solutions
of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very
              rich
type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which
is
              already known to have a number of quite subtle
characteristics. (A minimal
              surface is one for which each small
piece has less area than any other surface
              with the same
boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins
              in
physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,
the
              problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating
droplets and
              soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications
range from cosmology to the
              understanding of the structure of
stable periodic structures in compound
              copolymers. As in many
other optimization problems, for the minimal surface
              problem, we
do not have much general information about solutions to
              the
equation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a
wide
              variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and
which we are
              beginning to organize. It is thus a good model
problem, enriching our
              understanding of all optimization
problems.
