While previous studies in
              the Atlantic Ocean and Arabian Sea have documented a direct relationship
              between atmospheric dust deposition  and reactive trace element additions to
              surface waters, little is known about the effect that the Asian dust plume has
              on the distribution of reactive trace elements in surface waters of the western
              North Pacific.  For this reason, PIs from the University of Hawaii, Old
              Dominion University and Florida State University will participate in a cruise
              to the central and western North Pacific during April/May 2002, a time period
              coincident with maximum Asian dust over that region.  During this cruise the
              following four research objectives will be addressed:  (1) quantify the areal
              extent and concentration of atmospheric dust in this region using dissolved Al
              concentrations in surface water samples and compare results with estimates
              obtained during field studies carried out as part of the ACE-ASIA program in
              2001, as well as historical deposition models; (2) compare the solubility of
              bioactive trace metals in aerosols and rainwater along with their concentration
              and distribution in surface water samples versus Al values to assess the role
              that atmospheric deposition has in controlling/altering the upper ocean
              biogeochemical cycles of these elements; (3) ascertain the magnitude and
              pathways via which atmospheric inputs get incorporated into the thermocline and
              central waters of the North Pacific; and (4) provide baseline concentrations
              for trace metals. The PIs will collect surface samples while underway by
              pumping water onto the ship through a Teflon-lined, polyethylene tube mounted
              on a modified bathythermograph and vertical profiles at 8 stations that will
              encompass the key hydrographic regimes of the area.  Samples (total,
              particulate, dissolved, colloidal) will be analyzed for the metals Ag, Al, Cd,
              Cu, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and the metalloids As, Sb, Se. Aerosols and rainfall
              samples also will be collected and analyzed for metals/major ions and
              metals/metalloids, respectively.  In addition, selected samples also will be
              analyzed for nutrients, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll a, particulate organic
              carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, particulate organic sulfur, dissolved
              organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen.
