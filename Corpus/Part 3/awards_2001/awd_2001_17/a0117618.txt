Abstract    :
              0117618 Lumpkin
Inverse modeling techniques will be used to resolve the
              transports in the Southern Ocean as port of the synthesis phase of the World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The box inverse model, applied to
              circumpolar hydrographic sections following the Subantarctic Front and southern
              ACC front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, along with multiple WOCE and
              other high-quality hydrographic data. The model will explicitly include air-sea
              transformations to solve for a set of reference velocities and
              property-dependent effective diapycnal velocities, and corrections to these
              fluxes consistent with property conservation in neutral density layers.
              Previous studies of the global thermohaline circulation by means of inverse box
              models have been severely restricted by their lack of controlling sections
              within the Southern Ocean, and therefore were not able to distinguish
              meridional exchanges among the different circulation regimes in the regions
              south of about 32 S.
