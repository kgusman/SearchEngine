	Funds are requested for the design, construction
              and testing of a small experiment module (SEM) for use in ocean bottom
              observatories. The purpose of this module is to reduce the effort necessary to
              conduct relatively simple observatory experiments at the ocean floor. Ocean
              bottom observatories will soon be providing opportunities for investigators to
              conduct scientific investigations using power from the observatory and
              transmitting data to shore through the observatory. The interface between the
              observatory and the scientist's sensors is intimidating for many investigators,
              requiring consideration of sampling, filtering, digitizing, timing, power, and
              data formatting, as well as construction of sophisticated electronics, pressure
              vessels, buoyancy devices, and related hardware. The proposed module will
              greatly simplify this task, allowing investigators to concentrate on their
              science, rather than on engineering. While those investigators with engineering
              expertise available will not necessarily need such an interface, the
              installation of relatively simple experiments coupled to a SEM will be far less
              complicated, making it easier and more cost effective for many to participate
              in observatory science. We envision a package similar to the SEM available at
              nearly every science node of major ocean bottom observatories. The prototype
              proposed here should point out any shortcomings in our conceptual design for
              such a device, and establish its usefulness to the community.
	The prototype
              of this package will include ports for connection of up to twelve sensors,
              including an absolute pressure sensor for tsunami detection. It is proposed
              that the first SEM at the Hawaii-2 Observatory will be installed during the
              next visit to the site in 2002 or 2003. Future versions of the SEM can be
              modified to the needs of a particular observatory.
