Abstract    :
              This National Science Foundation and Environmental Protection Agency
              Technologies for a Sustainable Environment project proposes a new technology to
              enable continuous casting of molten metals, in a single step, to the
              specifications of the designer.  Bessemer's vision (1865) of solidifying raw
              material directly into final product, without downstream processing steps
              (rolling, annealing), may now be realized for thin flat product, to marked
              environmental advantage.  To cast aluminum foil, e.g., in a single step, would
              reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by 250,000  tons per year, in the US
              alone. Every kilogram of aluminum saved in reducing manufacturing waste
              translates into electricity saved at the energy-hungry smelter.  The technology
              is based on controlling length scales previously inaccessible to control. The
              idea is a marriage between laser and single-roll spin casting technologies. 
              The laser offers a unique way to bring energy into the zone of contact between
              molten metal and substrate.  The contact zone is a region of adverse
              conditions, generally inhospitable to mechanical intrusion.  Successful casting
              by design, or tunable casting, will use laser energy to manipulate product
              quality.  One approach is to condition the substrate by imposing thermal
              gradients before the contact zone.  Grey-scales in ink-jet printing are
              produced by the spacing and arrangements of ink dots of the same size.  In much
              the same way, the proposed gradients will be established with arrangements and
              spacing of hot spots. Laser heating will induce the hot spots at fine scales.
              

This project will have significant societal benefits in reducing
              environmental impact and energy consumption, as well as providing improved
              scaled-down processing requirements for industry.
