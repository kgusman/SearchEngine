Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for an advanced network connection in order to
              facilitate research and education in the following ways:
Computational
              Astrophysics-Use of remote supercomputer for large-scale, 3D simulations of
              supersonic gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics to study star formation
              (funded by NSF Career Award, NASA and NSF Awards);
Observational
              Astrophysics-Survey for High Proper-Motion Stars-This will speed up the
              investigation and cataloging of millions of stars and answer some fundamental
              questions about the nature of white dwarf stars based on terrabytes of data at
              the Johns Hopkins' Space Telescope Science Institute (funded by NSF,
              NASA);
Digital Library Project-Sharing of Museum Data (32 million specimens
              and cultural artifacts) to the scientific community at large;
Comparative
              Genomics/Evolutionary Biology-Multiple projects (funded by NSF, NASA)
High
              resolution Virtual Specimens for Morphometrics-Dissemination of very large 3D
              specimen object datasets over high speed networks to provide a database of
              virtual objects (funded by NSF) ;
Center for Biodiversity-Various Projects
              including humpback whale research, remote sensing research taking place
              worldwide, including Vietnam, Madagascar, Bahamas (funded by NSF, NASA,
              Private) ;
Geology-Improve the remote operation of a microprobe, housed at
              AMNH, from Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University (funded by
              NSF)
Interdepartmental Labs-Remote collaborative work via remote operation of
              telescopes and microscopes;
Hayden Planetarium-Development of new Digital Dome
              shows  which involves the acquisition of images, remote supercomputing for
              rendering of visualizations, remote collaboration in development.
