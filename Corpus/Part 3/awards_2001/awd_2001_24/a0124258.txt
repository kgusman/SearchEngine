Abstract    :
              The PIs will combine recent compilations of optical properties of various
              atmospheric-borne minerals and their regional distribution in order that dust
              optical properties reflect the mineralogy of their source region. They will
              address the following questions: (i) How does the composition of a dust plume
              vary along its trajectory away from the source region, as the size distribution
              changes with the preferential deposition of larger particles? Is the fraction
              of certain minerals enriched with distance from the source? (ii) What is the
              horizontal distribution of atmospheric concentration and deposition for
              particular minerals, e.g., carbonates, clays such as illite and kaolinite, and
              hematite? (iii) What is the radiative forcing by dust aerosols and the climate
              response if the mineralogy of the source region is accounted for? (iv) What
              regional errors in forcing and the associated climate response result from
              assigning optical properties of far-traveled Saharan dust to each source
              region? (v) What is the radiative effect of treating particles as external
              mixtures? 

To address these questions the PIs will undertake modeling that
              includes the effect of subgrid scale fluctuations of surface wind upon dust
              emission. The work is important because it will enhance our understanding of
              the role of dust particle mineralogy upon climate.
