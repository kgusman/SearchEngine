Abstract    :
              This research examines  the relationship between fiscal decentralization and 
              economic policy reforms  among a small sample of countries in Africa. The first
              objective is to conduct a spectral analysis of the decentralization process in
              four countries on the basis of selected indicators of fiscal decentralization.
              This allows a ranking of each country's reform process on a spectral continuum
              between the two extremes of absolute centralization and absolute
              decentralization.  The second objective is to conduct an empirical test of the
              relationship between decentralization and central government fiscal position,
              using a non-parametric approach to analyze correlations between and among the
              decentralization and macroeconomic indicators. The hypothesis to be tested is
              that if fiscal decentralization is enacted in the context of a strong,
              transparent, and credible institutional and political framework, fiscal
              decentralization need not undermine reforms at the national level. The results
              of this research will enable the development of  a larger research proposal
              that considers data and empirical models that capture the effects of
              decentralization on the fiscal position of central government for  a larger
              sample of countries in Africa
