Abstract    :
                WORKSHOP: 2001 SIGART / AAAI Doctoral Consortium    This is a standard
              award to support the 6th SIGART / AAAI Doctoral Consortium, to be held as a
              workshop during the 17th International Joint Conference on Artificial
              Intelligence (IJCAI'01), August 4-10 in Seattle.  The Doctoral Consortium will
              provide a unique opportunity for a group of PhD students to discuss and explore
              their research interests and career objectives together with a panel of
              established researchers.  The event is similar in spirit to that funded by NSF
              last year, and has once again attracted a diverse group of student participants
              who reflect a wide range of topic areas and methodologies within artificial
              intelligence, and who have settled on their thesis directions but who still
              have significant research left to do.  Selection was based on clarity and
              completeness of the submission packet, stage of research, advisor's letter, and
              other evidence of promise such as published papers or technical reports;  a
              complete list of the 14 participants' names and affiliations may be found at
              	http://www.acm.org/sigart/DCparticipants.html.  Abstracts of the participants'
              presentations will be published in the issue of SIGART "Intelligence" that
              follows the consortium. The request for NSF support is higher this year than
              last, because Microsoft corporation chose not to cosponsor the event this time.
               Doctoral Consortium co-chairs are the PI and Marie desJardins, University of
              Maryland at Baltimore County;  the organizing committee also included Janyce M.
              Wiebe, University of Pittsburgh;  Mary P. Harper, Purdue University;  Vibhu O.
              Mittal, Just Research and CMU;  and Evangelos Milios, Dalhousie University. 
              Panelists for the 2-day event will include:  Robert St. Amant, North Carolina
              State University;  Maria Gini, University of Minnesota; Craig Knoblock, ISI &
              USC; Gerhard Lakemeyer, Aachen University of Technology; Evangelos Milios,
              Dalhousie University; Shlomo Zilberstein, University of Massachusetts at
              Amherst;  Stuart Shapiro, SUNY Buffalo;  Foster Provost, NYU;  and Rebecca
              Bruce, University of North Carolina at Asheville.
