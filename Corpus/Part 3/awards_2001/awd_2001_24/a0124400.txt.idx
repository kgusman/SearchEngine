Abstract    :
              Abstract CTS-012440 Beckman, Eric U of Pittsburgh  Design and Optimization
              of Non-Fluorous CO2-Philic Polymers   The application of CO2 to chemical
              processing continues to elicit significant interest, as CO2 generally poses
              fewer hazards than conventional organic solvents. At one time it was thought
              that CO2 could simply replace many organic solvents, but subsequent work showed
              that CO2 is a rather feeble solvent, and hence unrealistically high pressures
              are needed to dissolve compounds of interest. The discovery during the 1990's
              of  "CO2-philes" suddenly rendered a number of applications technically
              possible, greatly raising interest in CO2 as a solvent. These new CO2-philes,
              primarily fluoropolymers, allowed a host of new applications for CO2, from
              heterogeneous polymerization to homogeneous catalysis. Although fluorinated
              amphiphiles were technically successful, their high cost renders the economics
              of a process unfavorable unless the "CO2-phile" can be recycled at greater than
              99% efficiency. The drawbacks inherent to the use of fluorinated precursors
              have greatly inhibited the commercialization of most new applications for CO2,
              and thus the full promise of CO2-based technology has yet to be realized.
              Consequently, we have investigated the design of non-fluorous CO2-philes.
              First, a set of thermodynamic heuristics for the design of non-fluorous
              CO2-philes was developed. The applicability of these rules-of-thumb was
              demonstrated by the design of poly(ether-carbonates), polymers that exhibit
              lower miscibility pressures in CO2 than perfluoropolyethers and are
              biodegradable. The method of synthesis of these materials readily allows
              generation of surfactants and other functional molecules, opening the
              economical use of CO2 to a variety of processes. To date, we have used our
              simple heuristics to design three types of non-fluorous CO2-phile; we expect
              that others will ultimately be found, greatly broadening the applicability of
              CO2 as a solvent.    The number of possible design variables (copolymer
              composition and topology) creates an impractically large program if we continue
              to synthesize and test all potentially useful structures. Further, conventional
              thermodynamic models are incapable of predicting the behavior of all of the
              possible permutations. Consequently, we propose to conduct a program whose
              ultimate aim is to fully understand the effect of composition and topology on
              the phase behavior of our new CO2-philes in carbon dioxide. We propose to
              combine targeted synthesis, measurement of selected thermophysical properties,
              high pressure FT-IR, and development of an accurate potential function from
              first principles to mathematically describe the thermodynamics of mixing of our
              materials with CO2. Success will allow us to numerically optimize the structure
              of non-fluorous CO2-philes.  Research at the University of Pittsburgh will
              focus on the synthesis of model materials, investigation of phase behavior, and
              creation of a thermodynamic model that describes the effects of molecular
              structure on phase behavior. These tasks will be coordinated with research
              underway at Auburn University (C.R. Roberts), where high pressure IR
              measurements will be employed to evaluate the strength of specific interactions
              of CO2 with the Lewis base groups incorporated into our model polymers. The
              high pressure IR work provides input both to the synthetic design and the
              construction of an accurate potential model for CO2-polymer interactions.
