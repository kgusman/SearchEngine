Abstract    :
                  The mammalian anterior pituitary gland is a major organ for neuroendocrine
              function because it secretes multiple, important hormones.  During development,
              proteins known as transcription factors regulate activation of the genes that
              encode these hormones.   Two transcription factors of the LIM homeodomain
              group, Lhx3 and Lhx4, are involved in the specification of the
              hormone-secreting cells in the anterior pituitary.  Very little is known about
              the biochemical mechanisms by which these factors exert their specific gene
              regulatory functions.  Lhx3 exists in different isoforms, which have distinct
              DNA-binding and gene regulatory properties.  This project uses molecular and
              biochemical approaches to test the hypothesis that Lhx3 is a phosphoprotein
              that is modified at multiple locations, and that phosphorylation of Lhx3
              modulates its gene regulatory properties.  Lhx3 will be expressed, purified and
              analyzed by mass spectrometry techniques, and modified isoforms will be changed
              by site-directed mutatgenesis.  The DNA binding, gene regulatory properties,
              involvement of intracellular signaling pathways, and localization of these
              modified Lhx3 molecules will be tested using reporter genes, constitutively
              active signaling enzymes and confocal microscopy.  Experiments also will test
              to what extent Lhx4 has similar, but distinct, transcriptional properties to
              Lhx3.  An important issue from genomics is to understand how a limited number
              of genes can mediate the development of complex organisms, and this study shows
              an example of how multiple proteins can be generated from individual genes, and
              how their functions depend on post-transcriptional regulation.
   Results will
              have an impact beyond neuroendocrinology, because LIM proteins are required for
              development and function of many other systems in both animals and plants.
              Training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students also are an
              integral part of this project.
