Abstract    :
                   This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research ways to increase
              accessibility and utilization of microdata from censuses of the U.S. and other
              countries in secondary school and college courses in mathematics.  A seamless,
              XML-driven interface to a web server at the Minnesota Population Center will
              make it possible for teachers and students to specify, request, and import this
              microdata into Fathom Dynamic Statistics software.  Enhancements to Fathom
              software will increase its already considerable ease and power for working with
              census microdata; curriculum materials in mathematics will provide teachers
              with effective ways to begin working with this highly motivating data--both to
              teach existing content and to teach data literacy.  Phase I research suggested
              strong similarities between census microdata and school census microdata data
              that is gathered by K-12 schools about student demographics and performance,
              course offerings, and classroom practice.  Accordingly, Phase II leverages this
              overlap to produce greatly needed interfaces for easily accessing school census
              microdata, survey tools for producing it, and extensions to Fathom for
              analyzing it.
     KCP Technologies' census microdata project exploits the
              merging web connectivity in American schools, thus symbiotically fitting a
              larger pattern of evolution of school technologies.  The project offers a
              product that supports analysis of complex data through an easy-to-use interface
              which will contribute to data anlysis and learning from data analysis.  U.S.
              education is very much in need of the kinds of software and curriculum
              resources to be produced under this project
