We are seeking support for the travel costs of speakers invited to
              participate in the 17th Penn State Symposium in Plant Physiology to be held May
              16-18, 2002 in State College, Pennsylvania. This symposium is entitled "Plant
              reproduction: from evolutionary and physiological analyses to molecular and
              cellular studies." Plant reproductive biology has been a subject of great
              interest and intrigue for many generations.  In recent years, there have been
              very rapid advances in our understanding of plant development not only from
              molecular genetic studies, but also from evolutionary and physiological
              analyses. The goal of this meeting is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for
              leading researchers working in diverse areas of plant reproductive biology to
              present their recent findings, to share their ideas, and to stimulate each
              other in discussions. The symposium will bring together about 20 outstanding
              scientists from around the world, many of whom do not regularly attend the same
              meetings because of their wide-ranging specialties. In addition to the invited
              talks, we anticipate having approximately 50 contributed posters summarizing
              current research by scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate
              students. The results presented at the symposium will be summarized in a
              meeting report to be published by one of the leading plant journals. 
This
              symposium will provide a valuable service to the research community. We are not
              aware of any other symposia that have considered this topic in such an
              integrated and comprehensive manner.  By bringing together scientists using
              different approaches to study the problems in plant reproduction, the symposium
              will facilitate novel collaborations and experimental approaches, and will
              further stimulate progress in this fast advancing and growing field.
