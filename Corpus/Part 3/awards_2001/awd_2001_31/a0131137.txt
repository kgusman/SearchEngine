Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon in Eugene will
              acquire an X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas including the following: a) development of  novel multilayer
              synthesis of metastable solids; b) characterization of metal-organic
              multilayers with nonlinear optical properties; c) determination of the
              structure and size distribution of gold nanoparticles; d) preparation and
              characterization of inorganic semiconductor | conjugated polymer interfaces; e)
              low temperature synthesis of new oxide materials using salt metathesis
              reactions from non-aqueous solvents; and f) synthesis and characterization of
              novel metal dichalcogenide superlattices.

The X-ray diffractometer allows
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.  These studies will lead to the development of novel
              materials important to the electronics and optics industries.
