ABSTRACT

Wavelet
              expansions are a mathematical tool that enable
functions and data to be
              analyzed at multiple scales and
locations simultaneously. The investigator
              seeks first to
characterize all (non-tight) wavelet frames - these
              frames
permit more flexibility than the widely-used orthonormal
wavelets.
              Then he aims to characterize and find examples
of wavelets whose dilation
              matrices expand in some directions
but not in others. Another goal is to prove
              that the
"Mexican hat" wavelet family is dense in all Lebesgue spaces,
so
              that this family can be used to approximate data in more
than just the
              mean-square sense. On a different topic, the
investigator will also pursue
              questions about the fundamental
model equations that underlie motion of thin
              fluid films. The
proposed research aims to mathematically determine
              the
stability of steady states of these equations. In particular,
"droplet"
              steady states will be studied. The existence of such
stable steady states
              would signal the possibility of creating
a pattern in the film.

Wavelet
              theory draws on fundamental mathematics and on
engineering disciplines such as
              signal processing to create
tools for efficiently analyzing and storing
              information.
The two-way street between basic research and
              practical
applications has been particularly effective in recent
              years.
Abstract mathematical theories from harmonic analysis have
been
              transformed into large scale engineering solutions (for
example the FBI uses a
              wavelet compression technique to store
its fingerprint images), while
              engineering challenges continue
to stimulate fundamental research in
              mathematics. Many
questions about the mathematical equations of fluid flow
              are
famously difficult. In view of this difficulty, much research
has
              concentrated on special situations, such as a thin film of
fluid either
              sitting on or hanging from a flat surface. These
films arise in many
              industrial coating situations, such as the
manufacture of photographic film,
              or the coating of magnetic
disk drives. The mathematical understanding of
              these problems
became substantial only in the 1990s, and even now, much
              more
is known in one space dimension than in the physically relevant
case of
              two space dimensions, where this research will
concentrate.
