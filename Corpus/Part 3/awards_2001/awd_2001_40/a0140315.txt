Abstract    :
              Observing neutrinos requires large detectors and great patience. Neutrinos are
              able to cross the entire universe, traversing space, planets, galaxies at
              almost the speed of light, without leaving a mark. Only the extremely rare
              collision with the core of an atom stops a neutrino and reveals its presence,
              transforming it into a charged particle. Depending on the type of neutrino
              hitting an atom, either an electron or a similar but heavier particle emerges
              from the collision. Physicists can detect light emitted by the charged
              particle, thereby learning more about the properties of the initial
              neutrino.
MiniBoone is an experiment at Fermilab designed to measure neutrino
              masses. 

The specific goal of this proposal is to fund detector equipment
              for a novel kaon secondary beam monitor which will constrain the background in
              the neutrino beam. 

 While playing an important role in a large high energy
              physics experiment, this effort  is a rare opportunity for students,
              particularly undergraduates.  This is essentially a table top high energy
              experiment bringing all aspects, including physics and technical
Design,
              assembly and testing of detectors, layout and assembly of electronics, analysis
              of data  down to a manageable scale.  The remaining parts of the project,
              prototyping the detectors and data acquisition system, assembling and testing
              detectors, and analysis of data, would each make excellent senior theses or
              projects for graduate students.
