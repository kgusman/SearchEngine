Abstract    :
              The specifics of this project concern three directions which
arose out of a
              general interest in definable equivalence
relations. The first of these
              directions relates to the treeable
equivalence relations.  Following work of
              Adams and Kechris, we
know that there is a mass of countable Borel
              equivalence
relations which are mutually incomparable.  No such result
              is
known for the treeable Borel equivalence relations. We do not
know whether
              there are infinitely many distinct examples, and we
basically have only one
              established example which is not
hyperfinite. More generally we do not know
              whether the implicit
involvement of measure theoretic examples involving free
              actions
of the free group is the sole obstruction to hyperfiniteness.
              The
second direction of Hjorth's project concerns issues in the fine
study of
              Borel complexities of countable isomorphism types in the
topology of
              quantifier free logic, and may be connected with a
translation of some basic
              concepts from first order logic into a
quantifier free context. The third
              direction of the proposal is
to investigate some combinatorial questions, such
              as having a
model with a certain partition property for definable
              partitions,
for infinitary sentences, especially those arising as the
              Scott
sentence of some countable structure; this may be related to a
still
              open problem posed by Shelah in the 1970's on the Hanf
number up to the
              continuum for countably infinitary logic.

In very general terms, this
              project can be located inside the
branch of mathematics known as "descriptive
              set theory". This
area arose around the end of 19th century as part of an
              effort to
better understand the basic objects -- such as the real
              number
line, real valued functions, subsets of the reals, subsets or
regions
              of two dimensional and three dimensional space, the area
or volume of such
              subsets -- which appear in calculus, and which
are needed for applications in
              engineering, physics, and
differential equations. Descriptive set theory does
              not itself
actually address any of these eventual applications, but is
rather
              preoccupied with purely foundational issues. Following
Silver's theorem in the
              1970's, many descriptive set theorists
have become interested in equivalence
              relations on spaces such as
the real number line, or two dimensional space, or
              similar
classes of "topological spaces". The study of such
              equivalence
relations leads to quotient objects which arise by
              considering
the collection of all equivalence classes.  For instance if
              we
set two real numbers to be equivalent when the result of
subtracting one
              from the other is an integer (i.e. a "whole
number"), then the collection of
              equivalence classes may be
naturally identified with the result of basically
              wrapping the
real number line around itself, to obtain circle of
              circumference
one. In this simple example the quotient object is
              easily
understood, and has a geometrical representation.  Most of the
work in
              Hjorth's area deals with the so called "non-smooth"
equivalence relations
              whose quotient objects do not admit such a
representation, and the study of
              these quotient spaces is known
to have connections with a variety of
              mathematical disciplines,
such as "dynamics", and "ergodic theory", and some
              of the more
abstract branches of "analysis", such as "infinite
              dimensional
group representations".
