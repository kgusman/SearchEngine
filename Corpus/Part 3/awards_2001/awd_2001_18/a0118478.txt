Abstract    :
              This project will continuously monitor the pressure, fluid chemistry, and
              hydrology in two instrumented boreholes at the Costa Rica subduction zone,
              using long-term observatories (CORK and ACORK) installed during ODP Leg 203. 
              The field program will  1) deploy pressure gauges and data loggers,
              OsmoSamplers, and osmotic  flow meters in 3 CORKed boreholes along a transect
              across the deformation front of the subduction zone and 2) retrieve the
              OsmoSamplers, data stored in the data loggers and deploying new OsmoSamplers
              and pressure gauges, with the submersible Alvin.  The fluid stored in the
              OsmoSamplers will provide a continuous 1.3 year record of  fluid conditions 
              collected at in situ conditions at weekly resolution, in three distinct
              hydrogeologic systems. The first flow system is the upper oceanic crust of the
              incoming Cocos Plate, the second is the return of a deeply sourced fluid along
              the decollement and the third is in the underthrust sediment section driven by
              compaction dewatering.   By documenting the nature of these hydrogeologic
              systems it will be possible to better understand the effects of fluid flow at
              convergent margins on the shallow thermal structure and fluid content of the
              downgoing plate, the physical properties of the subduction zone interface,
              deformation style and transport of elements to the oceans.
