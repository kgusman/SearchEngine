Recent observations of a strong, apparently persistent, Agulhas
              Undercurrent (AUC) raise a multitude of provocative questions.  The big
              questions addressed by this study are 

What are the latitudinal extent of
              the AUC and its role in the thermohaline circulation?

What are the evolution
              and forcing of the velocity, potential vorticity, and water mass structure
              along the AUC path?

How does one quantify the mixing/entrainment with
              western boundary current waters and determine the absolute fluxes of heat and
              mass within the AUC?

What are the mean and temporal variability of the
              transport of the AUC?

A hydrographic cruise is proposed during which 4
              conductivity-temperature-depth and lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler
              sections of the AUC will be measured.  A short mooring array along 32S will be
              deployed, as well.  Three moorings will each contain 3 meters spaced to capture
              the AUC transport.  They will be confined to the lower 1000 m of the water
              column and be designed to monitor for up to 2 years, but may be retrieved
              earlier.  The dominant fluctuations are expected to have periods of 30 - 40
              days.  The moorings, meters, and associated technicians will be provided at no
              cost to NSF by Southampton Oceanography Centre.  A line of stations at 50 km
              spacing will connect the offshore ends of the sections closing boxes to allow
              property balance estimation to be done.  A line of stations at 100 km spacing
              will be made along 1800 m from 26S to 37S to estimate the latitudinal extent of
              the undercurrent.  Each station will include conductivity-temperature-depth,
              dissolved oxygen, and lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler data with 24
              bottles for calibration to WOCE standards by ODF personnel.  The cruise should
              require about 28 days.
