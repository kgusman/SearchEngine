This Americas Program thesis enhancement will support thesis
              dissertation research by  
Ms. Yasmina Katsulis under the supervision of Dr.
              Linda-Anne Rebhun of Yale University.  Dr. Gudelia Rangel of El Colegio de la
              Frontera Norte has agreed to act as field supervisor for the fieldwork in
              Mexico.  The aim of this project is to examine career trajectories among 300
              female commercial sex workers (FCSW's) in Tijuana, Mexico, and more
              specifically, the relationship between migration patterns, work sites and HIV
              risk.  In particular, the project will: (1) examine the relationship between
              migration and the various career trajectories of 300 FCSW's in Tijuana, Mexico;
              (2) measure their knowledge, attitudes, and practices for risk management in a
              variety of work sites; (3) examine how risk management is either complicated or
              facilitated by structural factors, most importantly female urban migration; (4)
              generate an epidemiological profile of HIV infection for the population in
              question.

Using integrated qualitative and quantitative methods, this
              research will help to provide a more comprehensive portrait of those aspects of
              human experience critical in determining health outcomes.  The findings will
              contribute to the literature on health beliefs in Latin America, the political
              economy of health, and the use of qualitative methods to address public health
              issues.
