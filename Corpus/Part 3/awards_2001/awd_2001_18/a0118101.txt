              Abstract of OCE-0118101; "Physical and Chemical constraints on fluxes at LExEn
              and proposed ODP sites in the Gulf of Mexico"

The proposed project will
              focus on unraveling the dynamics of the gas hydrate reservoir at and between
              moderate and high flux sites. Through 1.) direct measurement of fluid flux with
              osmotic flux meters, 2) acquisition of high resolution heat flow data, 3) use
              of porewater and solid-phase proxies for gas flux and 4) imaging of flux
              conduits with high-resolution, deep-tow Chirp profiles, the study will
              constrain spatial and temporal variations in fluxes critical to the formation
              and long-term stability of gas hydrates. The results provide a test of the
              hypothesis that quantifiable spatial variations in energy, fluid and gas flux
              are related to observable changes in the distribution of free gas and gas
              hydrate. The study sites coincide with two sites chosen for focused
              microbiological research as part of an NSF funded Life in Extreme Environments
              project. The study sites also coincide with two sites proposed for Gulf of
              Mexico gas hydrates drilling and the project will provide additional site
              survey data for the proposed drilling.
