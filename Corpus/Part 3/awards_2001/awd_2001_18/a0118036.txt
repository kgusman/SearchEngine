              ABSTRACT

OCE-0118036

In order to use either O2 or nitrogen for current or
              paleo isotopic studies of their respective marine cycles, it is imperative that
              we know their fractionation during sedimentary consumption and if possible
              determine the mechanisms.  A few estimates of O2 and NO3- isotope fractionation
              during sedimentary consumption have been made which showed that fractionation
              was much less (approaching zero) than the theoretical ones. Because these
              observations were made only in the eastern North Pacific where productivity is
              high and mid-water oxygen levels are low, two research investigators from the
              University of Washington and the University of Texas Marine Science Institute
              plan to carry out a laboratory methods development and field experimentation
              exercise to address two questions.  Question number one asks whether the near
              absence of isotopic fractionation observed for both oxygen consumption and
              denitrification in highly respiring sediments of the Pacific Northwest
              continental margin a ubiquitous characteristic of shelf and upper slope
              sediments.  The second question asks to what extent N2 production and the lack
              of N and O isotopic fractionation is related to abiotic or microbially mediated
              reoxidation of reduced products of metabolism.  The PIs will conduct a field
              program in the Gulf of Mexico to (1) measure oxidant isotopic fractionation of
              O2 and NO3-, as well as related species such as N2 and NH4+ in incubated
              sediments, both on deck and in-situ; (2) conduct on-deck core manipulation
              experiments with added substrates (NO3-, 15NO3-, HN4+, 15HN4+, organic material
              and reducing substances) and inhibitors to elucidate possible mechanisms of
              isotopic fractionation and (3) make porewater and benthic chamber measurements
              of diagenesis rates to help elucidate the processes responsible for
              fractionation or lack thereof.
