The Plata Basin comprises the Paraguay-Parana rivers system and the
              Uruguay river system; it is shared by Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and
              Uruguay.  This large and complex river system has high levels of biodiversity
              and human use, making it an ideal location to test a novel interdisciplinary,
              multi-stakeholder approach for studying the interaction of natural and human
              systems as well as for planning alternative strategies of sustainable
              development.  The Plata Basin pilot project will focus on the effects of
              expanding agricultural and cattle-raising activities on biogeochemical cycles,
              land-use change, levels of biodiversity, and the changing hydrological cycles
              of the Paraguay and Parana rivers.  Computer-based models, using variables
              reflecting land-use changes, socio-economic data, and climatic information,
              will be used to better understand the consequences of the flooding cycles of
              the Paraguay and Parana rivers in the next fifty years.

A two-session
              planning workshop will take place in Argentina in March 2002 to construct a
              research agenda for the Plata Basin.  The workshop will include key political,
              industrial, and local community stakeholders from the Plata Basin countries, as
              well as researchers from the region and the U.S.  The planning workshop will
              seek to assess the extent, rate, and impact of the expansion of the agrarian
              frontier in the Plata Basin.  It will also establish a long-term,
              interdisciplinary research agenda and will evaluate methods of incorporating
              stakeholder input into appropriate models.  A website, with the relevant papers
              and workshop outcomes will be posted by AAAS, and will include interactive
              functions to facilitate dialogue and data exchange between members of the
              scientific community interested in the interaction between natural and human
              systems. 

This project is an award emanating from the FY 2001 special
              competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of
              Coupled Natural and Human Systems.
