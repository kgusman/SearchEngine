Abstract    :
              On January 26, 2001 at 8:46 AM (local time), a magnitude Mw 7.5 earthquake
              struck the Kachchh area in Gujarat, India. This is the most damaging earthquake
              in India in the last 50 years. The earthquake epicenter is located to the north
              of Bacchau about 160 miles (250 km) west of Ahmadabad, India or about 180 miles
              (290 km) southeast of Hyderabad, Pakistan. The epicenter was at N23.399 E70.316
              and a depth of 23.6 km according to USGS. The earthquake damaged dams, ports
              and bridges, obliterated small villages in Gujarat, and caused damage to
              Ahmedabad, a large city 250 km away from the epicenter. 

As of 2 February
              2001, the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation of the Indian Government
              reported more than 15,000 dead as the result of the earthquake. There are
              reports of ten of thousands of collapsed and damaged buildings, and a great
              number of people homeless. The January 26, 2001 earthquake took place in the
              Kachchh region, and appears to be an intraplate event with similarities with
              the 1811-1812 New Madrid sequence, which struck New Madrid, Missouri from
              December through January 1811-1812. First reports indicate that damage in
              Western India extends over large areas, as was observed in New Madrid,
              Missouri. The extent of casualties and damage and the similarities with
              existing conditions in the United States of America required the immediate
              dispatch of a NSF reconnaissance geotechnical team to document the geotechnical
              and engineering geology/seismology features of this earthquake.

This project
              provides funding necessary for sending a small advanced reconnaissance team to
              the area damaged by the January 26, 2001, Bhuj, India earthquake, and for
              documenting the geotechnical, and engineering seismology features of the
              earthquake in as much detail as possible. The reconnaissance team will be sent
              to India as soon as the emergency rescue efforts have slowed down, and the
              means of transport have been reestablished. The advanced reconnaissance team
              will be coordinated by J.P. Bardet of the University of Southern California.
              The advanced reconnaissance team will be followed by a larger reconnaissance
              team coordinated by Raymond Seed of the University of California, Berkeley.
              This larger team will be supported by a separate SGER grant from the National
              Science Foundation. 

The proposed reconnaissance of this devastating
              earthquake is expected to yield useful information and data to understand the
              effects of large-scale intraplate events, and to apply those findings to the
              mitigation of similar earthquake hazards in mid-America.
