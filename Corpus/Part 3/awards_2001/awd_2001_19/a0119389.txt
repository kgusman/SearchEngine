WORKSHOP: ACL'2001 Student Research
              Workshop



This is funding to subsidize expenses of student participants
              in the Student Research Workshop organized in conjunction with the Association
              for Computational Linguistics Conference (ACL'2001), which will be held July
              6-11, 2001, in Toulouse, France.  The Association for Computational Linguistics
              (ACL) is the primary international organization in the field of natural
              language processing and language engineering, with two regional chapters,
              Europe (EACL) and North America (NAACL), of approximately equal size.   The
              Association's annual conference, which is the major international meeting in
              the field, has traditionally rotated between North America and Europe but was
              held last year for the first time in a Pacific Rim location (Hong Kong).  The
              ACL Student Workshop is an inexpensive yet highly effective means of
              encouraging young and upcoming computational linguists.   The intimate workshop
              format, in addition to affording student participants sufficient time to
              present their research (20 minutes) and receive feedback from a panel of
              established researchers in the field (15 minutes), encourages them to begin
              building a rapport with established researchers.   Through feedback from the
              panel and other student participants,  this nurturing effort will pay dividends
              by providing the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives and
              guidance on their work at a critical time in their research in this rapidly
              changing research field.
