Abstract    :
              A three-year funding period is being requested so that the PI can expand and
              modify his existing simulation code in order to relax key assumptions that were
              previously implemented only because of computational constraints.  His
              numerical simulations describing the interaction of small-scale gravity waves
              with minor species and related chemical processes in the mesopause region (90
              km altitude) are the most complete and realistic to date.  Quite apart from
              causing large, highly nonlinear oscillations in minor species number densities,
              the waves drive a large downward transport of minor species through the effects
              of dissipation.  In spite of the fact that the model simulates time-dependent
              interactions between dynamics and nonlinear chemistry, the model uses linear
              (versus nonlinear) dynamics and a very limited number (or incomplete set) of
              chemically active minor species.  These simplifications have been necessary in
              order to be able to run the code within a reasonable amount of time on
              stand-alone personal computers.  However, to gain a complete understanding of
              the interactions and in order to include both physical and chemical processes
              that are known to be important in this region of the atmosphere, these two
              idealizations will have to be relaxed.  This will increase the computational
              burden well beyond the limits of personal computers, requiring multiprocessor
              computers for faster, efficient computations.  The PI is thus proposing to
              purchase a relatively inexpensive "turn-key" multiprocessor machine to assist
              them in the in-house development and testing of code required to increase the
              level of realism in their model, and subsequently transfer the code to faster
              super-computers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The proposed
              work falls into the Applications in Science and Engineering (AP) section of the
              small class category of ITR proposals, and is most closely related to the
              Aeronomy Program of the Atmospheric Science Division within the Directorate for
              Geosciences.
