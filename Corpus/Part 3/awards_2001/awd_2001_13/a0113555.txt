Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research award under the Information Technology Research
              initiative.  The collaborator (DMR-0113172) is Professor L. Sun at the
              University of Iowa. The research involves the development and application of
              methods for large-scale dislocation dynamics simulations.

As a result of
              recent progress in manufacturing and engineering utilization of nano-and
              micro-scale structures, there is an urgent need for approaches that are capable
              of predicting the reliability and propensity of these structures to failure. 
              This grant will develop Fortran 90/95 parallel computer software, based on
              discrete dislocation dynamics, which will predict plastic deformation and
              failure of sub-micron semiconductor microelectronics.  Developed software will
              be aimed at (1) design of desired mechanical properties of semiconductor thin
              film-substrate material systems for optimum reliability; (2) development of new
              computer architectures for parallel, large-scale simulations for the dynamics
              of topologically complex line defects, which interact through long-range force
              fields; and (3) enhanced education training of graduate and undergraduate
              students. 

The following projects will be undertaken: (1) Investigation of
              single and collective dislocation interaction phenomena in anisotropic
              materials, which determine plasticity and failure in semiconductor devices; (2)
              Multiscale coupling of parametric dislocation dynamics with the finite element
              and analytical elasticity methods; (3) Development of unique software on
              parallel, scalable computer clusters to simulate the collective behavior of
              topologically complex line defects, which interact with a long-range force
              field; (4) Application of the developed software to investigate a number of
              critical physical mechanisms, including, misfit and threading dislocation loop
              motion; dislocation-dislocation interactions; junction and jog formation;
              dislocation annihilation and multiplication; dislocation interaction with grain
              boundaries, free surfaces and bimaterial elastic interfaces; dislocation
              interactions with point defects, precipitates and cracks; influence of thermal
              residual stress; computational design of buffer layers and superlattices;  and
              (5) Large-scale simulation and optimization of semiconductor systems to provide
              guidelines for engineering design of new generations of
              microelectronics.

The research will improve our understanding of plastic
              flow and failure at the nano-to-meso scale and represents a challenge to high
              performance computing and protocols.  Models will be compared to experimental
              data and will also be used to design reliable microelectronics.
