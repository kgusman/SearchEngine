Abstract    :
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some other common soil bacteria utilize a
              flagella-independent mode of movement called twitching motility (also called
              gliding motility). P. aeruginosa is an excellent model organism in which to
              study this form of motility due to its advanced genetics and newly completed
              genome sequence database. In twitching motility, bacteria use fibrous polar
              appendages (type 4 pili) to move across a surface. It is thought that the basis
              of this movement is the extension and retraction of these pili. Twitching
              motility may be assayed by stab-inoculation of an agar plate and then
              observation of spreading growth of the bacteria at the plate-agar interface.
              Dr. Cynthia Whitchurch, a collaborator on this project, has performed video
              microscopy of P. aeruginosa twitching motility. This may be viewed at
              http://www.cmcb.uq.edu.au/cmcb/PUBS/twitch.html.  Twitching motility is highly
              complex and involves dozens of genes at different chromosomal loci. Although
              many genes required for twitching have been identified, an understanding of the
              mechanism and regulation of twitching motility is elusive. A gene first
              identified as a regulator required for alginate production, algZ, is required
              for twitching motility. algZ encodes a ribbon-helix-helix DNA binding protein
              that was first identified and cloned by the principle investigator. The
              deletion of algZ in an environmental P. aeruginosa isolate results in a loss of
              twitching motility. The goal of this project is to define the role of algZ in
              twitching motility. These studies will define the phenotype of the algZ
              deletion strain. The strain will be analyzed to determine whether the defect
              appears to be in pili expression, processing, export, or function. Electron
              microscopy, whole cell ELISA, phage sensitivity, and video microscopy will be
              used. Biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches will identify genes that are
              candidates for algZ-dependence and involvement in twitching motility. The
              biochemical approach involves a modified SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands
              by exponential enrichment) technique utilizing purified AlgZ and genomic DNA. A
              transposable promoter probe in an algZ-inducible strain is used in the genetic
              approach. The genomic approach involves the determination of the consensus for
              AlgZ binding to DNA (via DNA footprinting and mutagenesis) and then
              interrogation of the P. aeruginosa genome database for possible AlgZ targets.
              The candidate gene(s) will then be tested to confirm algZ-dependence by
              construction of a candidate gene fusion(s) in an algZ inducible strain. The
              expression of the candidate gene(s) may then be monitored in response to algZ
              induction.  Lastly, studies will be undertaken in which the expression or
              interruption of a candidate gene(s) (or some combination of these) will be able
              to restore the algZ deletion strain to a twitching phenotype. This will confirm
              that all algZ-dependent genes involved in twitching motility have been
              identified. These studies will elucidate the genetic control of twitching
              motility. Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of these
              studies. This will not only increase current knowledge regarding the coordinate
              regulation of alginate production and twitching motility, but also the ways to
              better use and control environmental bacteria with regard to bioremediation.
