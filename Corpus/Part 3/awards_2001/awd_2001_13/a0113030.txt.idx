Abstract    :
              Current computing systems do not support human work effectively.  They restrict
              human-computer interaction to one mode at a time (through a keyboard or a
              mouse) and are designed with an assumption that use will be by individuals
              (rather than groups), directing (rather than interacting) with the system.  To
              support the ways in which humans work and interact, a new paradigm for
              computing is required that is multimodal, rather than unimodal, collaborative,
              rather than personal, and dialogue-enabled, rather than unidirectional.  This
              research will develop principles for, implement, and assess natural,
              multimodal, multiuser, dialogue-enabled interfaces to geographic information
              systems (GIS) that make use of large-screen displays and virtual environment
              technology.  These interfaces will support a two-way iterative dialogue between
              human and machine in which the human participant can use three modalities,
              speech, gesture, and gaze, in natural ways.  Progress toward multimodal
              human-computer interfaces will require both an understanding of individual
              modalities and the fusion of information at various levels.  The project is
              concerned, specifically, with the use of computer vision and speech processing
              as a means of interpreting and integrating information from spoken words, free
              hand gestures and gaze.  It is also concerned with how to enable a
              human-computer dialogue with an interactive, multi-layered map in the context
              of a GIS and with how to enable map-mediated dialogue between human
              collaborators.  The work will be bootstrapped through use of an existing
              test-bed that integrates gesture and speech for simple map queries.  The
              research will investigate how characteristics of tasks, information, and users
              influence the nature of human-computer and computer-mediated human-human
              dialogue.  In doing so, the research will determine how these factors influence
              the strategies required to achieve an effective easy-to-use interface that
              supports information access and productive work by individuals and
              groups.  This research will advance the science of natural, multimodal
              human-computer interaction, while addressing, directly, the challenges of
              developing new knowledge through which advances in information technology can
              enable universal participation in geospatial information access and
              applications.  Estimates suggest that as much as 80% of all digital data
              contain some form of georeferencing (coordinates, addresses, zip codes).  As a
              result, GIS have become an important tool for managing and analyzing data
              across a range of science, policy analysis, resource management, business
              planning, and educational applications.  In spite of the potential applications
              for GIS and the growing availability of geospatial data, GIS are underutilized
              because current systems are hard to use.  There is a substantial gap between
              current GIS applications and the promise of GIS to facilitate public access to
              the large volume of geospatial information and to support public as well as
              expert input to important decisions affecting their communities and
              environments.  Achieving the research goals outlined will, thus, enable more
              effective decision-making about risks to public safety and health and will
              support input to important public decisions by a wider range of participants.
