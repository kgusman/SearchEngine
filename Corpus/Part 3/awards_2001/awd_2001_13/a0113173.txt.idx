Abstract    :
              LTREB: Linking Individual and Spatial Variation to Demography and Population
              Dynamics of a Neotropical Parrot  Steven R. Beissinger  This long-term
              research project will continue studies of a South American parrot, the
              Green-rumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), to address marked variation among
              individuals and across small distances in behavior, demography and population
              dynamics.  Continued long-term studies, which have been conducted since in
              Venezuela since 1988, will link social system, dispersal and demography to
              population dynamics.  Thirteen years of similar work has revealed a complex
              social system dominated by large numbers of nonbreeding males which occur in
              various social groupings, a low rate extra-pair fertilizations that are often
              assigned to males residing far from the nesting pair, and unusual spatial
              variation in the onset of breeding between two populations (upland and lowland)
              located only 500 m apart and differing in elevation by 1-2 meters.  They have
              also found different patterns of population growth in the two populations that
              can be attributed to: (1) higher reproductive success in the upland population,
              (2) young females dispersing much farther than males, often leaving the study
              area altogether, and (3) young males dispersing from the poorer quality lowland
              habitat to the better quality upland habitat.  Specific objectives of the
              study are to: (1) determine movement patterns and affiliations of breeders and
              nonbreeders, and dispersal of young to understand how they might account for
              extra-pair parentage patterns, small-scale variation in the onset of breeding,
              and differences among the sexes and populations; (2) document annual variation
              in the onset of breeding among populations of parrotlets that occurs at small
              spatial scales and measure food availability to see how this affects timing of
              laying; and (3) understand the effects of the individual and spatial
              differences in demography and population dynamics by developing population
              models that integrate behavior with sexual- and habitat-related differences in
              demography.  Study goals will be accomplished by expanding the number of
              parrotlet populations under study; using radio-telemetry to track the daily
              movements and interactions of breeding pairs and nonbreeding males; and
              continuing behavioral, demographic and environmental monitoring to refine our
              understanding of the social system and to estimate vital rates.
