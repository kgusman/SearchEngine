Abstract    :
              Abstract Zhang 0113618 Korf 0113313  Best-First Search Algorithms for
              Sequence Alignment Problems in Computational Biology  Molecular biologists
              are currently faced with very challenging computational problems.  For example,
              a draft of the human genome has been completed, a sequence of about three
              billion base pairs.  A draft of the mouse genome soon will be completed.  We
              know that mice and men share over 90% of their genetic material.  What we don't
              know is exactly which parts of the human and mouse genomes are common to both
              species.  This information can be used to identify human genes, and to
              translate results from mouse studies to studies of human health and disease. 
              The problem of identifying the common elements between these two DNA sequences
              is an example of sequence alignment, which is a computational problem.  Other
              examples of sequence alignment problems include gene identification, and RNA
              and protean structure prediction.  Current computer algorithms are either too
              slow, or require too much memory, to directly solve a problem as large as the
              human-mouse genomic sequence alignment.  We propose to develop new algorithms
              for various sequence-alignment problems, based on heuristic search algorithms
              in artificial intelligence.  Our goal is to provide much more efficient
              sequence-alignment algorithms for use by molecular biologists.
