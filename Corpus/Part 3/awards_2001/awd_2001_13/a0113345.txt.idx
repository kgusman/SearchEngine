Abstract    :
              0113345 Buseck  This grant provides partial salary support for an electron
              microscopist who will help maximize the geological, mineralogical, and
              geochemical capabilities of two TEMs that will be installed in 2001 within the
              ASU Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy.  These instruments were
              obtained to develop new techniques and measurements in materials science and
              physics, and the goal of the new position is to become familiar with those
              techniques and adapt them for research in the geological sciences. One of the
              instruments will have an electron beam that can be made less than 0. 2 nm in
              diameter. We will use this capability to analyze grain boundaries, dislocation
              cores, and surface layers on the atomic scale and will obtain crystallographic
              data from within unit cells through electron nanodiffraction. The other
              instrument will contain a Gatan imaging filter for measurements that will allow
              elemental mapping on the sub-nanometer scale. It will also have an
              environmental cell for studies under controlled atmospheres. This cell will
              maintain a relatively high gas pressure of up to 50 torr in the sample chamber,
              while retaining the high-resolution capabilities of the TEM. Specimen heating
              and dynamic image recording will allow chemical reactions to be followed at
              close to the atomic scale. We will use this to study minerals that are unstable
              in the vacuum of the electron microscopes.  These include clay minerals, the
              green rusts, gypsum and related hydrated sulfates as well as dehydroxylation
              reactions and valence changes in minerals. ***
