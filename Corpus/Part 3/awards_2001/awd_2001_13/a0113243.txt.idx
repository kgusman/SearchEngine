Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to discover the universal character of reading and
              the specific ways that writing systems affect reading processes.  It will focus
              on the comparison of two highly contrastive writing systems, i.e., English,
              representative of the world's alphabetic writing systems, and Chinese, usually
              considered to be a unique logographic system.  Alphabetic systems use
              meaningless graphs (letters) as the basic unit in the system and map these
              units onto meaningless units in the spoken language (phonemes).  Thus, the
              letter b maps to the sound /b/.  In Chinese, there are no units in the writing
              system that correspond to phonemes. Instead, the basic graphs (characters)
              correspond to syllables, most of which are words.  This allows written Chinese
              to link graphic units directly with meaning.  Along with the fact that early
              Chinese characters had pictographic content, this fact has encouraged the
              hypothesis that Chinese reading occurs without reference to speech (phonology).
               However, recent research, including Perfetti's current NSF-funded research,
              has discovered that readers of Chinese make use of spoken word forms, just as
              readers of alphabetic systems do.  In a wide variety of tasks that expose
              processes of word identification, Chinese readers use the pronunciations in
              silent reading.  For example, when readers make decisions about word meanings,
              the pronunciation of the words interferes with the meaning judgment.  To use an
              English example, a reader who is asked to decide whether an item is a kind of
              plant, may make a mistake on the word "flour" (or take longer to make a
              decision) because the word shares a pronunciation with a word that is a kind of
              plant ("flower").  If the reader could avoid the pronunciation, such an effect
              would not occur.  Similar results have now been found for Chinese, suggesting
              that reading for meaning in both Chinese and English involves activation of
              pronunciations.  Now the question becomes how the rapid events of word
              identification unfold in a fraction of a second from graphic input to
              pronunciation and meaning.  What differences and similarities occur across the
              two writing systems?  Are there differences in their visual processing demands?
               In the route from graphic form to meaning?  These questions will be addressed
              in studies of Event Related Potentials (ERP), the electrical activity of the
              brain that can provide information about the time course of word reading
              events.  The project will also include fMRI studies to add more specific
              information about underlying brain structures used in reading Chinese compared
              with those used in reading English.  In addition, the project will study the
              important question of how a learner comes to acquire reading skill in a second
              writing system.  American students learning to read Chinese will be studied in
              a range of behavioral and ERP tasks that will provide information on the course
              of learning and on some of the brain activities associated with this new
              learning.
