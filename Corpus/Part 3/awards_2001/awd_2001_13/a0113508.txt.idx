Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the creation of a stochastic representation for the
              phase-space embeddings of dynamical systems, for application to the task of
              speech classification and recognition.  The research team will develop a
              general stochastic model for such signal embeddings, test the model through
              classification simulations, then apply the technique to both isolated and
              continuous speech recognition.  The goal of the research is to discover
              time-domain analysis techniques using dynamical systems methods that will lead
              to improved analysis of speech signals and to improvements in speech
              recognition accuracy.  This approach represents the integration of two
              traditionally distinct research fields: statistical signal processing and
              chaotic systems.  Since signal processing is fundamentally based on linear
              systems theory and the study of chaos is inherently non-linear, these fields
              have little or no overlap outside of the fact that both attempt to model the
              behavior of physical systems.  This research integrates these very different
              viewpoints by applying stochastic analysis and modeling tools from the signal
              processing field to the problem of analyzing embedded phase spaces obtained
              from chaotic systems analysis of time-series signals.   The results will lead
              to a significant gain in our fundamental understanding of the characteristics
              and analysis of speech signals, with potential long-term application to other
              areas of speech processing such as speech coding and synthesis.  The impact of
              developing these new technologies and applying them to the speech recognition
              task extends into both the machine learning and signal processing communities; 
              specifically, the development of time-domain characterization methods is
              directly applicable to many problems of interest in the chaos and non-linear
              modeling domain, and will demonstrate an ability to concretely measure
              differences between the phase-space attractors of chaotic systems.
