Abstract    :
              A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile autonomous system of
              nodes connected by wireless links with multi-hop communication and no
              underlying infrastructure. Research in the field of MANET is receiving
              unprecedented attention due to their profound impact on human life. The
              most important problems in MANET are Routing, Quality of Service, Security,
              Power management and Traffic and Mobility modeling and we plan to address many
              of these issues. In a MANET, when a mobile node has a packet to send, it first
              consults its route cache to determine whether it already has a route to
              destination, else it initiates route discovery by broadcasting. Once a
              route is established, its continuation and maintenance is of prime concern for
              efficient communication. A route could be broken by mobility and is determined
              by route error packets. Rather than employing a conventional way of global
              re-flooding for a new route search, we address this by Local Route
              Repair (LLR) approach and achieve re-connectivity with minimum overhead.
              Further work is needed to extend our scheme by increasing the length of
              patch-up part. We expect this to yield a higher amount of savings in terms of
              routing overhead and delay when unidirectional links are present. We also plan
              to define an analytical framework for different protocols and determine their
              performance. The need for scheduling in a MANET arises primarily due to
              limited availability of resources. We plan to study the impact of packet level
              scheduling strategies that transmit packets based on a metric derived from
              characteristics of the data being transmitted, like the length of the packets
              or the length of the route being traversed by the packets or even the priority
              of the packets. We plan to test other routing schemes and define and formulate
              an analytical model for packet queue at each node so that we could
              determine end-to-end delay of different types of packets. Effective operation
              of MANETs is dependent on maintaining appropriate routing information in
              a distributed fashion. Confidentiality of routing information is important so
              that not only the payload data but also the routing message headers carrying,
              the location information of the mobile nodes can be exchanged securely. We
              have defined an authentication scheme that can prevent the external attacks.
              We minimize substantial overhead by performing mutual authentication using
              challenge-response mechanism along the reply path only when the route reply is
              received. We plan to propose a distributed intrusion detection system to
              handle them. We will build these systems based on traffic profiles that we
              would obtain after extensive study of the traffic patterns. We are planning to
              perform a detailed simulation to obtain metrics that would help us in
              differentiating valid and malicious data. Wireless sensor networks can be
              easily deployed without any installation costs or pre-planned organization. To
              increase fault tolerance, thousands of these sensors might be employed. The
              traditional routing protocols defined for wireless ad hoc network do not scale
              well for sensor networks as they are data centric and application-specific
              unlike traditional networks. Most protocols for sensor network collect data
              periodically from environment. We feel that there exists a need for networks
              geared towards responding immediately to changes in the sensed attributes.
              Very recently, we have proposed a protocol called TEEN for such networks. We
              are also looking at ways to combine the best features of both proactive and
              reactive protocols to form a hybrid network. We also believe that sensor
              networks should provide the end user with the ability to control the three-way
              trade-off between energy efficiency, accuracy and response time dynamically.
              In brief, the proposal research will have a long-term impact on the robustness
              and security of MANETs and sensor networks.
