Abstract    :
              This award is the result of a proposal submitted to the Information Technology
              Research initiative.  The goal of the research is to develop a scalable
              software infrastructure for large multiscale simulations on a Grid of
              geographically distributed, massively parallel supercomputers, as well as on
              future Petaflop computers.  The multiscale simulation approach will combine,
              in a single Grid software, finite element (FE) calculation, the coarse-grained
              molecular dynamics (CGMD), molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and quantum
              mechanical (QM) calculation based on the density functional theory (DFT). 
              Continuum mechanics calculation based on the FE method will be performed with
              constitutive relations derived from the CGMD method in conjunction with MD
              simulations, which in turn will embed QM algorithm described by the DFT.  The
              following will be developed:  (1) Grid-based FE/CGMD/MD/QM algorithms based on
              space-time multiresolution algorithms implemented with hierarchical
              decomposition on parallel/distributed computers for scalability and
              constrained-dynamics-based hybridization for seamless coupling of the hybrid
              simulation componets; (2) Space-time partitioned multiscale simulation combined
              with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) and parallel replica methods to couple disparate
              length and time scales; (3) Grid-computation tools including adaptive load
              balancing using wavelet-based computational-space decomposition and
              space-filling-curve-based adaptive data compression to reduce communication and
              storage; (4) Immersive and interactive visualization of the large simulation
              data using octree-based visibility culling and parallel/distributed
              preprocessing of the visualization data with machine-learning predictive
              prefetch.  The Gridified software will be used to study nanosystems of great
              importance to future information processing.  Multiscale simulations involving
              1,000 - 10,000 QM atoms and 100 million - 1 billion MD atoms will be performed
              to study atomistically-induced phenomena, with emphasis on environmental
              effects where chemical processes play an important role.  The multiscale
              algorithm will relate the atomistic processes to experimentally observable
              quantities, by covering an order-of-magnitude larger length scale (10 micron)
              through continuum mechanics and extending time scales through the KMC and
              replica methods.  The simulations will focus on stress domains and their phonon
              imaging in Si/Si3N4 and GaAs/Si3N4 nanopixels for sub-0.1 micron
              microelectronics applications and oxidation effects on them, and on
              substrate-encoded self-organized growth of lattice-mismatched semiconductor
              quantum dots (GaAs/InAs).   The project will involve close collaborations
              with scientists at government laboratories (Argonne, NASA Ames, Sandia, Naval
              Oceanographic Office), industry (Intel, Motorola) and universities, as well as
              international collaborations in Europe, Japan and South America. %%%
