Abstract    :
                This project develops a new technique for estimation of the state of a
              stochastic dynamical system, given some partial and imperfect information from
              measurements.  Unlike traditional linear estimation methods, such as
              least-squares variational methods or Kalman Filter approach, this new technique
              is capable of handling highly nonlinear dynamics--and thus non-Gaussian
              statistics-- in a way that approaches the optimality of the formally exact
              solution by Kushner, Stratonovitch, Pardoux (KSP).  Just as KSP, the new method
              computes the conditional statistics of the system given the measurements. 
              However, when applied to problems of interest in information technology, such
              as large-scale geoscience or environmental data assimilation, the new method
              does not lead to functional stochastic equations that are hopelessly
              intractable to solve, as does KSP.  The approach pursued in this project is
              instead to approximate the conditional statistics by means of a variational
              formulation, which yields the conditional mean as the minimizer of an
              appropriate cost function and the covariance as its Hessian.  The cost function
              proposed is calculated by a Rayleigh-Ritz or moment-closure scheme, which
              should render the problem tractable to numerical computation.  The main
              research that will be done is to develop suitable statistical techniques to
              model the system for the Rayleigh-Ritz calculation, to work out efficient
              algorithms for the numerical optimization of the cost function, and to compare
              with existing suboptimal estimation schemes.      In many areas of the
              geosciences of practical importance, it is crucial to combine information from
              observations with the results of a sophisticated numerical model to produce the
              best estimate of the past or future state of the system. In the case of a
              chemical or radioactive spill observed by monitoring a few well sites, one
              wants to track the contaminant plume backward in time to its source.  This must
              be accomplished with only statistical knowledge about the properties of the
              aquifer and groundwater flow field and with the measurements themselves subject
              to error. In numerical weather prediction, the goal is instead to combine the
              latest observations from satellite arrays with the output of large-scale,
              meteorological computer models to predict the future state of the weather. 
              Again, the models contain stochastic or chaotic elements which prevent perfect
              prediction based upon partial and imperfect information.  The modeling methods
              and numerical algorithms developed in this project should provide a practical
              scheme to compute the best estimate in the face of such randomness in the model
              and uncertainty in the observations.
