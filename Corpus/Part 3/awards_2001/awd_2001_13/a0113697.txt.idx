              Cell Interaction-dependent Neural Development PI: Paul J.
              Linser Abstract  Complex tissues such as the nervous system are composed of
              numerous distinct types of cells that work together to produce the net output
              of that tissue. Two major sub-categories of cells in the nervous system are
              neurons and neuroglia. These are highly specialized cell types that perform
              complementary but distinctly different tasks. How it is that these disparate
              cell types arise during embryonic development is a central focus of the
              research in the laboratory of Professor Paul J. Linser. During the course of
              over 20 years of research into the mechanisms that influence an embryonic
              cell's choice to become either a neuron or a neurglial cell, Dr. Linser's group
              discovered a cell surface glycoprotein that seems to participate in this
              developmental decision. The protein is called 5A11/basigin and is found in
              several tissues but is very highly expressed in neural retina and brain. A line
              of mice has been produced in which the gene for 5A11/basigin has been
              inactivated. These mice afford a remarkable opportunity for studying the actual
              function of this protein. Among the abnormalities exhibited by the 5A11/basigin
              knockout mice is blindness. Although the neural retinas of these mice initially
              appear to develop normally, they never actually become functional as receivers
              and interpreters of image (light) signals. The focus of Dr. Linser's research
              is on the use of the knockout mouse to help understand the specific role that
              5A11/basigin plays in the development of a normal and functioning neural
              retina. The proposed studies will combine techniques of molecular biology and
              biochemistry to examine in great detail the developmental changes that have
              arisen in the absence of the 5A11/basigin protein. As this protein is expressed
              in numerous tissues, the knockout mice also exhibit a number of other
              characteristics that greatly diminish their biological stability. Understanding
              the function of the 5A11/basigin glycoprotein in the neural retina will lead to
              fundamental insights into how this protein and others with similar structure
              serve in normal animal development.
