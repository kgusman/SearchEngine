Abstract    :
              0113168 Carletta  The speed of data processing is often of critical
              importance in real-time control systems. The required complexity of the
              real-time computations increases with the complexity of the control system
              model and the sophistication of the control algorithm. In addition, the
              sampling interval (i.e., the length of time within which the computation must
              be completed) decreases as the control system bandwidth increases. Thus, a
              complex, high-performance control system may require high-speed computational
              hardware. Currently, digital control systems universally rely on
              general-purpose microprocessors or digital signal processing (DSP) chips to
              compute appropriate control inputs from available sensor data. In some
              applications, the limits of the control system performance are determined by
              the speed of the processor used.  A possible alternative means of
              implementing a feedback control algorithm would use the field programmable gate
              array. Recent advances in field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology have
              completely changed the application area for these inexpensive, off-the-shelf,
              reconfigurable hardware devices. Once relegated to small "glue logic"
              applications, FPGAs are now capable of implementing complex very large scale
              integrated (VLSI) systems. Generally, FPGA implementations can now provide an
              order of magnitude faster execution time than microprocessor-based
              implementations, without incurring the high cost of fabrication and development
              required for application specific integrated circuits. As yet, the potential
              for improved control system performance that FPGAs may allow has not been
              exploited or explored.  This proposal describes work aimed at starting
              collaborative, interdisciplinary research in hardware implementation for
              real-time controls. It seeks to investigate the role that reconfigurable
              computing can play in control systems. This work aims to exploit reconfigurable
              computing based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology to provide
              faster hardware, so that more sophisticated and higher bandwidth real-time
              control systems may be implemented. First, novel FPGA synthesis methods will be
              developed for the implementation of general adaptive FIR filters. Such filters
              are the central elements in digital control systems, and in many non-control
              applications as well. Adaptive filters are chosen so as to exploit the capacity
              for run-time reconfiguration of the FPGA hardware. Second, to demonstrate the
              new synthesis methods, the FPGAs will be used to implement a stabilizing
              feedback control on a magnetic-bearing test rig. Magnetic suspension is an
              important and interesting control application in its own right, and will
              provide a suitable benchmark for FPGA implementation. The new FPGA-based
              control will be compared with a standard DSP-based control to demonstrate the
              achievable performance gains. The project will train two graduate students, and
              is amenable to undergraduate participation. When fully developed, the
              FPGA-controlled magnetic suspension system will serve as the basis for
              undergraduate laboratory exercises in classes on control and digital design.
