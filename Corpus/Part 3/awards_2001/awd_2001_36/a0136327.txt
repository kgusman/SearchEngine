              0136327/Haine

In an effort to understand some of the oceanic processes that
              may be involved in decadal climate variability, this project will apply adjoint
              sensitivity analysis to 1-degree models of the N. Atlantic Ocean circulation to
              look at mechanisms that control sea-surface temperature (SST).   The behavior
              of the 1-degree model will also be compared to forward integrations with
              1/3-degree and 1/6-degree models in order to investigate the importance of
              unpredictable internal processes such as transport by mesoscale eddies.  
              

The adjoint study will be used to determine the sensitivity of SST to prior
              surface forcing.  One of the hypotheses underlying this work is that changes to
              surface forcing can lead to changes in the depth of the thermocline which
              subsequently propagate through the ocean on baroclinic time scales and which
              may affect the SST above them in subsequent years.   The work will be based on
              a z-coordinate ocean circulation model developed at MIT.   The approach
              involves first conducting a 50-year hind-cast experiment for 1950-2000 with a
              1-degree resolution version of the model.  The fidelity of this will be
              assessed by comparing model SST with COADS SST.  Three sets of 20-year long
              adjoint sensitivity calculations will then be made using the a linearization of
              the model system around the fiducial trajectory given by the hind-cast run. 
              The three adjoint calculations will correspond to during different phases of
              the NAO -- low - early 60s, high - early  90s, near zero - mid-70s.   The
              variable whose sensitivity will be examined will be the end-of-winter SST
              spatially averaged over O(10,000 Km^2) regions of the ocean surface.   Model
              calculations will be performed on a Beowulf cluster at JHU and at one of the
              national supercomputing centers.
