Abstract    :
              Colicin E3 is a toxic protein secreted by certain strains of E. coli in order to
              eliminate related strains of bacteria living in the same ecological niche.
              Colicin E3 carries out three functions: it binds to the BtuB receptor on the
              target cell envelope, it is internalized into sensitive cells across their
              cytoplasmic membrane, and once inside the cell, it inactivates the protein
              biosynthetic machinery of the infected cell by nicking 16S ribosomal RNA
              between A1493 and G1494 at the ribosomal A site. The producing organism is
              immune to the toxicity of colicin E3 by virtue of an "immunity protein" (IP),
              which tightly binds to colicin E3 in a 1:1 complex, and thus renders it
              inactive. 

The goal of this project is to understand the interaction of
              colicin E3 with proteins that facilitate its translocation across the outer and
              inner membranes of E. coli. The research will focus on the crystal structure
              determination of three ternary complexes: (i) colicin E3, IP and a C-terminal
              fragment of TolA;  (ii) colicin E3, IP and TolB; (iii) colicin E3, IP and the
              BtuB cell surface receptor. Another part of this work deals with the dynamic
              aspects of the colicin E3 structure by itself and in the presence of either IP
              or the Tol proteins or the BtuB receptor. The degree of flexibility, either
              segmental or global, will be measured by Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET).
              The crystal structure of the colicin E3-IP binary complex suggests the
              formation of flexible hinges at the domain junctions in the absence of IP. This
              will be tested by FRET experiments. These studies will shed light on the
              mechanism of action of this multifunctional protein.
