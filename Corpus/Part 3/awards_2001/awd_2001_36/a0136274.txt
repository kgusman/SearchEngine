This three-year research project studies how people develop
              from youth to aged in the traditional foraging and simple horticultural society
              of the Tsimane, in Bolivia. The investigators will test predictions about
              age-specific patterns of mortality, morbidity, functional status, skill,
              strength and endurance focusing on the aging process and the elderly; will test
              hypotheses about the attainments of social skills and social capital as well as
              physical growth and strength as constraints on maturation and reproduction; and
              will study the relation between life history characteristics of individuals and
              the pattern of resource flows within and among families.  The researchers
              include two senior cultural anthropologists and five graduate and undergraduate
              students from the University of New Mexico and UC-Santa Barbara. The study
              sample will include ten Tsimane villages with a population of about 1,000
              individuals.  From the larger sample three villages with a total population of
              about 250 persons will be selected as a core sample for focused behavioral
              studies and monitoring. Various measures of mortality, morbidity,
              anthropometry, strength, and skills will be recorded as well as measures of
              time allocation, resource production and food distribution, childrearing
              skills, social status, and human and social capital. The data from this project
              will be important to a wide range of scholars interested in understanding the
              universal and variable features of human life histories under relatively
              traditional conditions, comparable to those prevailing during the long history
              of selection during which the human life course evolved.
