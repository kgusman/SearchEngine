Abstract    :
              The goal of this PFSMETE Start-Up Grant proposal is to establish a Partnership
              Laboratory within the framework of the UCSF SEP that will make discoveries and
              build knowledge about how collaborations between the scientific and education
              communities can improve and articulate K-20+ science education. This
              Partnership Laboratory will not be a separate, independent entity, but rather a
              scholarly research and evaluation effort integrated with SEP's existing
              professional development and partnership programs in science education, thereby
              institutionalizing partnership research efforts. The two major goals of
              establishing a Partnership Laboratory are: To build knowledge of
              scientist-teacher partnership by expanding and transforming PFSMETE-initiated
              partnership research by I) analyzing the correlation between scientist- teacher
              partnership outcomes and different programmatic models of partnership, 2)
              beginning an investigation of K-12 student outcomes that result from
              scientist-teacher partnerships, and 3) examining the influence of partnership
              experiences on the career trajectories of scientists and teachers.  To
              cultivate a partnership research community by 1) founding a Partnership
              Collaborative Inquiry Group of veteran SEP scientists and teachers who engage
              in on-going partnership action research, 2) involving scholars and
              practitioners from the fields of science and education research as Partnership
              Research Advisors, and 3) convening Partnership Collaborative Inquiry Group
              members, Partnership Research Advisors, and the SEP Staff semi- annually at
              Research Retreats to analyze research questions, methodological strategies,
              data analysis, and interpretation of fmdings. The effort will not only result
              in the establishment of a Partnership Laboratory, but also begin to build an
              academic discipline ofK-20+ Education Partnership, the study of collaboration
              between teachers and practitioners to increase the quality and authenticity of
              subject area education for all students. In addition, although the proposed
              efforts are focused on science education partnerships specifically, they have
              the potential for informing and promoting the development of partnerships in
              many disciplines. As such, these studies of scientist-teacher partnership will
              be of national interest, and documentation of these efforts and synthesis of
              fmdings will be disseminated through presentation at scientific and educational
              conferences, with the eventual goal of publication in journal articles and
              compilation into a partnership handbook.
