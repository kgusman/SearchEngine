Traditional social
              movement theory has emphasized the importance of political opportunity and
              collective identity for social movement formation, and for movement stability,
              longevity, and success. Recent work incorporates aspects of both into a single
              framework, highlighting the central role of social movement culture in
              simultaneously fostering 1) group identity, 2) an alternative interpretational
              frame of cause and effect, and 3) a sense of political efficacy among potential
              movement participants. Little empirical attention, however, has been devoted to
              examining the role media may play in forging movement culture across geographic
              space. 

The PIs will examine the largest labor mobilization in U.S. history
              --the southern textile strike campaigns of 1929-1934, where upwards of 400,000
              workers walked off their jobs --and the extent to which media (and radio
              specifically) played a vital role in fostering a cohesive social movement
              culture across rural, mill communities. Indeed, the worker mobilization that
              occurred remains an anomaly to social movement theorists and labor researchers,
              given the lack of union involvement and the geographically disbursed nature of
              mill towns during the time period in question.  Specifically, the project will
              investigate following: 1). Was there an empirical correspondence between radio
              station foundings during the era in question and strike events, even
              controlling for other influential factors? 2). What were transmission ranges at
              the time and to what extent were they heard in and across mill towns? Who owned
              these stations, and was there autonomy in terms of what could be broadcast?
              And, did mill workers have radios? 3). What national, regional, and state-level
              political information was transmitted that may have had the consequence of
              altering worker perceptions of political opportunity? 4). What was the role of
              radio in forging, or at least opening opportunity to, oppositional cultural
              messages. Were solidarity and a sense of similarity across mill towns
              manifested as a consequence? 

The project will make important contributions
              to theoretical debates regarding movement formation, communication technology,
              cultural transmission, labor dynamics, and spatial diffusion processes most
              generally.  The analyses will be embedded in a historical context, while
              simultaneously highlighting broader themes and debates pertaining to the study
              and understanding of media, social movements, labor, and culture.
