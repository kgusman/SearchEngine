              ABSTRACT

The ocean is second
              only to the atmosphere as a sink for anthropogenic CO2.  Over the last decade,
              our ability to quantify the oceanic sink using observations has dramatically
              increased.  The improvement derives from two major factors.  The first is the
              JGOFS/WOCE/OACES global ocean carbon survey, which produced the first
              high-quality, global-scale inorganic carbon data set.  The second is the
              continuing development of improved techniques to estimate anthropogenic carbon
              from new measurements.  Still, significant uncertainties remain regarding
              estimation of the spatial distribution of anthropogenic CO2 uptake and storage
              in the sea.  This uncertainty derives from the fact that the task of
              unambiguously discerning the natural and anthropogenic CO2 signals is far from
              trivial.  The estimates require assumptions that are difficult to verify and
              whose uncertainties are hard to estimate.  Better quantification of the spatial
              storage pattern and the associated uncertainties is required to assess the
              value of oceanic data constraints on the global carbon budget and ocean model
              evaluations,  such as those undertaken by the Ocean Carbon-cycle Model
              Intercomparison Project (OCMIP).  

On this project, a team of researchers
              from the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Washington,
              and Princeton University will perform global analysis of observation-based
              estimates of the oceanic storage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.  Their goal
              is to assess a range of ocean data to provide a well-constrained estimate of
              the oceanic anthropogenic CO2 distribution.  Particular emphasis will be placed
              on the estimation of uncertainties and differences between the several
              approaches.  This work would depend upon and extend results from recently
              completed and ongoing research that these investigators have been involved in
              as part of the Synthesis and Modeling Project of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean
              Flux Study.
