              Processing and Channel Modelling in Low-Dimensional Subspaces for Wireless
              Communication in Multi-Antenna Systems  Abstract  The problem of
              communicating information between a fixed basestation and many mobile
              peripherals dominates much of current research in wireless communication. The
              problem is tecnologically challenging because the channel that connects the
              basestation to the peripherals is random and time-varying. The most general
              solution requires space-time coding and signal processing that is "matched" to
              the channel. The objective of this research program is to extend the theory of
              space-time array processing (STAP) developed for radar applications, to
              multi-antenna wireless communication over fading channnels, in order to
              determine when and how channel structure can be exploited for space-time
              signal processing gain and/or diversity. Theoretically, the results of this
              research advance the understanding of multi-antenna wireless communication
              between antenna arrays. Practically, they suggest methods for adaptively
              communicating between fixed basestations and mobiles and between fixed
              computers and movable storage area networks.  Prior results by the principal
              investigators suggest that only the span of a low-dimensional channel subspace,
              and not the detailed physics of its coordinate representation, is required for
              the design of signals that optimize transmit diversity, and tranceivers that
              optimize the trade off between space-time processing gain and diversity.
              Moreover, the optimum transceiver statistics are just estimators of output
              signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), suggesting that transceiver
              statistics for decoding data can be used to estimate and track output SINR and
              network capacity. This means power and bandwidth may be adaptively allocated,
              using only transceiver statistics. So, in broad outline, this program is
              addressed to space-time channel modelling, using subspace methods; subspace
              signal and transceiver design for gain and diversity; and estimation of network
              capacity, using only transceiver statistics.
