Abstract    :
              Computer modeling of metallurgical processes can be used to enhance process
              control and product quality. Full exploitation of the high-level of currently
              available computational tools requires improved accuracy of the physical
              property input data. In particular, surface tension of molten metals critically
              influences the characteristics of metals processing. For high-quality
              measurements of surface tension, it is mandatory to establish the concentration
              of surface-active elements present in the melt. The most ubiquitous species is
              oxygen; it is present under all practical conditions involving molten metals
              and is a major factor effecting surface tension, even at parts per million
              levels. Since it is practically impossible to totally eliminate the presence of
              oxygen in reactors and vessels, the oxygen potential needs to be closely
              monitored. This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program
              support a program to build a high temperature maximum bubble pressure (MBP)
              device equipped with a solid electrolyte based sensor/control to monitor the
              oxygen potential in the probe. This combination is uniquely suited for
              measuring surface tensions of reactive alloys since: (1) the MBP probes beneath
              the surface of the melt and the probed surface area is small compared to the
              volume of the melt; and (2) the oxygen potential in the gas stream responsible
              for creating the probed surface is monitored through an oxygen
              sensing/controlling device. The instrumentation developed under this program
              will be made available to students at Carnegie Mellon during laboratory session
              designed to study the structure and properties of metals in their molten state.
              Furthermore, it is expected that the ability to establish the effect of the
              oxygen potential on the surface tension and the effects of the presence of 2D
              surface phases, will significantly contribute to ongoing and future research
              projects at Carnegie Mellon that study the surface thermodynamics of
              alloys.  In order to fully appreciate the tools offered by computer models in
              predicting metallurgical processes for process control and product quality, it
              is necessary to parallel the advances in process modeling with improved
              accuracy of the physical data that are used as input. Surface tension of molten
              metals is a key property since it influences (1) the conversion of liquid
              droplets to solids during the production of metal-alloy powders; (2) the
              formation of gas pores during casting which diminish the final metal strength;
              and (3) the formation and shape of impurity inclusions during the processing of
              steels. However, it is experimentally extremely difficult to perform accurate
              surface tension measurements of molten reactive alloys such as stainless steels
              and superalloys. This is due to the fact that oxygen is always present in trace
              amounts, which will react with the metals. Since even low levels of dissolved
              oxygen in the metal can change the surface tension significantly, it is
              critical to control its concentration accurately. The award from the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research program instrumentation supports the
              development of a novel combination of a probe that measures the surface tension
              under the surface of metals and an oxygen pump/sensor that controls and
              monitors the oxygen level.  The instrument will benefit the metals processing
              industry and increase the understanding of the physical chemistry of surfaces
              in the molten state and thereby positively impacting research as well as
              education in materials chemistry. The instrument built under this program will
              be implemented in laboratory classes at Carnegie Mellon changing the fact that
              the important molten state of materials has so far been little studied by
              students.
