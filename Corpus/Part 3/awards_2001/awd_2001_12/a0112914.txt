Abstract    :
              	Recent advances in computer and network technologies and storage, the explosion
              of publishing, and the vast increase in data availability from sources such as
              the Internet  and satellites, that have enabled the emergence of an
              unprecedented number of new computer applications, present a new challenge to
              the ways data and information are used and managed. This challenge will shape
              both the research agenda as well as the technology to be developed for the 21st
              century. The objective of this workshop is to bring together the PIs and Co-PIs
              currently funded by the Information and Data Management Program (IDM) of the
              National Science Foundation to:  (1) cooperatively analyze and focus on the
              research and development issues of  problems that are fundamental in making
              progress towards this new challenge; (2) share, provide demonstrations and
              interact with each other on the objectives, contributions and challenges of
              major research activities funded by the IDM and explore fruitful collaboration
              and synergism; and  (3) provide an opportunity to NSF program officers, other
              foundations and funding agencies, and industry representatives to learn more
              about the current research efforts and successes of projects funded by IDM, and
              for such officers to share their program highlights and concerns. 

The
              workshop will generate a proceedings  on all projects currently funded by IDM
              in both hard copy and electronic form. The workshop will also generate a report
              detailing future directions of research and will suggest promising modalities
              of research with an aim to foster innovation and technology transfer. The
              proceedings will provide project information searchable by different criteria
              and provide connections between discoveries and their use to society. The
              workshop website (http://itlab.uta.edu/idm01) will also include links to other
              relevant material.
