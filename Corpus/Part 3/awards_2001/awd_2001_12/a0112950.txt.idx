Abstract    :
              Geomaterials, i.e., soil and rock, are quite prevalent in nature and they are
              part of numerous engineering problems and solutions.  All civil engineering
              structures have to be ultimately supported on soils or rocks. Soils and rocks
              play an integral part in the behavior of civil engineering structures such as
              buildings, bridges, dams, levees, and aqueducts during catastrophic loading
              events such as earthquakes.  Soils are also major part of environmental
              problems and solutions.  Production of petroleum hydrocarbons involves rocks at
              large depths. Geomaterials are multiphase porous media consisting of a solid
              skeleton and number of fluids within the pore space.  Geomaterials exhibit
              highly nonlinear and hysteretic behavior during various loading situations. 
              Traditionally the engineers have treated the above-mentioned processes
              separately and often with simplifying assumptions.  With the recent advances
              made in Information Technology (IT) in areas such as scalable parallel computer
              algorithms, distributed computer systems, high speed networks, and
              visualization it is now possible to realize a unified geo-analysis tool for
              solving current and future problems involving geomaterials where unnecessary
              simplified assumptions need not be made and the full 3-D model of a real world
              system can be analyzed.  A key component in achieving this unified analysis
              tool is a framework-based finite element application.  A framework represents a
              collection of common software components for building applications in some
              common domain.  The basic premise behind the use of a framework is the
              recognition of a common set of tasks that must be accomplished in writing the
              applications. These tasks can be factored out of the application codes and
              collected into a single set of components.  Essentially a framework separates
              physics of a problem from the computer science aspects of solving that problem.
                This project is directed toward developing a scalable, parallel
              geo-analysis tool using a framework-based finite element application in a
              three-way collaboration between the University of Oklahoma (OU), the TeraScale,
              LLC, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  This tool and the
              underlying framework will be readily available to the academic community and
              industry at a fraction of the cost of similar monolithic codes.  This analysis
              tool will initially be capable of analyzing static and dynamic behavior of dry,
              unsaturated, and saturated soils (fluid flows and solid skeleton deformations).
               However, as opposed to the "closed" architecture of the proprietary monolithic
              codes, the "open" architecture of the framework will provide users with easy
              extendibility to include other multi-physics behavior in geomaterials.    The
              resulting tool will be verified first using closed-form solutions of simple
              problems in saturated and unsaturated soils.  Then the tool will be validated
              using centrifuge model tests results for boundary value problems. 
              Computational experiments will be conducted to test the analysis tool's
              capabilities under various distributed and parallel computing environments. On
              the educational front the TeraScale framework will be integrated into courses
              such as the Introduction to Finite Element Method and thereby introducing
              students to this new paradigm in engineering analysis and IT concepts such as
              scalable parallel computing.  Using Oklahoma's OneNet, High School students in
              Oklahoma will be provided an opportunity to manipulate and view the results
              from the proposed geo-analysis tool as well as conduct some simple analyses
              through the Internet.  Seeing and interacting with visualization of exciting
              problems such as the earthquake loading of a dam will help recruit more High
              School students to science and engineering.  It is expected that the
              geo-analysis tool developed will not only make the current advances in IT, such
              as the distributed computing, widely accessible to engineering community, but
              also advance various aspects of IT research itself in a synergetic manner.  For
              example, the proposed geo-analysis tool will serve as a test case for
              evaluating the efficiency of current and future distributed computing
              facilities.
