Abstract    :
              The LinBox group of twelve researchers in three countries (USA, France, Canada)
              proposes research in the design of efficient algorithms for linear algebra, in
              their implementation in a software library, and in how to interface the library
              to widely-used scientific computing software. Algorithms will be implemented,
              and new algorithms designed, for  the black box representation of
              matrices---hence the name LinBox---over entry domains  that are either
              symbolic, that is, exact, or floating point, that is, inexact. The library is
              generically programmed as C++ template classes with abstract underlying
              arithmetics; they can be compiled with a variety of fast libraries for the
              basic field, floating point, and polynomial operations. A server/client
              interface seamlessly attaches the library to the common general purpose
              symbolic systems Maple and Mathematica and to the numeric system MatLab.
              Parallel execution of the implemented algorithms is facilitated.      Black
              box matrices are stored as functions (as linear operators in effect): the
              matrix is a procedure that takes an arbitrary vector as input and efficiently
              computes the matrix-times-vector product. Black box linear algebra generalizes
              sparsity. The LinBox library will contain algorithms for solving singular and
              non-singular systems of linear equations whose coefficient matrix is given in
              black box representation. Furthermore, it is proposed to develop fast methods
              for the rank and the minimal and characteristic polynomial of a black box
              matrix. Finally, LinBox will contain methods for linear Diophantine problems
              with black box matrices, such as computing an integral solution to a linear
              system with integer entries and  computing the Smith normal form of an integer
              matrix.
