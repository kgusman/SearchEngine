Abstract    :
                   CDMA systems have achieved great commercial success in wireless
              communications since the first IS-95 system was deployed in Seattle in 1994.
              In fact, most of the future wireless communication systems will be using CDMA
              technology. Yet, as far as reaching the great potential of CDMA in terms of
              higher system capacity, lower bit error rate, and lower packet loss rate, the
              problem of demodulation in the presence of multiple access interference
              remains as a significant bottleneck for all CDMA systems. To solve this
              multiple access interference problem, researchers and engineers have worked
              since the early 1980's on so-called multiuser detectors (MUD). Unfortunately,
              thus far none of the multiuser detectors has been implemented in a real CDMA
              system, because of the prohibitive complexity of these structures.      There
              are two major factors that contribute to this situation. First, CDMA systems
              must use long spreading sequences for several practical reasons, whereas
              multiuser detectors must use short spreading sequences. Second, the complexity
              of even the simplest multiuser detector is still too great to be implemented
              in the fastest electronics, for all but the smallest of data rates. In this
              work, we propose to address both of these problems in a collaborative effort.
              The collaboration will be organized so that Dr. Qingchong Liu of Oakland
              University in Rochester, Michigan, will initially focus on the first
              objective, and Dr. David W. Matolak of Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, will
              initially (and concurrently) focus on the second objective. Results will be
              exchanged frequently, and meetings will be held quarterly. After some early
              progress, our collaboration will grow closer as we combine the work objectives
              and consider system (transmitter and receiver) performance.      We propose
              first to extend some recent results obtained for the construction of long
              spreading sequences from short sequences. This can be termed the system
              objective. These new sequences will be appropriate for both conventional CDMA
              systems and for multiuser detectors. This method was invented by one of us and
              has been implemented in possibly the fastest wireless network running
              at 400Mbps in the Spaceway system by Hughes Electronics. It has significantly
              reduced receiver complexity and cost, and gives essentially optimum
              performance. By measuring sequence correlations at multiple levels, the method
              provides new insights on sequence design and tremendously reduces complexity
              in signal design and detection for broadband wireless communications. This
              method has the potential to help bridge a gap between current CDMA systems and
              multiuser detectors.      We also propose to study reduced complexity
              multiuser receivers from the perspective of reduced complexity trellis search
              techniques, combined with one of the most promising MUD receiver
              structures, in a partitioned manner. This can be termed the receiver
              objective. The MUD receiver of interest is the minimum mean-squared error
              (MMSE) receiver, which is attractive for its good performance and modest
              complexity. The partitioning approach will aim to share the detection tasks
              between the MMSE front-end and the reduced-complexity trellis processor. These
              receivers will make use of the new spreading sequences specified for use in
              future 3 rd and 4 th -generation CDMA wireless communication system standards,
              and the multiple level sequences developed in the system objective. The
              reduced complexity trellis search techniques will explore use of the analogous
              techniques researched for equalization, but not fully applied to the problem
              of CDMA multiuser detection. Our goal for these two objectives is to create a
              fundamental bridge to connect the existing and planned CDMA systems with
              the theoretical multiuser detectors so that the bottleneck of the multiple
              access interference problem in CDMA systems can be surmounted.      Both
              objectives of this proposed work will employ analysis, followed by computer
              simulations. Both objectives will also require the assistance of graduate and
              undergraduate students. The modeling work will aim to reconcile theory with
              practical implementation and thus provide engineering education in the best
              sense: connecting principles and practice. Training students in both system
              design and receiver design for CDMA will also naturally be valuable to the
              wireless industry. In addition, the research will provide material for
              inclusion in several new graduate courses, and in undergraduate
              design projects, at both universities.
