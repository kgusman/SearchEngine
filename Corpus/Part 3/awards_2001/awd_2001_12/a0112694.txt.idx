Abstract    :
              0112694 Dixon  This grant, supported through funds from the NSF/Information
              Technology Research - Small Grants Program and the EAR/Instrumentation and
              Facilities Program, will enable the development of a first-generation data and
              model assimilation system for volcanic hazard assessment.  Essentially, this
              system will use Bayesian forecasting techniques to construct hazard estimates
              that incorporate both prior geologic information and near-real-time data types.
              The primary goal is to demonstrate, through the application of information
              technology methodologies, that such disparate geologic data types can be
              combined smoothly, even during volcanic crises, to yield improved estimates of
              hazard and risk. The focus will be on hazards associated with the dispersion
              and accumulation of volcanic tephra (volcanic ash), both because of the
              importance of this volcanic hazard and our previous experience in forecasting
              tephra hazards.  Models will be used to relate observed tephra-stratigraphies
              at several volcanoes (Colima, Cerro Negro, Montserrat, Popocateptal) to sets of
              input parameters, including eruption duration, initial gas content, and
              meteorological conditions.  We plan to explore several techniques (inversion,
              simplified models, database development) to relate observed patterns of volcano
              deformation directly to the parameter estimates used in tephra fallout models.
              The system will be constructed using parallel algorithms to exploit inexpensive
              and widely available PC clusters.  Through the auspices of an ITR grant, we
              plan to clearly demonstrate the huge advantages realized by, for the first
              time, systematically linking the geologic record, process models, and near-real
              time monitoring results. For tephra accumulation hazards specifically, this
              approach will further lead to a clear understanding of the links between
              deformation, magma processes, and the fundamental parameters governing tephra
              dispersion and accumulation. In this sense, the results of the systematic
              approach advocated here will provide guidance about the volcanological research
              most likely to results in volcanic hazard reduction.  This research will be
              conducted as a collaborative proposal between the University of Miami, the
              University of South Florida, and Southwest Research Institute (nonprofit). In
              addition, international collaboration with the University of Bristol will bring
              expertise on tephra dispersion modeling and data on the important Montserrat
              eruptions to the project. Students will contribute to all phases of the
              project, including geological research, model development, and software
              development. After appropriate testing, we plan to make the results of this
              project widely available by open-sourcing the codes and providing assistance in
              implementation of PC clusters to the volcanological community.  ***
