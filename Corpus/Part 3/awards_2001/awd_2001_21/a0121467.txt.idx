              Abstract CTS-0121467 Derby, J U of Minnesota - Twin Cities  Modeling the
              Growth of Crystals from Solution: Nonlinear Interactions of Kinetics and
              Transport  The growth of crystalline materials ranges from the one-time
              creation of milligrams of single-crystal protein pharmaceuticals to the annual
              production of metric tons of electronic-grade silicon. Due to these broad
              applications, the great variety of crystals needed, and the exacting quality
              typically required of single-crystal materials, their successful growth ranks
              among the most difficult challenges of modern materials processing. The work
              proposed here is part of longer-term effort to employ mathematical modeling
              coupled with numerical methods and high performance computing to understand
              crystal growth processes and the influence of processing conditions on crystal
              structure and composition.  The primary goal of the research contained in
              this proposal is to develop and apply modeling tools to understand the
              interactions of transport phenomena and crystal growth kinetics in solution
              crystal growth processes. The specific tasks proposed here include the study of
              fluid dynamics and mass transfer at the continuum level, the continued
              development of step-growth model to describe the growth of vicinal facet, and
              the linking of these two models in self-consistent manner. The proposed
              research will significantly extend the modeling capabilities and understanding
              of solution crystal growth systems. The multi-scale model proposed here couples
              methods for computing three-dimensional, time-dependent flow and transport in
              the bulk with detailed surface kinetic models based on ideas of step growth
              dynamics. Such an approach has yet to be successfully implemented for
              describing realistic solution crystal growth processes.  In addition, powerful
              ideas from nonlinear dynamics, namely chaotic mixing to describe the bulk
              system and nonlinear dynamics to describe step growth on the facet, will be
              applied to study solution crystal growth systems in novel manner.  The
              predictive capability provided from the models developed in this work will be
              of great utility for understanding solution crystal growth experiments and for
              the rational optimization of growth processes. More importantly, knowledge
              generated from this work will ultimately lead to the ability to link crystal
              properties with growth conditions and the macroscopic factors which influence
              them. In general terms, the understanding gained from successful modeling of
              crystal growth systems will lead to better process operation and design,
              ultimately yielding better quality crystals at higher production rates and
              lower costs. As another outcome of this work, the computational challenges of
              realistically modeling these systems are significant, and the continued
              development of algorithms for high performance computing will be noteworthy.
              Such developments are needed to advance them realistic modeling of materials
              processing systems using state-of-the-art scientific computation.  There are
              also broader impacts of this proposed activity. The fundamental issues
              addressed here are applicable to many other processes, including the
              hydrothermal and flux growth of crystals, liquid-phase epitaxy, and industrial
              crystallization (including protein crystals and other organic crystals). The
              development of the theoretical tools and the increased understanding of the
              coupling of transport and kinetics during the growth of crystalline materials
              obtained from this research will undoubtedly impact these areas. Finally,
              significant component of this activity is the training of Ph.D. graduate
              students and undergraduate students in research involving crystal growth,
              mathematical modeling, and high performance computing.
