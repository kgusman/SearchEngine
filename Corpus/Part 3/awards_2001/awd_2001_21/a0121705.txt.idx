Abstract    :
              Calcium plays a critical role in many metabolic processes in eukaryotic
              organisms, serving as a key intracellular signaling molecule that ultimately
              affects numerous cellular activities.  However, a systematic analysis of the
              role of calcium function has not been performed in any prokaryote.  The goal of
              this project is to investigate the involvement of calcium in bacterial cellular
              processes, metabolism, and regulation.  The marine bacterium Vibrio
              parahaemolyticus will be used as a model system.  This organism has a number of
              attributes that make it attractive for this study.  V. parahaemolyticus
              undergoes significant phenotypic changes in response to altered calcium levels,
              including changes in colony morphology.  In addition, data strongly suggest
              that calcium levels regulate gene expression in V. parahaemolyticus.  Thus,
              calcium is likely to play a role in cellular processes in this organism.  In
              this project, experiments will be performed to:  (i) obtain biochemical support
              for an involvement of calcium in V. parahaemolyticus metabolism, (ii) identify
              and characterize cellular processes in V. parahaemolyticus that are affected by
              calcium levels, and (iii) identify genes involved in calcium metabolism or that
              are regulated by calcium.  Many biological processes in numerous organisms,
              including plants and animals, require calcium ions.  The project described
              above is important because, although calcium ions are likely to play important
              roles in bacterial processes, a thorough investigation of the involvement of
              calcium in these organisms has not been performed.  The experiments described
              above are expected to significantly increase understanding of the role of
              calcium in bacteria at the biochemical, cellular, and molecular level.
