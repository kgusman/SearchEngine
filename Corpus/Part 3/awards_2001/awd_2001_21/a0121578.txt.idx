Abstract    :
              The emerging National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology
              Education Digital Library (NSDL) includes many sets of items whose
              representations, while different at the user level, contain semantically
              related information.  Consider, for example, the association between land-use
              maps of some region, and references to that region in a book concerning
              agricultural practices.  The NSDL aims to support its users with services that
              help them find and integrate such semantically related information in such
              heterogeneously represented items.  This project is constructing operational
              services to make it easy for users of the NSDL to have integrated access to
              information from texts, maps, and images--specifically, information that is
              semantically related in terms of geospatial features and regions.  These
              services will help users find:  -- maps or images containing features or
              places that are referred to implicitly within texts, and -- texts that
              implicitly reference features and places contained in maps and images.  More
              advanced services will help users evaluate the consistency between geospatial
              information obtained from such varying sources.  Collectively, these services
              will allow large collections of texts to be indexed and accessed geospatially,
              even if their "cataloging records" do not contain explicit geospatial
              references.  To implement these services, the project team is integrating the
              geospatial search services of the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL;
              http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu) at the University of California at Santa
              Barbara with the high-performance information retrieval (IR) services developed
              by the Illinois Institute of Technology's Information Retrieval Laboratory
              (http://www.ir.iit.edu).  The key component in this integration is the 4+
              million item gazetteer and associated services developed for ADL.  (A gazetteer
              provides a mapping between textual representations of places and features, and
              coordinate-based representations of their geospatial "footprints," thus
              allowing a semantic mapping to be made in either direction between textual and
              map/image representations of related phenomena.)  Specifically, the project
              team is integrating a gazetteer into an IR engine, integrating an IR engine
              into a geospatial digital library, and developing services that check the
              consistency of alternative geospatial references.  These services will allow
              seamless geospatial queries across distributed heterogeneous (text and
              non-text) digital libraries and will enable geospatial referencing of texts
              that have not otherwise been geographically cataloged (i.e., almost all texts
              currently available).
