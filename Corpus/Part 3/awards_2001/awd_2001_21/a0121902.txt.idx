Abstract    :
              This Scalable Enterprise Systems Phase II project effort will build upon the
              work in Phase I by:   (1) extending the relational decision framework to
              support efficient integration of distributed heterogeneous databases into a
              global decision framework; (2) building on the theory of co-evolutionary search
              algorithms using intelligent agents to address issues in multi-criteria
              decision-making; and (3) developing a comprehensive model of dynamic decision
              networks, integrating characteristics of software algorithms and network
              hardware and software for communications in order to evaluate performance and
              guide system design.  Advances in information technologies are driving
              fundamental changes in the processes and organizations of global enterprises. 
              Innovations in software, networks, and database systems enable widely
              distributed organizations to integrate activities, share information,
              collaborate on decisions, and execute transactions.  While many existing tools
              and techniques of information infrastructure may be adopted and implemented to
              support these enterprise applications, there has been little focused research
              to provide a scientific basis to support these developments.    A major
              outcome of this research will be an integrated demonstration of network-based
              distributed decision methods applied to real industrial problems and evaluated
              through sophisticate evaluation and simulation methods.  The outcomes of this
              work offer advantages of local autonomy, reliability, improved performance,
              scalability, shareability, data confidentiality, and efficient software support
              for a new class of enterprise-level software systems.  This research project
              includes efforts to incorporate these ideas into existing and new educational
              programs and courses with special attention to the recruiting and retention of
              underrepresented groups.
