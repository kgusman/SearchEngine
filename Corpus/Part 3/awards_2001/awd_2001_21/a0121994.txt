              ABSTRACT

Earthquakes and Tectonics of the Pacific Northwest:
An Educational
              Outreach for Teachers, Students and Communities

This project supports
              development of an online geological exhibit and a visiting geologist program as
              part of an educational outreach initiative for students, teachers and the
              public by The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture of the University of
              Washington. The initiative consists of three integrated and complementary
              programs: 1) A traveling exhibit entitled in Earthquakes and Tectonics of the
              Pacific Northwest, 2) a visiting geologist program to interact personally with
              local schools and citizen groups, and 3) a new generation Internet exhibit
              entitled, Northwest Origins: Geologic Evolution of the Pacific Northwest that
              explores the initiative topics and promotes engaging visualization of the
              large-scale tectonic processes that have created the Pacific Northwest over
              geologic time. The initiative is in response to the recent major earthquake
              that broadly affected residents
throughout western Washington and Oregon.
              Personal experience with a major seismic event has greatly heightened public
              interest in tectonic processes active in the Pacific Northwest. The goals of
              the project are to better educate citizens and students about the geologic
              events that
create earthquakes, the different tectonic settings in which
              earthquakes occur, the role these tectonic processes have played in creating
              the lands of the Pacific Northwest over geologic time, and the significance of
              ongoing research programs.
