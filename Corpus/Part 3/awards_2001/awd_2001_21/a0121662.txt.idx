Abstract    :
                   We propose to explore the architecture and device development issues
              necessary to develop optical LAN's that are ready to interface with optical
              MAN's. Our goal is to develop a clear plan for integration of LAN's and MAN's
              in order to improve the degree to which the benefits of high bandwidth in the
              MAN's are delivered to end users on the LAN's.  The application of
              architectural techniques to this problem cannot be effectively pursued without
              understanding the capabilities of proposed and available devices, yet the needs
              of architecture should strongly guide device development to ensure usefulness
              and relevance. To address these issues, we have formed a synergistic
              partnership between network architecture and hardware technology groups.     
              At the architectural level, we will explore issues in the design and evaluation
              of robust optical LAN architectures with explicit focus on the means of access
              to MAN's and on the capabilities necessary for both LAN nodes and the MAN-LAN
              interfaces (MLI's). The MLI's will serve as both hub and head-end for the LAN
              and will provide a simple interface between the LAN and the MAN. We will
              explore the robustness of these architectures to faults and will quantify the
              benefits of exploiting wavelength conversion and tunable sources to improve a
              network's robustness to failures with a range of automatic protection
              algorithms. Using wavelength conversion at MLI's, we will study the impact of
              wavelength conversion on robustness and network routing. Using wavelength
              conversion to enhance robustness has received very little attention, whereas
              routing is the focus of substantial previous work. We will also explore the
              effectiveness of optically transparent paths as limited by noise and insertion
              loss in the devices, and will study the tradeoffs between network capacity and
              robustness given these routing limitations.      At the device level, we will
              explore devices and subsystems that trade some functionality for increased
              simplicity or improved cost-effectiveness. The first of these elements is a
              multi-cavity VCSEL, which exploits the underlying physics to produce
              wavelength-tunable transmitters at a fraction of the cost of current tunable
              sources. These VC-SEL's will fill the gap between inexpensive, non-tunable
              VCSEL's available in a small range of wavelengths, and high-end, carrier-grade
              lasers. Our proposed tunable VCSEL's are intended to fulfill the requirements
              of MAN/LAN environments, which are a hybrid of current core networks and
              current LAN's.      We also plan to develop optical wavelength converters
              based on dual-pump, four-wave mixing. The dual-pump design enhances both the
              efficiency and the range of the converter, and can also provide polarization
              independence.  High efficiency is necessary to reduce or to eliminate the need
              for regeneration of optical signals within the MAN-LAN environment. Only a
              single wavelength enters the wavelength converter, thus the filter eliminates
              the effects of coherent and incoherent crosstalk between wavelengths that
              arises through four-wave mixing. SOA-based wavelength conversion is typically
              cheaper than other approaches, but suffers from poorer noise figures stemming
              from the use of the SOA, which make them less attractive for long-distance
              applications in core networks. For the MAN-LAN environment, SOA's present an
              attractive and economical alternative that allows ubiquitous availability of
              wavelength converters at switching nodes. Third, we will develop high-speed
              photodetectors based on indium-phosphide materials. The development
              of high-speed photodetectors helps to maintain fairly lean wavelength
              requirements in local and metropolitan areas, avoiding the challenges of dense
              WDM. While more aggressive scalability is attractive in many ways, a single 80
              Gbps wavelength can move a terabyte of data in less than two minutes. A single
              wavelength with effective access mecha-nisms can be used as a virtual private
              network if appropriately deployed over a LAN/MAN infrastructure.      Finally,
              we propose to develop tunable 2x2 switch elements based on indium phosphide
              ring resonators. Such devices allow a single wavelength to be selected and
              exchanged by the switch while all other wavelengths pass through untouched.
              These switches serve as building blocks for several important components,
              including tunable receivers and low insertion loss, low-crosstalk, high-speed
              optical crossconnects.      The development of these network elements will
              guide the types of systems that the network architecture group examines. At the
              same time, results from the network architecture group in terms of maximum
              system gain for a given approach (i.e., wavelength conversion, add-drop
              capability) will influence the direction of the hardware technology
              development. We believe that this approach is the best method for optimizing
              the architecture of next-generation fiber-optic WDM systems within the
              framework of the network element technology.      The research will be
              conducted by a group of five faculty (S. L. Chuang, K. Choquette, I. Adesida,
              and S. Lumetta from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and M.
              Medard from MIT) in the optoelectronic device and computer networking areas.
              This project will foster collaboration between system and device researchers to
              realize next-generation, high-performance, wavelength-agile optical networks.
