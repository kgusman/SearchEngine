Abstract    :
              0121563 Ostrom    This Americas Program award will support thesis
              dissertation research by Dr. Maria Angelica Toniolo under the direction of Dr.
              Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University-Bloomington and in collaboration with Dr.
              Daniel Nepstad of the Intituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazonia (IPAM).  Ms.
              Toniolo plans to explore the impact of different property regimes on the
              incidence of accidental fires in smallholder communities in Tapajos National
              Park in the Santarem region of Para state in north central Brazil.  The
              ultimate objective of this comparative study is to produce a rigorous
              assessment of the relationship between accidental fires, small farming
              practices, forest fragmentation, and property regimes and, thereby, contribute
              to the understanding of deforestation processes and the formulation of
              conservation policy in the Amazon.  Results of this proposal will be relevant
              for improving current understanding of the underlying interactions among land
              tenure, decision making regarding land use and management of accidental fires. 
              It will allow for the creation of a fire-risk map at the farm-community level,
              which can be used to indicate and minimize risk in areas that need special
              attention in terms of fire prevention.  The study will apply two different
              approaches based on Geographic Information System (GIS) to model the likelihood
              of accidental fires at the farm community level.  It will also add new
              information to the National Program of Prevention and Control of Fires in the
              Deforestation Arch (PROARCO) and to the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere
              Experiment in Amazonia (LBA).
