Abstract    :
              This award from the Engineering Research Centers Program is to connect the
              expertise in large-scale computational simulation and visualization at the
              Engineering Research Center on Computational Field Simulation at Mississippi
              State University, in geotechnical and structural response simulation at the
              Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center at the University of California,
              Berkeley, and in advanced computational ground motion and
              soil-foundation-structure-interaction modeling at Carnegie Mellon University to
              develop an advanced computational capability for modeling and visualizing the
              effects of earthquakes in urban regions on the built infrastructure, and to
              apply this capability to simulate the performance of collections of buildings
              and other structures in an urban region. The ultimate goal is to forecast the
              amount and distribution of damage throughout an urban region.  The proposed
              methodology will integrate "end-to-end" the earthquake source, path, basin, and
              surficial effects of the geological structure of the region on ground motion,
              with realistic models of buildings and bridges, including
              soil-foundation-structure-interaction effects, to develop a distributed, high
              resolution simulation capability.   Key features of the proposed distributed
              high-performance computational simulation environment are the following:
              realistic representation of the structure type, geometry and properties;
              detailed modeling of the soil structure in the near region of the structure;
              use of real surface topology and sub-surface geotechnical properties; high
              resolution in the node density of the ground motion to capture the higher
              frequencies required for determining structural response; explicit
              consideration of soil-structure-foundation interaction effects; analysis of the
              simultaneous earthquake response of a portfolio of buildings to examine
              structure-to-structure interaction effects through the soil and the effects of
              the built environment on the free-field earthquake ground motion; automated
              data storage, access, and transport; visualization of complex and large
              datasets representing behavior of individual structures and aggregates; and
              integration of these components in a distributed computational environment. 
              This project will use the simulation environment to investigate the effects of
              earthquakes in the Los Angeles urban region.  This problem is of great
              importance to hazard mitigation and seismic risk reduction because assessing
              the ground motion to which structures will be exposed during their lifetimes,
              and predicting their response to this ground motion, including potential
              damage, is an essential step for the appropriate design and retrofit of
              earthquake-resistant built infrastructure.  Performance-based earthquake
              engineering methodologies are motivated by the need for scientific and
              transparent methods to relate seismic hazard to structural performance and
              loss. Forecasting damage and loss can also be of great use for emergency
              planning and management purposes. Visualization of damage in an urban region
              can aid policy makers and stakeholders in making informed decisions on how to
              reduce earthquake losses. The proposed simulation environment will use the
              Globus toolkit for access to the computational grid, the deployment of which
              NSF plans to support as part of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake
              Engineering Simulation (NEES).  When developed, the simulation environment will
              be accessible to the earthquake engineering community through NEES.
