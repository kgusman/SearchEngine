Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Poldrack will conduct a year long
              investigation of a new approach to enhancing brain plasticity and increasing
              the speed of learning in adult humans. It has long been known that the brain
              changes extensively early in life, and that these changes are dependent upon
              particular experiences in the child's environment.  However, more recent
              research has discovered that the brain continues to change throughout adulthood
              in response to experience.  This ability to change is called plasticity, and is
              thought to underlie many forms of learning.  Dr. Poldrack's project will
              explore an approach based upon results from studies of experimental animals,
              which have shown that plasticity in the cerebral cortex can be greatly enhanced
              by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. New drugs,
              known as cholinesterase inhibitors, that safely and effectively increase
              acetylcholine levels in humans have recently been developed and FDA-approved.
              The specific drug that Dr. Poldrack will use is galanthamine hydrobromide
              (tradename Reminyl). The effect of the drug on cortical plasticity will be
              assessed using both visual behavioral testing and functional magnetic resonance
              imaging, which is a non-invasive method for measuring the brain activity that
              occurs as a person performs a cognitive or perceptual task. The behavioral
              measure will be the rate at which the subjects learn to more accurately perform
              a simple visual perceptual learning task: learning to discriminate the
              orientation of a grating.  The hypothesis to be tested is that learning of the
              visual task that takes place under the influence of the drug will proceed more
              quickly than learning that is paired with a placebo. Functional magnetic
              resonance imaging will be used to assess the effect of the drug on cortical
              plasticity, by comparing the pre-training versus post-training brain activation
              changes that are caused by learning the visual task while on the drug against
              those caused by learning the task on placebo.   If this new method of
              enhancing plasticity should turn out to be successful, it will provide
              fundamentally important and novel knowledge about the nature of plasticity in
              the adult human brain, and could also lead to a wide range of potential
              clinical and practical applications. Understanding how brain plasticity works
              in adult humans is of critical importance, because recent research suggests
              that plasticity can be capitalized upon in order to remediate neurological
              problems, such as movement disorders resulting from stroke or from repetitive
              strain injury, and reading and language disorders.
