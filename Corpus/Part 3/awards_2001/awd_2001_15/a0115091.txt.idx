Abstract    :
              This research project is to develop a millirobot system for rapid prototyping of
              complicated micromechatronic devices combining folded-sheet structures,
              commercial sensors, and actuators.  Folded sheet structures will provide not
              only a method for rapid-prototyping, but also a flexible mechanical fabrication
              capability for 3-dimensional mechanisms in the 1 to 10 mm size range. 
              Microassembly will provide the ability to construct 3-dimensional heterogenous
              microsystems by joining sensors, actuators, structures, and intelligence, which
              are separately fabricated, and ideally available off-the-shelf.  This research
              will address:  (1) Flexible fabrication methods using fixtures and millirobots
              to fold pre-cut sheets of material into 3D microstructures and bond in final
              configurations.  (2) Microassembly techniques using millirobots capable of
              precisely attaching 100 micron blocks as well as 12 micron or thinner sheets
              (such as strain gauges) through control of interaction forces.  (3) Algorithms
              which can compile an assembly plan, consisting of gripper and tool operations
              and fixture locations, which can then be used to rapidly prototype a complete
              microsystem, such as a 25 mm wing span micromechanical fly, including thorax
              structure, strain gauges, and piezoelectric actuators.  The goal is to allow
              a micro-system designer to go from design to first prototype in several hours,
              with additional prototypes being produced in minutes.  In the first stage of
              the prototype fabrication, a millirobot containing grippers and tools
              customizes the workspace by bonding fixtures at appropriate locations.  The
              passive fixtures are designed to dramatically reduce the complexity of the
              millirobot actuation, sensing, and control.  In effect, fixtures maximize
              off-line planning, and minimize millirobot hardware.  In the second stage of
              fabrication, the millirobot system can construct the prototype, and future
              copies of the prototype can be quickly made without additional workpiece setup
              time.  A broader impact of this research will be a low-cost rapid prototyping
              millirobot system which can be readily copied to provide a micro-tool 
              construction capability for any lab or school interested in developing
              micromechatronic systems.   Undergraduate students in the SUPERB Program will
              be included on the research team along with graduate students.
