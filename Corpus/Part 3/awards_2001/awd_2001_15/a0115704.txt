This grant, made through the Major Research
              Instrumentation (MRI) Program, provides full support of the costs of acquiring
              a bank of alpha spectrometers for uranium-series (238U-234U-230Th and
              226Ra-210Pb) isotope dating of speleothems and corals.  The equipment will
              include a Canberra Genie-2000 benchtop alpha analyst with dual alpha
              spectrometers, 450 mm2 PIPS detectors, hardware and software for operation and
              data reduction, as well as a radon analysis system composed of Storm King
              R-LPSS double Rn extraction system with an Applied Techniques model
              AC/DC-DRC-MK10-2 dual radon counting system.  Acquisition of this instrument
              will enable two lines of research in earth systems processes at Cornell
              College, including the impacts of environmental change on continental and
              shallow marine environments: (1) construction of speleothem-based records of
              Holocene climate variability from the midwestern U.S.A. and central Nepal and
              (2) analysis of the temporal resolving power of reef coral death assemblages as
              a means of assessing the response of reef coral communities to global climate
              change.  Both research areas will be addressed as faculty and faculty-guided
              undergraduate projects that will be combined with stable and radiogenenic
              isotope mass spectrometric analyses at the University of Iowa and the
              University of New Mexico.  The research experiences students receive using this
              alpha spectrometry system will enhance quantitative and analytical skills,
              expand appreciation for independent research as a tool for scientific training,
              introduce a variety of environmentally-oriented research topics, and develop
              peripheral skills including X-ray diffraction and optical microscope methods,
              stable isotopic analysis, and thermal ionization mass spectrometry.
