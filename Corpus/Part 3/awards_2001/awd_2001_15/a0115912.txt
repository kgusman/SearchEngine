Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Whitworth College will acquire a 750 Hz narrow-band
              argon fluoride laser.  This equipment will enhance research in the following
              areas:  1) development of a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) system to analyze
              wear on carbon-based ion thruster grids in situ; and 2) measurement of the
              dissociative resonance Raman spectra of several interesting molecules that
              photodissociate at 193 nm.  Researchers from several area institutions (Gonzaga
              University, Eastern Washington University, New Light Industries) would also use
              this laser system to carry out studies on nonlinear materials, photoacoustic
              spectroscopy of bacteria and to develop high-spatial frequency gratings for
              templates in the growth of controlled orientation colloidal photonic crystals. 
              Undergraduate students at Whitworth, Gonzaga and Eastern Washington will be
              heavily involved in the research efforts.  

A high repetition rate laser
              provides pulses of coherent visible or infrared light and enables researchers
              to obtain important information about fast occurring chemical reactions.  Its
              use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive
              and nonreactive molecules.  In particular, LIF is capable of detecting very
              small quantities of carbon atoms in the plumes of ion thrusters.  This will
              allow for a rapid diagnostic test for wear in these advanced thruster systems. 
              A switch to carbon-based thrusters will significantly increase the efficiency
              and lifetime of the ion thrusters, resulting in tremendous cost-savings.
