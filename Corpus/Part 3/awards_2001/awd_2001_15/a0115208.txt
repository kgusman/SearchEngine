Minority Engineering Education in
              the United States, 1945 to the Present

Despite ongoing governmental and
              institutional attempts at diversification, African
Americans and other
              minorities remain severely underrepresented among university
graduates in
              engineering fields. Many quantitative studies have measured this inequity
and
              the impacts of individual educational reforms, but few scholars have
              explored
historical or epistemological patterns behind the successes and
              failures of diversification
efforts. Using archives, artifacts, and
              approximately 35 interviews with engineering
instructors and graduates, this
              project compares engineering education in American
universities attended
              primarily by black students and white students since 1945 to
establish such an
              overview.

Based on four pairs of schools, representing each of four states
              and four historical
eras, this study describes the broad political conditions
              in which these universities
functioned, and provides detailed accounts of
              practices within their engineering
classrooms and laboratories. The cases of
              Lincoln University (Missouri) and the
University of Missouri will illustrate
              conditions during the science and engineering
"manpower" crisis immediately
              following World War II.  Technical programs at
Maryland State College and the
              University of Maryland will illustrate the impacts of
integration as
              separate-but-equal doctrines fell away in the 1950s. The histories of
              two
urban schools, the Kennedy-King College and Illinois Institute of
              Technology in
Chicago, will reflect the coalescence of civil rights activism
              and legislation in the 1960s
and 1970s; and comparisons of Prairie View and
              Texas A&M Universities will document
the ascendance of political conservatism
              and a "post-industrial" economy in the 1980s
and 1990s. Engineering curricula
              and course materials varied greatly among these
settings, and this project
              treats post-secondary technical education since 1945 as both a
reflection of
              prevailing social ideologies about race and a shaping force of those
              values.
It explores, overall, the uncertain connection between technical and
              social modernity in
contemporary America.
