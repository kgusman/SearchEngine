Abstract    :
              COLUMBUS URBAN SYSTEMIC PROGRAM

The Columbus Public Schools (CPS) serving
              64,339 students, in 144 schools, of which 62% are minority, 57% are poor, and
              3% are Limited-English-Proficient, through the Columbus Urban Systemic Program
              (CUSP), proposes to build upon the results realized under the Columbus Urban
              Systemic Initiative (USI).  During the USI, CPS developed a building-based,
              professional-development delivery infrastructure promoting standards-based
              curriculum, instruction, and assessment strategies in support of all students
              attaining high levels of academic achievement in mathematics and science.
              

Through the CUSP, the District states commitments to achieving the four
              driving goals of the USP Solicitation, NSF 01-15, related to improved student
              achievement, enhanced implementation of standards-based-inquiry-centered
              science and mathematics, increased competency and diversity of the
              instructional workforce, and intensified substantive collaborations with
              institutions of higher education towards improved teacher education.  The USP
              implementation process embraces three major components and attendant enabling
              strategies.  Therein, the CUSP will:
- Focus Efforts and Resources  Identify
              and target schools that have not fully implemented the standards-based
              curriculum for on-site professional development, monitoring of instruction, and
              increased parent involvement at those sites;
-Fund long-term professional
              development with interim follow-up, reflecting the success of past models and
              current technology standards;
-Focus on reaching full implementation of the
              standards-based curriculum in the District's lowest-implementation schools each
              year;
   Sustain support for students through summer bridge activities,
              internships and summer camps in mathematics, science, engineering, and
              technology; and
-Advocate and ensure that resources and facilities are
              sufficient to support the standards-based learning environment.
-Nurture
              Building-Level Leadership  Support existing K-12 instructional leadership teams
              and other in-service participants through on-going professional development and
              follow-up consistent with the National Staff Development Council
              standards;
-Assure that Instructional Leadership Teams (ILT) provide
              professional development to their staffs, serve as resources for other
              teachers, and coordinate school-wide mathematics and science events;
-Provide
              training for district-level curriculum specialists and Peer Assistance Review
              (PAR) consultants to ensure cohesive delivery of instruction;
-Coordinate
              in-depth training in the principal walk-through process;
-Expand incentives
              for the district's Performance Advancement System by encouraging university
              collaboration, action research, and dissemination of research related to
              improved student achievement in mathematics and science.
-Collaborate with
              Universities to Improve Teacher Education  Continue strengthening university
              alliances to impact the effectiveness of pre-service education, the diversity
              of the CPS workforce, the technological skill of CPS graduates, and classroom
              research on teaching and learning;
-Support CPS classified personnel in the
              pursuit of degrees in mathematics and science education;
-Provide a forum for
              cooperating and pre-service teachers in area universities to apply their
              knowledge of K-12 mathematics and science standards and technology utility;
              and
-Contribute as a consequential partner in university initiatives, i.e.,
              The Ohio State University Teacher Quality Institute, Project Discovery, the
              P-12 Initiative of the Ohio State University, and the Urban Academy, designed
              to increase student achievement by improving the quality of mathematics and
              science teacher education.
