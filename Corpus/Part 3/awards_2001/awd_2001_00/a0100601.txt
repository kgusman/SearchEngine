Abstract    :
              We investigate four major unsolved problems in or bordering on
              harmonic
analysis. These are the Kakeya problem, the Lipschitz
              differentiation
problem, the restriction problem, and global solvability for
              the
Navier Stokes equation. For the Kakeya problem, we continue our
work with
              Tao on improving exponents in the sums-differences approach.
For the problem
              of differentiation by Lipschitz vector fields, we try
to apply our work on
              maximal functions in arbitrary directions to
understand what are the
              limitations on a counterexample and hopefully
that none can exist. For the
              restriction problem, we try to apply
the new results on Kakeya and to better
              understand Bourgain's
machine for converting Kakeya results to ones about
              restriction.
For Navier Stokes, we first discretize everything in the
form of
              a kind of generalized wavelet coefficients. In work with
Pavlovic, this has
              already produced a generalization of
the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theorem to
              the case of hyperdissipation.
We hope from this point of view to discover a
              sort of local dispersion
property for the cascading effect from the nonlinear
              term. Then we
hope to tie in the Clay problem with a dyadic model in which
              this
dispersion is a given. As might be imagined, we are unlikely to
              solve
all these problems.


Analysis concerns the proof of estimates on
              interesting systems by
examing the contributions of all their parts. One such
              system is
the Navier Stokes equation which governs the behaviour of
              incompressible
viscous fluids. An important open problem is whether this
              equation
starting with smooth initial data can develop singularities
              without
a forcing term. This would akin to a cyclone beginning
              spontaneously
in one's bathtub. It seems rather unlikely but the tools of
              analysis
are not yet strong enough to rule it out. Our approach is
              to
discretize the problem, that is to try to approximate the problem
by one
              about a finite number of objects and investigate possible
interactions of
              those objects by means of combinatorics. Most
physically arising mathematics
              can be looked at this way because matter
is not continuous but rather composed
              of particles. We will work
on the above problem and some other important
              problems which may be
approached with the same point of view.
