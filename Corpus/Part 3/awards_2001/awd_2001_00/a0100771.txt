The aim of this project is to apply gauge-theory techniques
              to
the study of three-dimensional manifolds.  The principal
investigator
              proposes to investigate Floer homology and closely
related areas of geometry,
              and hopes to shed light on the
applicability of gauge theory to problems in
              three-dimensional
topology.  In particular, it is hoped that a relation can
              be
established between the Floer homologies of three-manifolds
defined on the
              one hand by the monopole equations on the other
hand by the instanton
              equations.  (These are the equations which,
in four-dimensions, lead
              respectively to the Seiberg-Witten
invariants and Donaldson invariants of
              four-manifolds, and which
have led to an flood of results in four-dimensional
              differential
topology in the past twenty years.)  A first goal is to
              prove
that if the instanton Floer homology of manifold with first
              betti
number one is trivial in the strong sense that all the
representations
              of the fundamental group can be made to disappear
by a holonomy perturbation,
              then the monopole Floer homology
groups are trivial also.  (For the instanton
              groups, the relevant
representations are the representations in SO(3) with
              non-trivial
Stiefel-Whitney class.)  By an application of a
              non-vanishing
theorem for the monopole Floer homology and use of Floer's
              exact
triangle, this would lead to a proof of the "Property P
conjecture".  A
              related goal in this project is the development
of new constructions for Floer
              homology, based on the technique
of finite-dimensional approximation (which
              has already seen
convincing application in the study of the
              four-dimensional
invariants).

Topology is the qualitative study of space
              and its connectedness.
Its importance was recognized at the turn of the last
              century by
the French mathematician Poincaro, during his investigation of
the
              laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body
system such as the
              Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to
Newton's laws.  In the past twenty
              years, topology has seen
applications in questions such as the knotting of
              proteins and
DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The
              topology
of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of
              higher
dimension, is of particular subtlety.  Through this project, it
is
              hoped to bring new techniques to bear on outstanding questions
in
              three-dimensional topology.  These techniques -- gauge theory
and the
              Seiberg-Witten equations -- originated in physics, where
they had potential
              application to fundamental questions such as
quark confinement.  They have
              been an effective tool in the study
of four-dimensional spaces (such as our
              space-time).  The aim now
is to apply the same techniques to questions in
              dimension three.
