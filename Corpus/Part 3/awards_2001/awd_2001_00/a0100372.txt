                      AUTOMORPHIC FORMS, L-FUNCTIONS AND GALOIS REPRESENTATIONS

    The
              princial investigator proposes to do the following: (i) attach
Galois
              representations to cusp forms of weight k > 1 over any CM field K (with totally
              real subfield F) by transferring certain associated forms on GL(4)/F to
              suitable unitary groups by making use of L-functions, trace formula,
              congruences, restrictions of Hasse invariant forms and pseudo-representations;
              (ii) construct certain special holomorphic forms on GSp(4)/Q, study their
              lifting to GL(4)/Q, and derive consequences for certain Galois representations;
              and (iii) to continue ongoing work with D. Prasad on a refinement of the local
              Langlands correspondence for self-dual representations of GL(n).

    The
              field of research of the P.I. is Automorphic Forms. The simplest, yet not so
              simple, instance of the basic problem of the field is the following: Start with
              a sequence of numbers {a_0, a_1 , a_2, a_3, .., a_n, ...} and consider the
              "generating function" f(q) = a_0 + a_1q + a_2q^2 + ... + a_nq^n + ...., where q
              is a dummy variable. A fundamental  question is to know when f(q) satisfies a
              "hidden symmetry". To elaborate, write q = exp(2\pi iz), with z a complex
              number of positive imaginary part, and set q* = exp(-2\pi i/z). What one is
              often looking for, and this shows up in disparate fields like string Physics
              and combinatorics, is a relationship between  the pair (f(q), f(q*)). One says
              that f has weight k if 
f(q*) =(-log q/2\pi i)^k f(q). The existence of such a
              symmetry 
implies that the sequence {a_n} we started with has miraculous
              properties. For example, when the a_n are multiplicative, i.e., when a_{mn} =
              a_ma_n for m,n  relatively prime, with a_0=0 and a_1=1, then there is an
              associated  2-dimensional Galois representation R coming from geometry whose
              associated "L-function" equals 1 + a_2/2^s + a_3/3^s + ..., implying that for
              each prime p, a_p =
u_p + 1/u_p with u_p an algebraic integer of absolute
              value p^{(k-1)/2}; in particular, |a_p|  is bounded by 2p^{(k-1)/2}, which is
              not provable by an apriori analytic estimate.  A key example to keep in mind is
              the ubiquitous Delta function q{(1-q)(1-q^2)(1-q^3)...)}^{24} = q+tau_2q^2 +
              tau_3q^3 + ..., which has weight 12. The general "Langlands program" envisions
              many such occurrances, and they involve a family of symmetries ("modularity")
              which are complicated to write down explicitly, but are nevertheless very
              important to pursue due to their far-reaching consequences. For example, one
              key ingredient of the celebrated proof of Fermat's last theorem by Wiles makes
              use of a result obtained in this program. In his work related to his
current
              (about to become preious) NSF proposal, the P.I. proved that given two
              functions f(q), g(q) as above attached to {a_n}, {b_n} respectively, admitting
              hidden symmetries of some weights, the product sequence {a_nb_n} is associated
              to a modular object of degree 4. This has the following consequence. Suppose f,
              g have the same weights, and suppose further that a_p^2 equals b_p^2 for almost
              all primes p. Then f equals g.
