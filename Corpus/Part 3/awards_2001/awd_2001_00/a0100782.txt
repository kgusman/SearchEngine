              Abstract for DMS - 0100782

(1) What is the distribution of the eigenvalues of
              a
random matrix, with certain symmetry conditions to
guarantee the reality of
              the spectrum? What happens to
the distribution, when the size of the matrix
              gets
large? What about universality in the limit?
(2) What is the statistics
              of the length of the
longest increasing sequence in random permutation
              or
random words (Ulam's problem). This question applies
to models of
              interface growth, polymers in random
environments, first passage percolation
              problem, and
 "dimer" configurations.
(3) Integrals over groups  and
              symmetric spaces, (or
over their tangent spaces) lead to a variety
              of
interesting matrix models. The coefficients of the
(perturbative)
              expansions have striking combinatorial
or topological significance and can be
              computed in a
recursive way. This work originates in the works of
Feynman, 't
              Hooft, Bessis-Itzykson-Zuber and Witten,
in the context of string theory.
(4)
              The sample canonical correlation coefficients
(maximum likelihood estimates)
              for the canonical
correlation coefficients of two Gaussian populations
are
              the test statistic for the statistical
independence of the two populations, as
              studied by
Hotelling, James and Constantine.
(5) The four problems above and
              their
"time"-perturbations are all solutions to integrable
equations or
              lattices. For large random matrices or
permutations, they are solutions to the
              Korteweg-de
Vries equation. In the finite case, they are solutions
to the
              Toda lattice, and to two new integrable
lattices, the Pfaff and Toeplitz
              lattices.
%Besides matrix integrals solutions, these lattices
%have
              interesting rational solutions.



It is fair to say that matrix integrals
              point the way
to new integrable systems, but also to new
combinatorial and
              probabilistic questions !
General description: The problems above
relate to a
              number of important questions in physics,
engineering and statistics:
Problem
              (1) has its origin in the study of energy
levels (excitation spectra) of heavy
              nuclei in nuclear
physics (Wigner, Dyson). These levels are so intricate
that
              any explicit description would be intractable.
For that reason, Wigner
              proposed a statistical model
for these energy levels. Concerning problem (2),
              
it is well known that a large percentage of computer 
time is devoted to the
              rearrangement of the data used 
in the course of computations. How many data,
              after a 
complete reshuffling, are statistically still in order? 
This
              question of random permutations also applies to
statistical mechanics, the
              basis of thermodynamics,
and to questions of polymers. Some of the matrix
              
models (3) provide toy models for string theory, 
an important set of ideas
              at the basis of the 
fundamental interactions in the physical world.
It turns
              out that certain matrix models, mentioned
above, are used in testing whether
              two sets of
statistical data are correlated, as sketched in (4).
The
              Korteweg-de Vries equation, the arch-type
``soliton equation", describes the
              propagation of
waves in shallow water; a similar non-linear
              partial
differential equation governs the propagation of
ultra-short pulses
              in optical fibers, when the wave
length is long compared to the diameter of
              the fiber.
