Abstract    :
              Doron Zeilberger proposes to continue to develop methodologies for harnessing
              the great potential of Symbolic Computation to do research in Combinatorics and
              related areas.  In particular he hopes to introduce new computational and
              conceptual frameworks that would extend the so-called Wilf-Zeilberger proof
              theory to much wider classes of identities and theorems.  He also proposes to
              continue his efforts in `Artificial Combinatorics', and develop algorithms for
              the discovery and {\it rigorous} proof of theorems in combinatorics whose
              complexity make them unfeasible for human proofs.  This research should be
              symbiotic, as it is expected that both the concrete results and  the underlying
              methodologies, would help computer algebra developers to improve and enhance
              their systems.

This research is in the general area of Combinatorics.  One
              of the goals of  Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how 
              discrete collections  of objects can be arranged.  The behavior of discrete
              systems is extremely  important to modern communications.  For example, the
              design of large networks, such as those occurring in  telephone systems, and
              the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of
              objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.  This research is also
              in the general area of  Symbolic Computation, that attempts to teach computers
              to perform research that previously required extensive human resources. 
              Progress in this area promises to have important ramifications to science  and
              technology.
