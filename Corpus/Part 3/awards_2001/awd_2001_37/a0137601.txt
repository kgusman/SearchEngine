Description: This project supports a cooperative research
              project by teams of scientists and graduate students headed by Dr. James
              Murray, School of Oceanography, University of Washington (UW), Seattle,
              Washington, Dr. Ilkay Salihoglu, Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS), Middle
              East Technical University, Erdemli-Icel, Turkey, and Dr. Sergey Konovalov,
              Marine Hydrophysical Institute (MHI), Ukraine National Academy of Sciences,
              Sevastopol, Ukraine. This two-year project will take advantage of new samples
              collected during the 2001 R/V Knorr research cruise in the Black Sea. The
              research is divided into three projects:  1. Spatial variability in the
              chemistry of oxygen, sulfide and nutrients in the upper layer of the anoxic
              zone in the Black Sea due to ventilation from the Bosphorus Inflow conducted by
              Dr. Murray and a UW graduate student, a Turkish scientist from IMS, and a
              Ukrainian scientist from MHI.  2.  Geochemistry of redox metals (including Mn,
              Fe, Cd, Mo, U, V, and Re) in particulate matter across the oxic/suboxic/anoxic
              layers in the water column of the Black Sea, conducted by Dr. Murray, a Turkish
              scientist, and a Turkish graduate student from IMS.  3.  Application of
              molecular genetic techniques for understanding population genetic structure of
              Calanus sp. conducted by two junior scientists from UW and a scientist and
              graduate student from IMS.  Two Turkish scientists and two Turkish graduate
              students will visit UW between January and April 2002. Two US junior scientists
              from UW will visit IMS in Turkey in June-July 2002. The Ukrainian scientist
              will travel to the US in winter 2003. Murray and his graduate student will
              travel to Turkey and Ukraine in April-May 2003, and a Turkish scientist will
              visit the US in August 2003.

Scope: This project complements research
              dealing with the Black Sea being carried out by the US PI under separate
              funding from the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences. This project will provide
              graduate students and scientists from Turkey a chance to use state of the art
              analytical techniques available in the US, but not in Turkey.  The
              collaboration will offer opportunities for two US junior scientists and one
              female US graduate student to participate in this international project.  It
              will allow scientists from all three countries to develop future international
              collaborations.  The project meets INT objectives of supporting projects of
              mutual benefit.  Funding is provided by the Office of International Science and
              Engineering and the Division of Ocean Sciences.
