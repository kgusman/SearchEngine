Abstract    :
              0137166/Werne

The main aims of this proposal are to develop a better
              understanding of mixing during the active phase of deep open-ocean convection
              and to obtain parameterizations of temperature and salinity changes occurring
              during convection.  Its physical novelty is that it includes the study of
              physical processes not previously examined in detail, including: (a) vortical
              interactions between plumes and (b) slant-wise convection.  The study will use
              ambitious numerical simulations to examine the dynamics of turbulent ensembles
              of convective plumes and will include the effect of the horizontal component of
              the Earth's rotation vector.   Simulations will use both the full Boussinesq
              equations as well as less stiff, asymptotically reduced sets of dynamical
              equations developed by the PIs.  The information on the lateral stirring and
              penetration of strong convective events in the upper ocean that will be
              developed in this project will be used to improve parameterizations of
              open-ocean convection in large-scale ocean models of the sort used to study
              global ocean circulation and climate.
