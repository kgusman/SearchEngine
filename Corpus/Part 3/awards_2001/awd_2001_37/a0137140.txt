This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on annotation and resource discovery of geographical
              image data to be held in Karuizawa, Japan from October 9-11, 2002.  The
              co-organizers are Professor Aidong Zhang of the State University of New York
              (SUNY) at Buffalo and Dr. Frederic Andres of the National Institute of
              Informatics (NII) in Tokyo, Japan.  This meeting will discuss research results
              of a current U.S.-Japan project on metadata modeling, resource discovery, and
              querying of large-scale geographical image datasets.  The seminar aims to
              demonstrate the current research achievement, clarify a variety of questions,
              and identify promising areas for future joint work.  The specific topics
              include:  1) extracting semantic features of geographic images,  2) detecting
              clusters of arbitrary shape of geographic images,  3) formulating the metadata
              for the integrated system to direct a query to relevant databases,  4)
              establishing a theoretical foundation of resource selection approaches based on
              the metadata, and  5) query processing to support content-based retrieval of
              geographic images.

The researcher's current project investigates novel
              approaches to supporting effective and efficient access to various geographic
              image databases over the Internet.  These approaches establish a foundation for
              creating a meta-level system on top of geographic image databases to support
              distributed geographic image retrieval.  Through this project a huge volume of
              geographic data (JIOMEDIA) is being collected and classified based on the
              semantics.  This asset will be accessible by users for research and educational
              purposes.  A set of software tools is being developed and will be made
              available for use of establishing a metaserver environment which manages
              large-scale geographic data resources.  The seminar advances international
              human resources through the participation of many postdocs and graduate
              students with some of them presenting papers.  Through the exchange of ideas
              and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and
              promote international understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to
              publish proceedings of the seminar on their Web pages.
