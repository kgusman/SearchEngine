This is a cooperative effort with the Bjerknes Center for
              Climate Research in Bergen, Norway to study the formation and structure of the
              Iceland-Faroes Front (IFF) and its continuation into the Norwegian Sea. This
              front delineates the boundary between the cold Arctic waters north and east of
              Iceland and the warm waters of the NE Atlantic. It is also a major supply route
              of warm saline water to the Nordic Seas. A Lagrangian study of the inflow of
              warm water along the IFF into the Norwegian Sea will be conducted using a total
              of 60 constant depth RAFOS floats. These will be deployed sequentially from
              Icelandic and Faroese research vessels at the southern entrance to the
              Iceland-Faroe ridge to determine from where the warm waters come, and continue
              their transit north across the ridge and beyond into the Norwegian Sea via the
              IFF. The Norwegian partners will study the spreading of the Arctic Intermediate
              Waters, an expanding water mass that appears to be displacing the Norwegian
              Deep Waters that overflow into the northeast Atlantic. The observations will be
              used together for detailed studies and syntheses of the circulation, and they
              will also be immensely valuable for the many modeling studies of the Nordic
              Seas circulation.
