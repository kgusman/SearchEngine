Abstract    :
              This research project will contribute to the understanding of the ways in which
              political spaces are constructed and of the role that participation of groups
              traditionally marginalized plays in this process. It argues that the
              recognition of the existence of a new world order and of new political spaces,
              located beyond the nation-state, requires us to see political actions as
              involving a multi-layered web of interactions, originating and being
              articulated simultaneously from different sites across a variety of scales. The
              research will question the notion of politics as spatially bounded and
              political space fixed and it will show that a more adequate notion of scale
              requires the recognition of new forms of political action and an expansion of
              the meaning of "political subject." The European Union (EU), as an institution
              operating at the supranational scale, and the process of the EU's eastern
              enlargement  will be used to explore the ways in which women in two accession
              countries, the Czech Republic and Poland, have engaged as political actors in
              the construction of supranational political space. Particular attention will be
              given both to the restrictions on what women can do (through an analysis of
              constraints such as the lack of political culture, legacies of socialist uneven
              development, the limitations of the EU's primarily economic focus, and
              institutional rhetorical restrictions), and to what women do succeed in doing,
              as a result of the new opportunities that have been created by globalizing
              tendencies and by the post-1989 transformations. Through an empirical and
              institutional analysis of processes, actions, and responses by women in the
              matter of the EU and of two different states, this research will provide an
              account of the ways in which women's political participation is mobilized and
              competing interests are negotiated in the process of constructing political
              space. This cross-national study will apply a multi-method approach and will be
              divided into four stages, (to be carried out simultaneously in the two
              countries: 1) textual analysis of documents reflecting preparation for the EU
              accession, with special attention to a gender analysis of the EU discourses of
              eastern enlargement; 2) data collection, through approximately 150 individual
              and 12 focus group interviews with women's NGOs, national politicians and
              policy-makers in each of the study countries, EU representatives and EU related
              women's NGOs in Brussels; 3) textual analysis of empirical data using ATLAS ti,
              a computer program for the qualitative analysis of non-numerical and
              unstructured data, and 4) final comparative analysis and theory construction,
              based upon the findings of the first three stages.  

Through an empirical
              and institutional analysis of processes, actions, and responses by women in the
              matter of the EU and of two different states, this research will provide an
              account of the ways in which women's political participation is mobilized and
              competing interests are negotiated in the process of constructing political
              space. In particular this project will: 1) produce the first extensive
              examination of discourses on eastern enlargement and gender and will provide an
              understanding of the ways in which women activists, state politicians, and EU
              representatives use and rework EU and gender discourse as a means of advancing
              their goals and formulating political agendas across various scales
              (supranational, national, local, individual); 2) develop an understanding of
              the ways in which women understand politics and their political activities; of
              how they mobilize, voice their interests, and construct their identities beyond
              the nation-state, and of how these identities translate into the mobilizing
              practices across various scales, and 3) have broader implications insofar as it
              reveals the intricacies of EU negotiations.  The results of the research will
              be publicly available, and this research will in that way increase public
              awareness and stimulate gender debates regarding the benefits and costs of the
              EU eastern enlargement for groups socially and politically marginalized.
