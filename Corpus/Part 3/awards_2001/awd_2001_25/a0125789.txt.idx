Abstract    :
              The International Conference on "Hyperbolic Problems: Theory, Numerics and
              Applications" will be held in CalTech on March 25-29, 2002. The planned Hyp2002
              conference will be the ninth meeting in the bi-annual international series
              which became one of the highest quality and most successful conference series
              in Applied mathematics. There have been many new developments in hyperbolic and
              nonlinear evolution PDEs since the last international hyperbolic PDEs
              conference was held in the US at Stony Brook in 1994. In the 2002 hyperbolic
              PDEs conference to be held at CalTech, we would like to bring young and active
              scientists together with leading researchers from different disciplines to
              address the theoretical, modeling, and computational issues in solving
              hyperbolic PDEs and more generally nonlinear evolution equations arising from
              various application areas. In fact, we would like to broaden further the scope
              of our next hyperbolic conference to include new and exciting research areas
              such as multiscale modeling and simulations (deriving and simulating meso-scale
              or nanoscale material properties in micro devices), geophysical applications
              (wave propagation in random media, coarsening of multi-phase flows through
              multiscale porous media), computational biology and computational chemistry,
              free boundary problems arising from materials science and multi-component fluid
              dynamics (thin films, crystal growth, multi-fluid interfaces, solid/liquid
              interfaces). The conference will provide a forum to exchange and to stimulate
              new ideas from different disciplines, and to formulate new challenging problems
              that will have important physical and industrial impacts.  Theoretical and
              numerical studies of hyperbolic problems have made tremendous impact in the
              developments of US economy and technology. Many high-resolution methods
              developed in the hyperbolic community have helped design faster airplanes, new
              materials, and improve our space exploration program. The hyperbolic conference
              series and its proceedings have become a focal point for active research in a
              growing field, where theory, numerics and applications complement each other.
              The earlier conferences were focused more on theoretical aspects of hyperbolic
              conservation laws. As computers became more and more powerful in the late
              eighties and the nineties, many effective numerical methods have been developed
              in simulating hyperbolic systems arising in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics
              applications. The hyperbolic meetings in this series have been very successful
              in steering the development of new high-resolution algorithms for solving
              complex physical systems. Many of these developments found new applications
              outside their traditional area of Computational Fluid Dynamics, including
              materials science, multiphase/multicomponent flows, combustion/detonation,
              flows with free boundary, geometrically based motions for image processing and
              more. We believe that hosting such a high level conference in the US will
              greatly benefit the US scientists working in this general area. It is
              especially helpful in educating our graduate students and postdocs, providing
              them with the opportunity to be in touch with the leading experts working on
              the frontier of this field. We will take several measures to attract young
              scientists. An effort will be made to increase the number of women
