Basaltic volcanism is
              most typically thought to produce effusion of lava, with the most explosive
              manifestations ranging from mild Strombolian activity to more energetic fire
              fountain eruptions. However, some basaltic eruptions are now recognized as
              extremely violent, i.e. generating widespread phreatomagmatic, subplinian and
              Plinian fall deposits. These eruptions are particularly dangerous because the
              ascent rate of basaltic magma prior to eruption can be very rapid (giving
              warning times as little as a few hours) and because their precursors may be
              ignored or misunderstood. The main question addressed in this proposal is: what
              are the conditions that cause basaltic magma to adopt an eruption style more
              typical of chemically evolved, highly viscous magma? Possible mechanisms
              (acting singly, or in concert) are: (1) interaction between magma and water,
              (ii) very rapid ascent producing a delayed onset of degassing then
              exceptionally rapid "runaway" vesiculation at shallow levels in the conduit,
              (iii) microlite crystallization and degassing of the magma during ascent
              leading to increased viscosity. Our goal is to establish the triggering
              mechanism for the Plinian phase of the 1886 Tarawera eruption. This proposal
              will test the hypothesis that this phase was a consequence of either rheologic
              changes during magma ascent that accompanied early (pre-fragmentation)
              interaction between the basaltic melt and water-bearing rhyolitic units forming
              the conduit walls or late-stage magma water interaction.
