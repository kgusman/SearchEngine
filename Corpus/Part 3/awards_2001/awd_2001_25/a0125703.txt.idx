Abstract    :
              0125703 Wagner	 	 This award is to Case Western Reserve University (Lead
              Institution) to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The
              proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program
              Solicitation (NSF 0179).  Partners The partners in the proposed effort
              include: Case Western Reserve University (Lead Institution), Cleveland Clinic
              Foundation, Inc., KAL Equity Capital Fund, Metro Health Medical Center,
              Nortech-Northeast Ohio Technology Coalition, Ohio Innovation Fund, Seven Roien
              Funds, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Edison Biotechnology, Inc., CID
              Equity Partners, Enterprise Development Inc.   Proposed Activities The award
              has the following activities:  (1) internships for local high school students
              to work at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Bio Technology
              Park, (2) academic degree programs for undergraduate students to take one
              semester of bioengineering and management and internships for post graduates as
              part of the master's degree, (3) research activities in bioengineering or
              biomedical design where students design a product plus a business plan for its
              commercialization, (4) technology transfer with the use of a new incubator
              activity.   Proposed Innovation The goal of the effort is to change the
              culture in Northeast Ohio to promote vibrant entrepreneurship by attracting
              young people to biotechnology, creating new biomedical undergraduate and
              graduate entrepreneur track degree programs that combine engineering and
              management studies, funding for biology-related entrepreneurs for early
              evaluation of product concepts and commercialization, and mentoring for
              entrepreneurs by successful business partners.   Potential Economic
              Impact The award will allow the Northeast Ohio region to apply its
              considerable academic research and education strengths to entrepreneurial
              endeavors that will generate economic development.  The goal is for the region
              to become one of the top ten regions for biomedical industry employment by the
              year 2010.  Potential Societal Impact Young people will be recruited for
              careers in biotechnology and be given education in both engineering and
              management to prepare them to become entrepreneurs to lead the new
              biotechnology economy that will be one of the top ten in the nation by 2010. 
              The emphasis on recruit and education of under-represented minorities is a
              major societal benefit.
