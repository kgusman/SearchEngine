Understanding magma genesis in continental arcs is
              difficult because contamination in the mantle source area and contamination of
              mantle-derived magmas by assimilation of lithospheric mantle or crustal rocks
              during ascent and emplacement produce similar geochemical characteristics.  We
              have been studying the trans-Mexican volcanic belt (TMVB) in order to constrain
              these processes. We feel our previous work has shown that 187Os/188Os is an
              excellent proxy for assimilation, the geochemistry of samples with low
              187Os/188Os (0.13-0.15) is primarily the result of source contamination,
              whereas geochemistry of samples with high 187Os/188Os (0.15-0.45) is the result
              of a more complex history that includes assimilation. The ability to decipher
              different inputs into arc magmas offers an opportunity to couple other
              elemental and isotopic systems into this framework to help unravel different
              inputs from source contamination and assimilation. We propose further study, of
              continental arc volcanism along the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt, whereby we
              utilize a combined approach of major and trace elements with Os, Pb, Sr and O
              isotopic analysis on whole rock or olivine and magnetite mineral separates of
              previously characterized samples, together with new samples from key
              localities. These data will be used to constrain the relative importance of
              source vs. crustal contamination for different components and isotopic systems
              in magma genesis across this arc. Specifically, we will examine: 1) The
              relative roles of mantle source contamination versus crustal contamination in
              basaltic magmas within individual fields and across the entire Mexican arc from
              west to east. 2) Determine whether volcanic fields (Palma Sola) in eastern
              Mexico are related to subduction of the Cocos plate or are part of the eastern
              alkalic province, which is unrelated to subduction.
