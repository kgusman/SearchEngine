Abstract    :
              Zhao, Li

The focus of this proposal is to develop a high-resolution
              tomography method for seismic arrays. Resolution to sub-array structure is
              enhanced by inverting the phase and amplitude variations between adjacent
              stations, rather than at individual stations, in order to minimize biases
              caused by uncertainties in lateral heterogeneities far away from the array.
              Frechet kernels of the data are calculated by coupled normal-mode summation so
              that all finite-frequency effects are accounted for with no high-frequency or
              averaging approximations. A new traveling-wave method will also be developed to
              calculate exact kernels near stations. Asymptotic Legendre functions are used
              to express waves from the source to sub-array heterogeneity (scatterer), but
              exact Legendre functions are adopted for waves from the scatterer to the
              station.


The tomography method is being developed for the Southern Africa
              Seismic Array, deployed to study the Kaapvaal craton, and 3-D inversions are
              conducted for upper-mantle anisotropic structure. Data are measured for surface
              and upper-mantle body waves at an average of 50 three-component stations from
              51 teleseismic events. The result will shed new light on the conflicting
              features in some of the recent regional models, such as the presence of an
              oceanic-type low-velocity zone beneath the craton and shear-wave anisotropy.
              The multi-station, full-wave method developed here is also well suited to serve
              the need of the upcoming USArray. With its proposed average spacing of about 70
              km between adjacent stations, this method will be able to provide a nearly
              uniform lateral resolution of about 50 km in the upper mantle over the entire
              continental United States.
