Abstract    :
              This project seeks to characterize the entire range of
Arabidopsis proteins
              that are regulated by interaction with 14-3-3 proteins; to identify
components
              from metabolic and signal transduction pathways that utilize 14-3-3
              regulators,
and to address fundamental aspects of 14-3-3 function in plants.
              14-3-3s have emerged as
critical regulators of important and diverse cellular
              processes that extend to every
tissue and organ. Indeed, 14-3-3s appear to be
              intrinsically necessary for regulatory
events that are absolutely crucial to
              normal growth and development in many species, and
especially in plants.
              Initial searches of the Arabidopsis genome predict that 14-3-3s
interact with
              fully 10 to 20 percent of the Arabidopsis gene products.
The most recognized
              of 14-3-3 activities involve protein kinases, phosphorylation
events and
              signal transduction pathways involved in growth and development, with
              one
underlying theme being that 14-3-3s bind to specific phosphorylated client
              proteins in
order to influence the regulation of the target activity. The
              goals of the present
project are to identify in the Arabidopsis genome client
              proteins that possess 14-3-3
docking sites and to assay the interaction
              strength of the potential docking site against
the family of 14-3-3 proteins
              in order to provide a tested, predictive algorithm for
determining of the
              spectrum of 14-3-3 interactions that should be expected for each
              client
protein. These data, combined with emerging data from 14-3-3 knockouts
              and 14-3-3 isoform
expression patterns, should provide key insights into the
              potential regulatory functions
of the 14-3-3 signal mediating molecules, and a
              central, fully characterized database for
predicting 14-3-3 mediated signaling
              in diverse pathways.
By highlighting potential regulatory sites across diverse
              gene families and metabolic
pathways, this project will provide an integrating
              effect on the many projects identifying
specific functional aspects of
              Arabidopsis gene families. As genes are functionally
characterized, the 14-3-3
              client database will provide immediate predictions of
phosphorylation and
              14-3-3 dependent regulation that will accelerate the understanding of
the
              regulation of many gene families and metabolic and signaling pathways.
