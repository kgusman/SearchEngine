Abstract    :
              This research project has two thrusts.  First, the research aims to  develop a
              set of benchmarking and diagnostic modes based on queuing, material flow, and
              stochastic optimization models for generic manufacturing cells.  These will be
              used to evaluate the current performance of a system relative to both external
              (industry) and internal (theoretical) standards.  Second, the  research will
              use models to classify improvement areas into broad categories and use these to
              develop a fundamentally new framework for organizing experiential information
              related to the design and improvement of cellular production systems.  The
              ultimate goal is to create a prototype web-based knowledge management tool that
              will diagnose problems, suggest improvement options, and accumulate and
              classify information for future shared use by the organization.  In theory,
              modern information technology makes it possible to place information previously
              available only to experts in the hands of users throughout the firm.  But
              converting data to useful information presumes an ability to capture, organize,
              and link knowledge to the practical concerns of decision-makers.  Evolving
              methods of artificial intelligence provide exciting new ways to search and
              retrieve text-based information, based largely on matching documents to user
              interests on the basis of keywords.  However, such an approach is not entirely
              suited to many production environments because users do not necessarily know
              what keywords they should be interested in to find help with their problems. 
              What is needed is a more proactive system for diagnosing problems and leading
              users to relevant information.    The need for knowledge creation and sharing
              systems is becoming even more crucial as manufacturing systems emphasize highly
              customized products and quick response to customer demands.  Agile
              manufacturing relies on production in small scale, often modular, flexible
              manufacturing cells that use multi-functional machinery and cross-trained
              workers.  While there has been some recent modeling research into the design
              and control of agile manufacturing systems, almost nothing has been done on
              linking models to the information needs of managers trying to evaluate and
              improve their systems.  This research will develop models of cellular systems
              and use them to establish a framework for organizing information in a knowledge
              management system to support the process of continual improvement in agile
              manufacturing systems
