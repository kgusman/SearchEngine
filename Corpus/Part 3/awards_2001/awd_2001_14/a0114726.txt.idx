Abstract    :
              Brassinosteroids are growth-promoting hormones involved in modulating plant
              plasticity in response to changes in the environment. Previous studies of
              brassinosteroids have concentrated on either the metabolic or reception
              pathways for these hormones. A novel gene affecting brassinosteroid responses
              in plants, CYP72B1, has recently been identified. This gene appears to be
              involved in brassinosteroid inactivation rather than biosynthesis or perception
              acting as a brassinosteroid hydroxylase that catabolizes the most active form
              of the hormone, brassinolide, into an inactive form, 26-hydroxybrassinolide. By
              regulating the active levels of brassinolide in certain tissues or at certain
              times, CYP72B1 may be acting as a modulator of brassinosteroid responses during
              plant development. One hypothesis is that CYP72B1 uses brassinolide as an
              enzyme substrate generating the less-active brassinosteroid,
              26-hydroxybrassinolide. Heterologous expression of CYP72B1 in yeast coupled
              with feeding experiments using radiolabeled brassinolide will test whether
              CYP72B1 uses brassinolide as an enzyme substrate. Physiological analysis will
              also be used to further characterize 26-hydroxybrassinolide activity. A second
              hypothesis is that CYP72B1 expression affects growth in Arabidopsis by
              regulating brassinolide levels. A T-DNA knockout mutation in the CYP72B1 gene
              will allow a detailed analysis of the role this gene plays in development. A
              third hypothesis is that CYP72B1 activity is regulated transcriptionally and
              post translationally at the tissue specific level. RT-PCR experiments show that
              CYP72B1 transcripts accumulate greater in the rosettes vsersus the hypocotyls
              of developing seedlings. CYP72B1 transcript accumulation measurements will be
              expanded to many different tissues of both juvenile and adult plants. CYP72B1
              translational fusions with reporter genes will also be used to examine CYP72B1
              protein levels in different tissues during plant development. Together, this
              research will increase the understanding of CYP72B1's role in modulating
              brassinosteroid levels and perception during plant development.  In addition to
              the training of one graduate student and one postdoctoral fellow, several
              undergraduates are likely to participate in this project. Findings from this
              research will be incorporated, when appropriate, into an undergraduate
              laboratory course on DNA manipulation taught by the Principal Investigator,
              Professor Michael Neff.
