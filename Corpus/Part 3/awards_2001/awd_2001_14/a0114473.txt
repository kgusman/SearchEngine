     The investigator uses mechanical models to investigate
              the
mechanisms involved in tumor encapsulation, multiple lobe
formation, and
              transcapsular spread.  Mass and momentum balance
equations are written for the
              normal cells, neoplastic cells, the
extracellular matrix (ECM) on which they
              are anchored, and the
interstitial fluid in which they are bathed.  This
              system is
closed by suitable constitutive relations for the mass supply,
the
              partial stress tensor, and the momentum supply of each
constituent.  The
              former is defined on the basis of
phenomenological observations of tumor cell
              growth and the latter
is based on the mechanical properties of each phase. 
              The model
equations, consisting of a set nonlinear conservation and
evolution
              equations, are analyzed using asymptotic analysis,
bifurcation analysis, and
              perturbation theory in order to
quantify the relative importance of chemical
              processes (such as
ECM production and degradation) and mechanical properties
              of the
tissue (such as ECM density and stiffness) in influencing
              capsule
formation.  A further objective is to characterize the
bifurcation
              that leads to multiple lobe formation.  Through
analysis and simulation of the
              model, the investigator aims to
discover which factors (mechanical and
              chemical) determine
successful capsule formation and to quantify their
              influence.
     The mechanisms by which a tumor becomes encapsulated as
              a
continuum of cells or as several lobes of different sizes,
separated by
              connective tissue, is an interesting, important, and
unsolved phenomenon in
              tumor biology.  In fact, the presence (or
absence) of a dense capsule
              surrounding a neoplastic mass is a
major determinant of prognosis and the
              ultimate survival of the
host.  Despite the importance of capsule formation,
              little is
known about the process by which capsules arise.  The
incestigator
              develops a mathematical modeling framework that
describes tumor growth,
              encapsulation, multiple lobe formation,
and transcapsular spread based on the
              physical forces and
cellular interactions involved.  The specific aims are to
              use
mechanical models to assist in understanding i) the role tumor
cell,
              normal cell, and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in
capsule formation,
              ii) the effects of tumor induced ECM
production and degradation on the
              formation of tumor capsules,
iii) the role of tissue properties such as ECM
              density and
stiffness in slowing or impeding the process of
              tumor
encapsulation, and iv) the bifurcation that allows a
              simple
encapsulated continuum of cells to make the transition to
              a
multi-nodular form.  There are implications for clinical diagnosis
as well
              as for prognosis.
