              IBN-0114505:  Physiological Role and Phylogenetic Diversity of Termite Gut
              Symbionts Principal Investigator:  John A. Breznak, Michigan State
              University  Termites are important decomposers of earth's major form of
              biomass -- lignocellulosic plant material and residues derived from it, e.g.
              humus. In order to thrive on such relatively refractory, nitrogen-poor food
              resources, termites are aided by a diverse community of gut microbial
              symbionts. The nature of the gut microbes, and their role in termite nutrition
              and vitality, has been an ongoing focus of research in the PI's laboratory for
              many years. Research supported by the current award is largely an outgrowth of
              a breakthrough, which led to two major discoveries during the previous funding
              period. The breakthrough was the isolation in pure culture of a
              long-recognized, major, and morphologically distinct, but hitherto elusive,
              component of the termite gut microbial community, i.e. spirochetes. The
              discoveries were: (a) the recognition of them as novel species of Treponema
              capable of acetate production from a variety of substrates, including H2+CO2;
              and (b) the demonstration of nitrogenase structural genes (nifH) and N2
              fixation in these (and subsequently in free-living) spirochetes. Inasmuch as
              microbially-produced acetate supports up to 100% of the daily energy
              requirement of termites, and N2 fixation by gut microbes can supply up to 60%
              of the nitrogen for termite growth, the importance of spirochetes in termite
              nutrition was becoming clearer. Moreover, as neither H2/CO2-acetogenesis nor N2
              fixation had ever been recognized in spirochetes before, these discoveries were
              also providing new insight into the metabolic diversity of these fascinating
              bacteria.  A combination of physiological, biochemical, and molecular
              biological methods will now be used to explore these metabolic activities in
              greater detail. We seek to identify factors affecting their expression and
              activity, and to assess the importance of spirochetes to H2/CO2-acetogenesis
              and N2 fixation in situ. Cooperative and antagonistic interactions of
              spirochetes with other members of the gut microbiota will also be examined,
              including: the provision of folate compounds (required for growth of termite
              gut spirochetes) by other gut microbes that utilize spirochete products, e.g.
              acetate oxidizers; and antagonisms between H2/CO2-acetogenic spirochetes and
              H2-consuming methanogens - two groups of microbes competing for the same energy
              source. Studies will also be done to test the hypothesis that many of the
              (non-spirochetal) gut microbes colonizing the microoxic region of hindguts near
              the epithelium are microaerophiles that have previously escaped isolation in
              pure culture, because they will not grow in air or under anoxia. It is
              hypothesized that such microaerophiles are acetate-oxidizers that consume
              inwardly diffusing O2, thereby rendering the luminal region of the gut anoxic
              for the fermentative production (by spirochetes and protozoa) of more acetate.
              This latter effort is likely to reveal new principles about life under hypoxia,
              a pervasive but poorly studied condition experienced by many organisms in our
              biosphere. This research project will involve graduate students and a
              postdoctoral and, hence, will expand the base of scientists trained to explore
              two of the most salient features of the microbial world - its enormous, but
              poorly understood and largely untapped diversity, and its importance to
              macrobial life on our planet.
