Abstract    :
              SES 0114672 Judith Reppy/John Cloud, Cornell University The Cold War and the
              Rise of GIS  Most of the fundamental technologies of contemporary geography
              were devised in the last half of the 20th century and were shaped by the
              exigencies and opportunities of the Cold War. The technologies and their data
              sources were initially often deeply secret. Out of this has emerged a large and
              complex industry of geographic and allied technologies, at the center of which
              are geographic information systems (GIS), that integrate geo-referenced data by
              techniques of overlay.  Prior research by the co-PI suggests that GIS emerged
              from the convergence of the geographic sciences during the Cold War. This new
              system of technologies and practices developed not despite, but rather through
              a complex and enormously productive system of classified knowledge production
              that transformed American scientific institutions and practices, but also
              thoroughly disguised the nature and sources of the exchanges. Standard
              histories of GIS acknowledge earlier initiatives in overlay technique, but do
              not pursue them. Where, how, when, and by whom did geographic integration by
              overlay develop? How did overlay change from analog to digital systems, and how
              did these systems transfer to civilian use? And why have these earlier stages
              of the history of GIS been ignored? Integration by overlay has complex roots in
              prewar regional planning, but the major part of the analog-to-digital
              transition occurred in near-real-time mapping systems using reconnaissance
              imagery that was among the most closely guarded secrets of the U.S. government.
              These Military Geographic Information Systems (MGIS) lost their initial "M" to
              emerge from classified programs as-GIS. The chronologies and emphasis of
              standard histories of GIS constitute part of the surviving cover story.  This
              project explores the history of GIS within a framework informed by science and
              technology studies and the literature on dual use. Through interviews, archival
              research, and examination of previously classified or deliberately suppressed
              records the project reveals a history of GIS that is longer, darker, and
              altogether more interesting that previous  accounts have suggested. The project
              advances the geographic sciences by illuminating a significant period in GIS
              development that has been overlooked or ignored. Examining these technological
              transitions in grounded detail provides an important case study in Cold War
              science and technology. And it discloses early applications of overlay linked
              to public involvement in analysis and planning with important implications for
              contemporary initiatives to broaden public participation in GIS.  Products of
              the study include presentations at appropriate conferences, publications in
              peer-reviewed journals in the disciplines of geographic information science and
              studies of science and technology, a web publication with historically
              significant data sets from the "pre-history" of GIS; and an augmented essay for
              the Exploratory Essays Initiative of the "History of Twentieth Century
              Cartography Project."  This research recovers one of the most important stories
              of the secret geography of the Cold War
