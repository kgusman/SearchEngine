Abstract    :
              One of the main functions of the plant cell vacuole is to store allelochemicals.
              These allelochemicals act as a chemical defense mechanism that helps protect
              the cell from attacks by other organisms. Allelochemical production presents
              somewhat of a dilemma for the cell since in order to be effective the plant
              must produce these compounds in relatively high concentrations. However, since
              many of these allelochemicals are non-specific toxins, high concentrations in
              the cell may result in autotoxicity. The plant cells appear to have resolved
              this dilemma by first conjugating the allelochemical to a water-soluble
              molecule such as glutathione (GSH) or glucose and sequestering the conjugate in
              the vacuole. These conjugates may be recognized and transported into the
              vacuole by a subclass of ATP-binding cassette transporters known as multidrug
              resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). In order to provide more information
              regarding the vacuolar transport of allelochemicals, this project has three
              general objectives. Objective 1 is to determine if glucose or GSH conjugates of
              trans-cinnamic acid (CA), para-coumaric acid (PC) and salicylic acid (SA) are
              localized in the vacuole of Arabidopsis cells. This will be determined through
              in vivo labeling techniques and TLC/HPLC analysis of vacuolar contents. CA, PC
              and SA were chosen for this study because they are allelochemicals found in
              virtually all plants. Objective 2 is to develop a simple method for the
              synthesis of the glucose conjugates of SA, CA and PC. For these compounds,
              these are the most common conjugates found in plant cells and a facile,
              high-yield synthesis will provide useful substrates for detailed vacuolar
              transport studies. Objective 3 is to determine how the vacuolar transport of
              both glucose and GSH conjugates changes during a defense response. A defense
              response will be initiated in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures by the
              addition of a fungal elicitor or known signal molecules of plant defense (e.g.
              SA, ethylene, jasmonate, superoxide, and H2O2). Arabidopsis cell suspension
              cultures will be used for this study because of the molecular tools available
              and the ease in which the treatments can be added. Changes in the transcription
              of Arabidopsis MRPs (AtMRPs) in response to the treatments will be followed
              through dot-blot analysis using the AtMRP expressed sequence tags as probes.
              Vacuolar transport activity using both glucose and GSH conjugates will be
              compared to the changes in AtMRP transcription and measured using isolated
              tonoplast vesicles from the treated cells. These changes in transport activity
              will also be compared to changes that occur in allelochemical production and
              conjugation during a defense response. If vacuolar sequestration of
              allelochemicals is an important aspect of a plant's defense response, then
              changes in allelochemical production and conjugation should be accompanied by
              changes in vacuolar transport. The results from these studies should provide
              considerable insight into the importance of vacuolar sequestration of
              allelochemicals during a plant cell's defense response. In the future,
              manipulation of vacuolar sequestration through biotechnology may be able to
              enhance the plants own natural defense mechanisms, which would have great
              agricultural significance with regard to pest control.
