Abstract    :
              Abstract CTS-0114190 N. Jensen, University of California - Davis  An
              International Conference on Computational Nanoscience is planned for the period
              between March 18-21, 2001 in Hilton Head, South Carolina.  Its main purpose is
              to bring together experts from the fields of computational biology, chemistry
              and material sciences in combination with their industrial end users.  It is to
              be run in parallel (space and time), with the fourth International Conference
              on Modeling and Simulation of Microsystems.  It is hoped that maximum synergy
              will be obtained in this manner.  In particular, emphasis will be given to the
              recent advances in molecular dynamics and ab initio methods, and to their
              applications to the design of semi-conductors, drugs and biodiagnostics.  The
              interaction of speakers, researchers, students and private sector
              representative will result in the interchange of ideas and the stimulation and
              technical innovation. The conference is co-funded by both the Division of
              Chemical and Transport Systems and The Division of Materials Research.
