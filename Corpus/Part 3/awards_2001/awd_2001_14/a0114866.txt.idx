              0114866 Meinke    PROJECT SUMMARY  This project will establish a
              foundation for identifying every Arabidopsis gene with an essential function
              during seed development.  This information is central to the Arabidopsis 2010
              Project and to identifying the minimal gene set required for growth and
              development of a model plant.  The project will focus on genes that give a
              visible seed phenotype when disrupted by mutation.  The network of genes chosen
              for analysis is therefore not defined by shared biochemical or molecular
              features but rather by the fact that they are essential.  Arabidopsis contains
              an estimated 500 such EMB genes required for normal seed development and
              another 200 genes required for normal seed pigmentation.  The approach outlined
              here is to coordinate the collection, analysis, and presentation of information
              on more than half of these genes based on cloning of mutant alleles. 
              Information on essential genes and the corresponding mutants will be obtained
              from a variety of public and private sources and synthesized for efficient use
              by the community.  The resulting insights into biological functions of these
              diverse genes will complement research in other labs on the biochemical
              activities of specific gene products.  The result will be an integrated view of
              essential gene functions within a cellular, organismal, and evolutionary
              context.    Project objectives are to: (1) use a combination of forward and
              reverse genetics to approach saturation for cloned EMB genes;  (2) standardize
              phenotypic characterization of the corresponding mutants; (3) collect related
              information on seed pigment mutants;  (4) make seeds for all mutant lines
              available through ABRC;  (5) understand the functions of these genes in growth
              and development;  (6) determine through expression studies and comparative
              sequence analysis why these genes are essential;  (7) integrate this
              information into a simple but robust database with a format compatible with
              TAIR; (8) establish a model for public release of private sector resources; and
              (9) develop outreach and training programs that complement research efforts in
              Arabidopsis functional genomics.  Project deliverables include public access to
              synthesized information and seed stocks for 500 mutants defective in 300
              different EMB genes; similar information for another 100 pigment mutants
              defective in 75 genes; valuable expression data for genes active in young seeds
              (wild type and selected mutants); and a database that should serve as a model
              for analyzing and presenting information on large collections of mutants.  The
              project web page (www.seedgenes.org) will be linked through TAIR
              (www.arabidopsis.org).  Release of the first version of the database is
              scheduled for March 2002.  Profiles of the first 100 essential genes examined
              in detail will be presented at that time.    This project builds upon an
              existing collaboration between Oklahoma State University and Syngenta that has
              over the past 4 years resulted in identification of 350 tagged emb mutants and
              preliminary sequence data for about 200 of these mutants.  This represents a
              significant corporate investment into a project that would be difficult and
              expensive to duplicate with federal funding.  The current proposal includes
              substantial public release of private materials with minimal restrictions and
              provides a mechanism for collecting and analyzing community-wide information on
              essential genes.  Such efforts are needed at the start of the 2010 Project to
              focus attention on genes with important biological functions.
