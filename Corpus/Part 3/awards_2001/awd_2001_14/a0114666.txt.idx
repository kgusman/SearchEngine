Abstract    :
              Widely distributed in animals, plants and microbes, O-glycoside hydrolases (EC
              3.2.1.-) are enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of chemical bonds between two
              or more carbohydrates or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety.
              Responding to the challenge of the 2010 Project to identify the function of all
              Arabidopsis thaliana genes within the next decade, this collaborative research
              will focus on approximately 75 members of two related families of glycoside
              hydrolases (http://www.biol.vt.edu/faculty/esen/glycosidase.lab.html and
              http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~pedro/CAZY/). Family 1 includes beta -glucosidases (EC
              3.2.1.21) and myrosinases (EC 3.2.3.1), which function in higher plants in
              chemical defense against herbivores and pathogens, lignin biosynthesis, and
              plant growth and development. Family 35 contains the beta -galactosidases (EC
              3.2.1.23), which play key roles in fruit ripening, flower senescence,
              mobilization of carbohydrate reserves, and galactolipid turnover. To date, the
              precise biochemical roles of only three of these Arabidopsis hydrolases are
              known with certainty.   The purpose of this multidisciplinary collaborative
              research is to assign biological functions to beta-glucosidases and
              beta-galactosidases encoded by the Arabidopsis genome. After using phylogenetic
              analysis to identify subfamilies that contain closely related enzymes, cDNAs
              encoding each target hydrolase will be obtained. Each hydrolase will then be
              overexpressed in foreign host (e.g. yeast and bacteria) cells and purified to
              ascertain its biological function by measuring its enzymatic activity toward a
              wide range of natural glycosidic substrates isolated primarily from Arabidopsis
              and related crucifers for this purpose. In parallel studies, three-dimensional
              structures of selected subfamily representatives will be determined by homology
              modeling and x-ray diffraction, providing novel insights into how these
              hydrolases recognize and bind their substrates. This information will be of
              paramount importance in future research to alter the substrate specificity of
              Family 1 and Family 35 hydrolases for biotechnological purposes, including
              biomass conversion and improvements in anti-herbivore defenses and fruit
              ripening.
