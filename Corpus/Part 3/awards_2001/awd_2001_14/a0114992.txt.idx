Abstract    :
              Because of their sessile nature, plants have evolved a wide range of strategies
              to respond to changes in their environment.  For a number of these responses
              plants have co-opted (or co-evolved) systems that are shared with other taxa. 
              However, many of the environmental (both biotic and abiotic) response systems
              plants utilize are apparently specific to plants and are often comprised of
              novel molecular components.  With the recent completion of the Arabidopsis
              genome sequencing project we are now in a unique position to ask fundamental
              questions about the functions of these latter set of regulatory proteins in
              plants.  Of the ~11,000 protein families formed by the 25,498 predicted genes
              of Arabidopsis, only ~150 families appear to be plant-specific.  One of these
              plant-specific families is the NPH3/RPT2 family.  This family, which is
              comprised of 32 novel proteins (for more information about these
              proteins/genes, including GenBank accession numbers, see
              http://www.biosci.missouri.edu/liscum/nph3-rpt2figs.html), was first identified
              with the cloning of NPH3 (NONPHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3) and RPT2 (ROOT
              PHOTOTROPISM 2) - genes identified in screens for mutants with altered
              phototropic responses.  NPH3 and RPT2 function in early phototropic signaling
              and appear to act as modular scaffold proteins to recruit or activate enzymatic
              components of the transduction chains, including the respective photoreceptors
              themselves, mediating phototropic responses. Given the high degree of
              similarity in primary sequence and secondary structure between all members of
              the NPH3/RPT2 family it seems appropriate to hypothesize that these
              plant-specific proteins may act as scaffolds for sensor-containing signaling
              complexes utilized in a variety of abiotic and/or biotic responses.  The major
              goals proposed for this project are to determine mRNA and protein expression
              patterns, and biological functions for each member of the NPH3/RPT2 family. 
              The expression studies are proposed as a means of developing logical and
              focused analyses of loss- and gain-of-function mutants.  In such a way we
              expect to be able to determine what biological processes require the function
              of each member of the NPH3/RPT2 family.  All project data will be publicly
              available through a project database
              (http://www.biosci.missouri.edu/liscum/NPH3-RPT2family.html), as well as The
              Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (http://www.arabidopsis.org/home.html).
               Given the plant-specific and novel nature of the NPH3/RPT2 family, it is
              likely that elucidation of biological functions for the family will represent
              an important step in understanding fundamental aspects of plant growth and
              development.
