Abstract    :
              This IGERT project examines the problem of sequential decision-making as a
              unifying framework for the study of several central topics in cognitive
              science: selective attention, navigation, language processing, and the
              coordination of action in multiple-agent groups.  The overarching question our
              students are trained to investigate is the following: how is it possible for an
              agent to decide what actions to take to achieve long-term goals? We recognize
              that decision-making in complex environments is a sequential process, involving
              a series of episodes in which an agent, based on information available through
              its senses and stored in memory, selects the action appropriate for its goals.
              The problem is made difficult by perceptual uncertainty arising from sensory
              limitations and environmental complexity, by the challenge of sorting through
              the large space of actions available, and by inherent delays in feedback about
              the long-term consequences of actions. A wide variety of fundamental cognitive
              tasks can be cast as sequential decision-making problems. Understanding how
              such problems may be solved will be a critical component of a general theory of
              intelligent behavior in organisms, and will be essential for the design of
              truly intelligent machines. To study these problems, we adopt a comparative
              approach, combining insights from a range of model systems, including humans,
              non-human animals, robots, and intelligent software agents. This
              multidisciplinary framework will enable students to integrate ideas and methods
              from different fields that have been concerned with the study of sequential
              decision-making (psychology, behavioral biology, linguistics, and computer
              science), but that have so far remained largely separate. The training program
              is designed to create a new generation of scientists trained in this
              innovative, multidisciplinary approach. Graduate training will be focused on
              fundamental disciplinary education, a common set of courses focused on the
              sequential decision-making framework, and a strong emphasis on mentored,
              interdisciplinary research activities that span each student's entire graduate
              program.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of
              educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds
              and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career
              demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in
              graduate education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate
              education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that
              transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the
              program, awards are being made to twenty-two institutions for programs that
              collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The
              intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the Directorates for Social,
              Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Computer and Information Science and
              Engineering; Engineering; Biological Sciences; and Education and Human
              Resources.
