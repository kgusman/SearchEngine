Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that the
              phospho-protein adaptor 14-3-3.a controls the reorganization of the gill
              epithelium during salinity acclimation of euryhaline teleosts.  Specifically,
              this project will investigate the mechanisms of osmotic regulation of 14-3-3.a
              at multiple levels (expression, posttranslational regulation, and
              compartmentalization) and its interaction with mitogen-activated protein
              kinases (MAPKs) in the adapting gill epithelium of the euryhaline fish Fundulus
              heteroclitus.  The focus of this project is a detailed investigation of the
              osmotic regulation of 14-3-3.a. This is a critical issue because 14-3-3
              proteins are of general and extraordinary importance for signal transduction
              pathways that are based on phosphorylation. These proteins are a novel type of
              molecular adaptor that modulates interactions among virtually all important
              components involved in environmentally regulated signaling pathways, cell
              differentiation, and cell cycle control (Fu et al., 2000). 14-3-3 proteins
              regulate cellular activity and function by binding and sequestering proteins
              phosphorylated on serine or threonine. These molecules likely control the
              reorganization of gill epithelium during salinity adaptation of euryhaline
              teleosts because 1) protein phosphorylation is a major mechanism of osmosensory
              signal transduction and 2) 14-3-3 proteins are involved in the regulation of
              many mitogenic, ion transport, and cell differentiation pathways.  Substantial
              preliminary data provide a strong foundation for the proposed project and
              represent a comprehensive basis for addressing all aims of this project in
              depth. A cloned and sequenced novel cDNA from the euryhaline fish F.
              heteroclitus (GB AF302039) contains an open reading frame encoding the first
              known 14-3-3 protein from fish that is named 14-3-3.a.  Recent data provide
              clear evidence that the 14-3-3.a gene is strongly induced in gill epithelium of
              F. heteroclitus transferred from seawater (SW) to fresh water (FW).  The
              abundance and activities of the MAPKs ERK, JNK, and p38 in gill epithelium of
              F. heteroclitus transferred from SW to FW and vice versa show that the activity
              of all MAPKs is strongly modulated during salinity acclimation of euryhaline
              fish.  The aims focus on a detailed analysis of the osmotic regulation of
              14-3-3.a in gill epithelium of the euryhaline fish F. heteroclitus: 1) To know
              the profile of osmotic regulation of 14-3-3.a mRNA and protein expression. 2)
              To investigate how osmolality changes affect posttranslational modification of
              14-3-3.a. 3) To know the cellular and subcellular localization of 14-3-3.a and
              how it is osmotically regulated. 4) To determine whether 14-3-3.a interacts
              with MAPKs in the osmotically adapting gill epithelium.  The approach for
              addressing these aims will be based on recombinant DNA methodology; western
              blotting, northern blotting, two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by
              MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation,
              pull-down assays, and kinase assays.  It is anticipated that this project will
              significantly advance the knowledge of cellular osmosensory signal
              transduction.  It will introduce a novel euryhaline fish model to osmosensory
              signal transduction research. Euryhaline fishes have an extrarenal transport
              epithelium the gill epithelium that is directly exposed to the external milieu
              and can be studied in intact animals in vivo. Unlike for mammalian renal cells,
              the osmolality of the medium surrounding fish gill epithelial cells can be
              accurately and instantaneously manipulated in vivo.  This research should
              provide comprehensive insight into the osmotic regulation of 14-3-3.a, an
              excellent candidate molecule for governing many aspects of osmosensory signal
              transduction and cell differentiation in adapting gill epithelial cells of
              euryhaline teleosts exposed to salinity changes.
