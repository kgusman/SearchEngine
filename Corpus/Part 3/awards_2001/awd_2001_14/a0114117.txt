Abstract    :
              The network of one-carbon (C1) reactions provides C1 units for use in
              biosynthesis. It is crucial to plant metabolism, but many of the network's
              enzymes are known poorly or not at all. Accordingly, functions will be
              determined for genes that putatively encode: 10-formyl-THF deformylase,
              sarcosine oxidase, formamidase, 5-formyl-THF cycloligase, S-formylglutathione
              hydrolase, glutamate forminotransferase, methionine g-lyase, and organellar
              forms of 5,10-methylene-THF dehydrogenase. For all these genes "determining
              function" means finding the biochemical activities and subcellular location of
              the encoded proteins; for the first five it means in addition isolating
              Arabidopsis knockout mutants and determining the effects of the mutations on C1
              metabolism using NMR, mass spectral, and biochemical procedures. GenBank
              numbers for the network of C1 genes are at
              http://www.hos.ufl.edu/meteng/1Cpage1.html. This website will be used to post
              research results as they become available, as well as a catalog of the
              full-length cDNAs, antibodies, and other resources generated in the project. 
              This website will be linked to the central 2010 project site when it is
              established. Results will also be presented at meetings and published.  This
              research will meet 2010 project objectives by assigning biochemical and
              metabolic functions to most of the unexpected, unexplained, and unexplored
              genes in plant C1 metabolism. The broader impact will be three-fold. First, on
              crop improvement. Many efforts to genetically engineer plants for human benefit
              involve changes to C1 metabolism, making it vital to understand C1 metabolism
              so as to engineer it successfully. Second, on basic plant biochemistry, because
              C1 metabolism is perhaps the least well understood area of plant primary
              metabolism despite its central position in processes such as photorespiration,
              lignification, and alkaloid synthesis. Third, on biochemistry in general,
              because the plant C1 metabolic network is special, not merely a minor variation
              on those in yeast, liver, or bacteria.
