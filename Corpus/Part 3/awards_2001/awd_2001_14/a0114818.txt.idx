Abstract    :
              0114818 Pickett Discovery or fabrication of new materials with unexpected and
              fascinating properties is a continuing, perhaps accelerating, process.  A very
              good example of such a discovery within the past year is that the ferromagnet
              UGe2 becomes superconducting while remaining magnetic.  This type of
              coexistence was not supposed to happen according to Ginzburg in 1957, and it
              had not been questioned seriously until the last couple of years (RuSr2GdCu2O8 
              has related properties for quite different reasons).  Another example is the
              spin glass compound Y2Mo2O7 which is structurally ordered whereas before its
              discovery structural disorder was expected to be required for spin glass
              behavior.  Such discoveries attract great interest among materials
              physicists, and seem invariably to impact strongly subsequent developments in
              the field, viz. superconductivity, Kondo effect, quantum Hall effect.  In each
              of the materials mentioned above, the unanticipated behavior could not have
              arisen in simpler (either structurally, or in terms of interactions) systems,
              because the requisite degrees of freedom are not present.  Coexistence of
              superconductivity and magnetism in RuSr2GdCu2O8 , although not at all
              understood, is allowed only because of the separation of magnetic and
              superconducting layers; in Y2Mo2O7 it is thought probable that spin glassiness
              results from a combination of ferromagnetic exchange coupling, strong single
              ion anisotropy, and frustrating topology of the pyrochlore sublattice that
              hosts the magnetic Mo ions.  This theoretical project is concerned primarily
              with behavior that involves the spin degrees of freedom in an essential way,
              and in progressing toward a first principles theory.  Novel magnetic phenomena
              keep appearing: two areas that concern this grant directly are spin gap
              behavior in low dimensional insulators and half metallic behavior in
              conductors.  The case of CaV4O9 (CaVO) is impressive in the speed in which its
              behavior has been solved within a five year time span.  CaVO has a 1/5-th
              depleted 'square' lattice of V ions with S=1/2, and displays spin gap (or
              quantum spin liquid) behavior, the first two dimensional (2D) material to do
              so.  Through a combination of experimental probes and applications of several
              theoretical methods from a variety of groups, the behavior of CaVO is
              understood.  The objective of the grant is to obtain a microscopic
              description, based on first principles (parameter-free) methods, that is
              detailed enough to provide an understanding of the observed behavior.  Once the
              description becomes good enough, the theory may be used in a predictive fashion
              to determine computationally, rather than experimentally, what a material's
              behavior will be.  Becasue it is possible to 'look into' the simulation in a
              much more detailed way than is possible experimentally, this approach leads to
              insights that are not available otherwise, and will enable materials physicists
              to design new materials that have desired properties. %%%     Theoretical
              research will be conducted on a variety of complex materials of current
              interest in order to understand their properties from a fundamental approach
              and, at the same time, to develop techniques which will provide the tools
              needed to design materials with specified propoerties. ***
