Abstract    :
              This IGERT award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate
              training program of education and research in the development of a virtual
              tribology system for future powertrains, which are the power-delivery systems
              of automobiles and aircraft.  The current development of a powertrain
              tribological system is time-consuming, requiring integration of new materials,
              engine technologies, trial-and-error, laboratory experimentation and extensive
              field-testing.  The vision is to shorten the development time by developing a
              virtual powertrain through advanced computer modeling that simulates the
              interfacial interactions among critical machine elements.  The development of
              such technology requires new engineers and scientists with cross-disciplinary
              training.  The traditional engineering Ph.D. training model based on one
              advisor and a single topic does not work well in this new paradigm.  Creating
              Ph.D.s who are educated in a multidisciplinary environment represents the
              educational focus of this IGERT program.  Because of the need for multiscale
              modeling and multidisciplinary research, an aggressive education plan requiring
              the creation of a multidisciplinary learning/research environment, electronic
              education, industrial collaboration, international outreach and faculty
              re-education will be an integral part of the current program.  This program is
              a joint effort among faculty members in chemistry, chemical engineering, civil
              engineering, computer engineering, materials science and mechanical
              engineering, as well as physics.  With the successful development of
              virtualization technology, it is hoped to educate a new generation of engineers
              and scientists who have strong technical skill and are proficient in
              multidisciplinary collaboration and in working with computer simulations of
              complex systems.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the
              challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
              multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal
              skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to
              catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new,
              innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment
              for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
              In the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-two
              institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and
              engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award
              reside in the Directorates for Engineering; Computer and Information Science
              and Engineering; Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and Education and Human
              Resources.
