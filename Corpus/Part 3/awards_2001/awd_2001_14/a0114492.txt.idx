Abstract    :
              SES 0114492 Sheldon Smith, Metropolitan State College Denver Causation and the
              Rule of Law  At least since the time of David Hume, philosophers -- including
              such notable ones as Immanuel Kant and Bertrand Russell -- as well as certain
              physicists -- including Ernst Mach and Gustav Kirchhoff -- have wondered about
              the connection between the laws of nature and the relation of cause and effect.
              This project contributes to that discussion in a way that remains closer to the
              content of actual physical theories than most of the literature on the
              subject. After criticizing various standard accounts of lawhood, this project
              delineates three different classes of laws of physics. The distinction between
              these three different classes of laws is arrived at by an examination of the
              structure of classical continuum mechanics, but it is shown that these classes
              appear in other physical theories, such as Quantum Mechanics, as well. It is
              further shown that what is known as the Green's function (for a differential
              operator) is the mathematical locus of causal claims within physics. Once the
              causal relation and laws have been located within a physical theory, standard
              views of the relationship between laws and causation including what are known
              as the "singularist" view and the "covering-law" approach are evaluated and
              found wanting. Other concepts closely related to those of law and of causation,
              such as the notion of physical necessity, are explored as well. The project
              results in an accurate and precise account of the relationship between physical
              laws -- of each of the three types -- and causation as embodied in the Green's
              function.
