Abstract    :
              Proposal Abstract Greg Mitman Environment, Health and Place in Global
              Perspective: Conference Proposal   This project is a two-day workshop-style
              conference devoted to "Environment, Health, and Place in Global Perspective,"
              in April 2002 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The conference aims to
              bring together an interdisciplinary group of scholars drawing from the fields
              of environmental history, history of science, history of medicine, the social
              studies of science, and medical geography to explore the relationships between
              environment and health from a global perspective. One of the central
              theoretical questions of this conference is to explore how considerations of
              materiality, environment, and place can contribute to new historiographic
              perspectives within the history of science that move us beyond debates
              generated by social constructivism and its critics. A companion purpose of this
              conference is to discuss questions and frameworks that link the local to more
              global and comparative historical narratives.  Through the 1990's, many
              creative contributions to the history of science, as elsewhere in science
              studies, have revolved around the sociocultural dimensions of scientific work.
              These explorations, whether of scientists' language, practices, or social
              relations have been attacked for neglecting the material engagements and
              interventions of science, as well as scientists' own, often more naturalistic
              accounts of what they do. Over the last few years, within the history of
              science itself as well as within neighboring fields such as environmental and
              medical history, scholars have grown impatient with the ideological polarity of
              these debates. Largely granting the constructivists' points about the
              importance of society and culture to natural knowledge, these scholars have
              sought new ways of  reconciling these insights with a greater appreciation of
              the material dimensions of science. Within the history of science, this trend
              has led to a growing appreciation of the importance of geography and place in
              scientific work and in this and other fields, of the ways in which histories of
              place or environment both involve and invoke the human body. This conference
              will bring together individuals from each of these fields to discuss and chart
              frameworks for this new methodological terrain toward which they have been
              converging.  Organizers also hope to steer conferees toward international
              comparisons and questions.    Topically centered upon the history of
              environment, place and health, conference participants include scholars whose
              work ranges through two centuries and across America and Europe as well as the
              Third World.  The case studies reexamine older world-scale narratives, such as
              colonialism and modernization, often invoked in the history of science and its
              disciplinary neighbors.  Organizers also anticipate discussion about newer ones
              like globalization, which have sparked scholarly interests but whose
              implications for the history of science and these other fields have been less
              explored.
