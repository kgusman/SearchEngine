Abstract    :
                 The goal of this project is to determine the biological function of genes
              which encode six families of structurally related proteins, called the
              cellulose synthase like (CSL) proteins.  Based on the sequence similarity to
              cellulose synthase, it is hypothesized that the CSL  genes encode processive
              glycosyltransferases that may catalyze the synthesis of some of the
              non-cellulosic polymers that comprise plant cell walls and other
              exopolysaccharides such as stylar secretions and mucilage, or the glycosyl
              residues on arabinogalactan proteins  Because plant cell walls and
              exopolysaccharides are the dominant component of biomass on earth, knowledge of
              the enzymes and genes associated with the synthesis of these compounds may
              facilitate methods for the production and utilization of plant biomass.  The
              technical approach that will be used to determine the function of the CSL 
              genes exploits the recently completed full genome sequence of Arabidopsis to
              facilitate directed genetic analysis of the genes.  Most of the CSL  genes will
              be inactivated by insertional mutagenesis.  In addition, the expression of the
              CSL  genes will be altered by producing transgenic plants that have increased
              or decreased accumulation of mRNA for the CSL  genes.  The effects of the
              mutations and transgenic events on the growth and development of the plants,
              and on plant polysaccharide composition will be analyzed in order to associate
              each CSL  gene with a specific  biological role and enzyme of known catalytic
              activity.  A list of the accession numbers of the genes to be analyzed during
              this project can be found at

              the gene families can be found at
