Abstract    :
              This IGERT program is a multi-disciplinary doctoral traineeship in
              Socio-Technical Infrastructure for Electronic Transactions (STIET). The
              extraordinarily rapid changes in communications and computing technology, and
              in the uses and requirements people have for these technologies, have given
              rise to problems that are not well-suited to narrow, traditional solutions. 
              That these problems are important should be self-evident: electronic
              transactions are increasingly central to social, economic and political
              activity in nearly every realm of human endeavor, within and between nearly
              every location on the planet.  The infrastructure to support safe, meaningful,
              efficient, equitable and productive transactions will determine the extent to
              which the information revolution is socially beneficial. STIET will offer a
              comprehensive program from matriculation to graduation that will focus on the
              interaction between social and technical mechanisms in order to respond to
              these needs through current research and the training of a corps of scholars to
              carry forward teaching and research in this area. The program will: (i) provide
              fellowships for the first two years of graduate study; (ii) require 3 STIET
              core courses and 2 advanced STIET electives; (iii) provide a weekly research
              seminar and biannual day-long workshops; (iv) develop a multi-disciplinary,
              cross-school community of scholars within Michigan through collective and
              collaborative activities, both synchronous and asynchronous (with
              computer-supported community and collaboration technologies); and (v) build
              connections to the external multi-disciplinary research community through its
              Web site, conference travel, and research experiences at industrial partner
              facilities. When fully implemented, the program is expected to engage about 35
              doctoral students at various stages of their degree.  Through the resources and
              activities of STIET, the students will be encouraged and supported so that they
              receive serious preparation for multi-disciplinary research and pursue
              multi-disciplinary approaches to understanding and solving important
              socio-technical problems in their dissertation research.  A large group of
              faculty are involved from several disciplines (computer science, economics,
              information, business, public policy) with a long-standing commitment to
              multi-disciplinary and collaborative research. The team includes collaborative
              research partners from prominent industrial labs.  A professional Master's
              programs in this area is already in place, which provide a graduate student
              community, a student services infrastructure, and a fertile recruiting ground
              for promising doctoral students.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to
              meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
              multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal
              skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to
              catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new,
              innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment
              for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
              In the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-two
              institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and
              engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award
              reside in the Directorates for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences;
              Computer and Information Science and Engineering; and Education and Human
              Resources.
