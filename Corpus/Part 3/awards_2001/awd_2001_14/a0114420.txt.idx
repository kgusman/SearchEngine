Abstract    :
              This multidisciplinary IGERT program will train graduate students in areas at
              the interface of evolutionary biology, functional genomics, and computational
              biology in a way that will enable them to collaborate productively across
              traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The emerging fields of comparative and
              functional genomics will reshape biological research in the next twenty years
              and have a profound impact on medicine and human health, agriculture,
              engineering, and our understanding of the origin of life and the relationships
              among living organisms.  Research in these emerging disciplines requires the
              coordinated interaction of scientists with diverse backgrounds in evolution,
              molecular biology, and computer science, yet current departmental boundaries at
              most universities do not foster interactions among these areas.  The
              comprehensive IGERT training plan at the University of Arizona is intended to
              meet these challenges.  This program includes advising, research rotations and
              colloquia, two novel multidisciplinary courses that engage students in hands-on
              problem solving, additional lecture and laboratory courses, training in ethics,
              a monthly discussion group, opportunities to interact with visiting scientists,
              bi-annual mini-symposia, opportunities to mentor undergraduates in research,
              and offsite internships at other academic institutions or at leading genomics
              companies. Finally, the training plan includes a strategy to recruit both
              minority undergraduate and graduate students into science, drawing on the
              Hispanic and Native American populations in Arizona. Some of the proposed
              training initiatives build on existing structures; others are entirely new. 
              The University of Arizona is particularly well suited for this training program
              because of existing strengths in evolution, functional genomics, and
              computation, a strong graduate program, and an institutional commitment to
              interdisciplinary programs.  Moreover, the individual participants in this
              program have a long track record of success in training students and a
              commitment to multidisciplinary collaborations.  The impact of the proposed
              training program uniting three research areas will be to equip the next
              generation of biologists with the tools to tackle the challenges of
              genome-scale research.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the
              challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
              multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal
              skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to
              catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new,
              innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment
              for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
              In the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-two
              institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and
              engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award
              reside in the Directorates for Biological Sciences; Engineering; Computer and
              Information Science and Engineering; and Education and Human Resources.
