Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Ms. Deborah Keene will conduct
              doctoral dissertation research under the direction of Dr. Ervan Garrison.  The
              project centers on the Grove's Creek Site, a Native American Village dating to
              the Mississippian period (AD 1000-1580).  The Grove's Creek Site is on Skidaway
              Island, near Savannah, Georgia.  There are two objectives to this project.  The
              first is to combine geophysical data with a geographic information system (GIS)
              and create a subsurface map of the site.  The second is to determine whether
              the inhabitants of the Grove's Creek Site lived there year round or seasonally.
                Current archaeological methods are inherently destructive; therefore, any
              information that is lost can never be recovered.  The refinement of a mapping
              procedure using a limited amount of excavation will result in greater
              preservation of archaeological sites.  The first step of this mapping procedure
              is to collect shallow geophysical data.  During the Grove's Creek project both
              the conductivity and magnetism of the soil were measured.  Archaeologically
              significant remains such as cooking hearths and burned clay will cause the
              conductivity and magnetism of the surrounding soil to be higher.  When all of
              the data are plotted, contour maps are created in which these higher readings
              are visible.  The size and shape of the contours give clues as to what
              subsurface features created them.  We use this information to predict the types
              of archaeological remains and will then excavate to test several of these
              predictions.  Ultimately, this process can be used to map an archaeological
              site with very little digging.  Although there are many important
              Mississippian sites along the Georgia coast, they are still not fully
              understood.  There is currently considerable disagreement about whether
              Mississippian peoples were true agriculturists and could live in their village
              year round or still had to do some hunting and gathering and so traveled for
              part of the year.  Three methods shall be employed to determine whether the
              inhabitants of Grove's Creek lived there year round or seasonally.  The first
              is to look at the plant and animal remains at the site.  Different animals and
              plants are available at different times of the year.  For example, certain
              fruits are available only in the fall and certain fish migrate nearby in
              particular months.  By identifying the animals and plants at the site and the
              times that they were available for consumption, we can determine when the site
              was occupied.  The second is to study site architecture.  In many Mississippian
              communities, there is evidence for both summer and winter houses.  Two winter
              houses have already been found at the site, and if a summer house is found,
              that would show that the site was occupied year round.  The last way to
              determine occupation is by isotopic analysis of oyster shells.  By measuring
              the oxygen isotopes in the growth layers of the shell, it is possible to
              determine water temperature and therefore the time of year when the animal was
              killed.  Analysis of multiple shells will determine what seasons the site was
              occupied.  This project will not only develop a mapping procedure that will
              protect archaeological sites; it will also address questions, which are
              important to the understanding of coastal subsistence and settlement patterns
              of Native American cultures.
