Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports
              instrument development at the University of California Riverside. The ability
              to probe matter at low temperatures (300 mK), high magnetic fields (10 Tesla),
              under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (10-11 Torr), and with resolution below a
              tenth of a nanometer pushes back the limits of our ability to understand matter
              in details not hitherto possible.  The development of a scanning tunneling
              microscope with these capabilities allows controlled imaging, manipulation,
              spectroscopic characterization, and chemical modification of individual atoms
              and molecules.  In addition to the charge, the spin of the electrons can be
              probed at the nanoscale, enabling an understanding of nanomagnetism.  The
              development of this microscope encompasses a wide range of experimental
              techniques, thus providing valuable opportunities for education and training of
              undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates.  These
              techniques and the science made possible by the microscope will be integrated
              into a new course on nanoscience.  It is envisioned that the microscope will
              serve as a centerpiece for collaborative research involving the investigation
              of nanoscale phenomena and bring together researchers from different
              disciplines.  The instrument impact broad scientific research  which include
              single molecule spectroscopy, nanocatalysis, surface and interface magnetism,
              nanowires, and cryogenic fluid behavior on alkali metal film.  The
              advancement of nanotechnology depends critically on instrumentation which can
              be used to probe objects having nanometer dimensions.  In this regard, the
              invention of the scanning probe microscope in 1981 by Binnig and Rohrer has
              played a central role in the rapid advances which have been made in the
              understanding of materials at the atomic and molecular scales. The desire to
              probe in ever greater details and to access hitherto unobservable properties of
              the system requires the development of new instrumentation.  This award from
              the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the development of
              a new more powerful microscope at the University of California. The new
              microscope will make it possible to probe nanometer objects whose behavior can
              only be revealed at minus 273 degrees Celsius and at magnetic fields two
              hundred thousand times greater than the earth field. The development of such an
              instrumentation provides unique opportunities for the education and training of
              undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates in this
              critical field of science and technology.  In addition, activities surrounding
              this development will be integrated into the teaching curriculum in the form of
              a new course on nanoscience. The unique capabilities of the proposed
              instrumentation will allow researchers from different disciplines to work
              together on nanoscale problems.  Nanotechnology naturally pulls together a wide
              range of scientists and engineers since everything around us are made from and
              involve the transformation of atoms and molecules.
