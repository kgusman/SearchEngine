Abstract    :
              9733938  Ben Shen  This CAREER project integrates research and education on a
              central theme to bridge chemistry and biology in the current undergraduate and
              graduate programs. The research aspect of the project aims at investigating
              nonactin biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus DSM 40695 to provide mechanistic
              insight on how type I polyketide synthase (PKS) controls the stereospecificity
              during polyketide biosynthesis. It is based on the hypothesis that nonactin is
              derived from tetramerization in a stereospecific (+)(-)(+)(-) fashion of (+)-
              and (-)-nonactic acid whose biosynthesis from acetate, propionate, and
              succinate is catalyzed by the nonactin synthase, a type I PKS catalyzing the
              complementary assembly of two enantiomeric polyketides. The specific goals of
              the project are first to characterize at the genetic and biochemical level how
              the nonactin synthase controls the stereospecificity during polyketide assembly
              and then to explore ways to make novel polyketide metabolites with predicted
              stereochemical centers by genetic manipulation of the nonactin synthase as well
              as other type I PKS genes. The outcome of these studies will reveal new insight
              about polyketide biosynthesis and shed light for rational engineering of PKS
              enzyme complexes to generate chemical structural diversity, leading to the
              discovery of new drugs. The educational aspect of the project aims at providing
              the undergraduate and graduate students a multi-disciplinary training in
              chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology. This will be accomplished by
              providing on the webpage modules consisting of biological examples of the
              chemistry covered in the current organic chemistry lecture and by developing
              plans for the establishment of "Biological Chemistry" as the fifth field of
              interests for the departmental graduate program. These efforts shall better
              prepare students who desire to pursue a career working at the interface of
              chemistry and biology. It is in programs that effectively combine chemistry and
              biology that new che mists with a broad range of skills and sound understanding
              of biology for solving important bioorganic chemistry problems will be
              produced.
