Abstract    :
              Abstract    9623221     Musfeldt    This five-year proposal is concerned with
              gaining further information on magnetically driven  phase transitions in
              low-dimensional organic and inorganic solids and expanding materials  chemistry
              coursework at the State University of New York. In general, the low-temperature
               spectroscopic response of several prototypical compounds in an external
              magnetic field will  be investigated. These compounds are well-known to display
              spin-density wave and  spin-Peierls type phase transitions, and many other
              interesting physical properties. In each  case, the Principal investigator and
              graduate students will: 1. completely characterize the  optical constants of
              these systems using low-temperature polarized infrared and optical 
              spectroscopies in the vicinity of the phase transition, 2. evaluate optical
              constants and  fundamental materials parameters, such as correlation parameters
              and electron-molecular  vibrational coupling constants, and 3. initiate
              magnetic field studies to probe interactions  between the spin-density wave
              condensate (spin-density-wave type) or the lattice dynamics 
              (spin-Peierls-type) and the spin system. At the completion of each set of
              experiments, the  analysis will focus on spectral properties which shed light
              on the phase transition mechanisms  and the changing nature of charge transport
              through the transition. Energy dissipation  mechanisms will receive particular
              attention. Chemical structure/property considerations, a  perspective which
              comes naturally to chemists, will also play a central role in the analysis.  
              %%%  The subject of magnetically driven phase transitions in organic molecular
              solids has received  a great deal of attention in recent years. Despite
              extensive study, the conditions which govern  metal - insulator transitions in
              low-dimensional solids are a subject of increasing controversy.  Therefore, the
              time has come to re-examine this traditional set of materials with a new set of
               goals, priorities and tools. The overall goal  of this research is to
              establish a broad program  devoted to investigations of magnetically driven
              phase transitions in low-dimensional solids.  Four specific projects are
              proposed that are of immediate interest to the organic and  inorganic materials
              chemistry community.  These projects will allow the Principal  investigator and
              others to evaluate the most promising paths for further investigations in the 
              area of magnetic materials.
