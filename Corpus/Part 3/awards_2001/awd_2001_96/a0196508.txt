Abstract    :
              New materials have been introduced to the construction industry for the repair
              and strengthening of the deteriorating infrastructure system.  One area of
              particular interest has been the use of Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) to
              repair and strengthen concrete and masonry structures.  Unfortunately, there is
              very little long-term field experience or basic research to indicate that FRP
              materials used in combination with concrete and masonry will withstand the
              elements as expected.  The effectiveness of the FRP system relies completely on
              the bond between the substrate and fabric.  Concrete and masonry are porous
              systems that typically exchange free moisture with the environment.   This
              natural free moisture movement can be interrupted by the application of an FRP
              system.  Another concern is the application of repair systems to the surface of
              corrosion damaged concrete with no thought as to the effect on the corrosion
              process that exist in the element.  There is a need for training in basic
              corrosion science and durability of civil engineering structures that is not
              addressed in undergraduate or graduate programs.  A new course will be created
              at the University of Wyoming from Career support to provide training to
              students in durability of structures.  With funding from the Career award and
              using the data gathered from research, develop an FRP repair/strengthening
              seminar series.  The short course has the added benefit of providing technology
              transfer of the findings to the engineering community for comment and use.
