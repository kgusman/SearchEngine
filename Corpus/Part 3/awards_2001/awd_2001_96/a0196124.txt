              ABSTRACT

The problems that are to be addressed in this project involve, 
on
              one hand,  dynamics of  flows on homogeneous spaces of Lie 
groups, and, on
              the other hand, the multi-dimensional theory 
of Diophantine approximations.
              Various connections between 
these two fields have been found in the last two
              decades, 
which significantly stimulated progress in both fields. During
              
recent years, the proposer's research has been centered on 
developing new
              links between homogeneous dynamics and number 
theory, which has resulted in
              solving many important problems, 
as well as in creating new directions for
              further research. 
The investigator is to continue his work on bounded
              trajectories,
growth rate of orbits, Diophantine approximation with weights
              
and Khintchine-type theorems on manifolds. 

This project deals with
              algebraic dynamical systems and their 
applications to number theory. Many
              problems concerning 
simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational
              numbers 
can be cast in terms of the behavior of certain orbits. 
Dynamical
              systems in the present context deal with how points 
in a system move over
              time, given a set of differential equations 
(or laws of nature) governing the
              system. It turns out that various 
numerical approximations used in the theory
              of integer equations 
can be better calculated once they are phrased in
              dynamical systems 
language.
