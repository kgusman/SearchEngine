The
              objective of the project is to investigate analytic and
geometric aspects of
              Hamilton's Ricci flow of Riemannian metrics,
and related topics. This flow has
              been successful in
topologically classifying Riemannian manifolds
              satisfying
positive curvature conditions. Hamilton's program for the
              Ricci
flow on 3-dimensional manifolds is an approach to
              understanding
Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, which subsumes the
              Poincare
Conjecture.  The main topics considered in the project include
the
              search for new Harnack inequalities for the Ricci flow,
furthering the
              geometric understanding of the existing Harnack
inequalities, and
              investigations in the behavior of the Ricci
flow for collapsing solutions.
              Harnack inequalities are
fundamental to the area of partial differential
              equations and
they have been pioneered for parabolic equations in
              differential
geometry by the work of Li, Yau, and Hamilton.  Hamilton's
              matrix
Harnack inequality is especially important in the analysis
              of
singularities that arise under the Ricci flow.  Understanding
these
              singularities has had a major impact on the study of other
evolution equations
              such as the mean curvature flow, and depends
upon tools such as a compactness
              theorem related to injectivity
radius estimates.  We shall consider aspects of
              the Ricci flow in
the absence of such estimates, where solutions
              collapse.

Many phenomena are modeled by evolutionary equations, such as
              the
transfer of heat and the evolution of interfaces between molten
and solid
              forms of metal. The study of evolution equations in
geometry has grown
              tremendously in the last several years.  In
many cases geometric evolution
              equations deform an initial
geometric structure to an improved one, but in
              other cases the
structures develop singularities. It is of fundamental
              importance
to analyze these singularities. Such a study has been carried
              out
to a large extent for the Ricci flow, which is an evolution
equation
              deforming geometric structures on manifolds, the locally
Euclidean spaces
              arising in Einstein's Theory of Relativity and
most major branches of
              mathematics and theoretical physics.  For
example, space-time is a
              4-dimensional manifold and the universe
we live in is a 3-dimensional
              manifold. It is widely believed by
mathematicians that any 3-dimensional
              manifold may be decomposed
into pieces which admit canonical geometric
              structures.  Since
the Ricci flow deforms geometric structures, and all
              manifolds
admit geometric structures, it may be used as an approach to
              the
above question if it can be shown that the flow deforms
              geometric
structures to canonical geometric structures.
