Abstract    :
              Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods for
              numerically solving hyperbolic conservation laws, Hamilton-Jacobi equations
              and closely related convection-diffusion equations. Such schemes are not tied
              to the specific eigen-structure of the problem, and hence can be implemented
              in a straightforward manner as black-box solvers for a wide variety of
              nonlinear equations governing the spontaneous evolution of large gradient
              phenomena. The first-order  Lax-Friedrichs scheme is the forerunner for
              suchcentral schemes. The  second-order Nessyahu-Tadmor scheme offers high
              resolution while  retaining the simplicity of Riemann-solver-free approach. In
              the  convective regime the improved resolution of the Nessyahu-Tadmor  scheme
              and its generalizations is achieved by using high-order  piecewise polynomial
              reconstructions and high-order quadrature  formulas for computing the flux
              integrals. At the same time, this  family of staggered central schemes suffers
              from excessive numerical viscosity when a sufficiently small time step is
              enforced, e.g., due to the presence of (degenerate) diffusive term. Recently
              Kurganov and Tadmor introduced a new family of central schemes, which retain
              the simplicity of staggered central schemes, yet they enjoy a smaller
              numerical viscosity. In particular, these schemes admit a simple semi-discrete
              formulation. This project aims  to develop new, minimally dissipative fully-
              and semi-discrete central  schemes for conservation laws. The main ideas
              behind the construction  of these new schemes is the use of more precise
              information of the local propagation speed, and realizing the (non-smooth part
              of the) approximate solution in terms of its cell averages integrated over the
              nonsymmetric  Riemann fans of varying size.  Hyperbolic conservation laws,
              Hamilton-Jacobi equations and convection- diffusion equations are of great
              practical importance. They govern a variety of physical phenomena that appear
              in fluid mechanics, gas dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, astrophysics,
              groundwater flow, meteorology, semiconductors, reactive flows, two-phase flow
              in oil reservoirs, non-Newtonian flows, front propagation and several
              other areas. Financial modeling, traffic flow, differential games,
              optimal control and image enhancement are among the most recent
              applications of the above models.Genuinely multidimensional high-resolution
               semi-discrete central schemes provide a rather simple and universal  method
              for solving these problems. At the same time, the computational efficiency of
              central schemes is extremely high. For example, recent  numerical experiments
              in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics  demonstrate that using central
              schemes allows to achieve the desired  resolution about 25 times faster in
              comparison with other methods. In  general, the advantage of the new
              semi-discrete central schemes over  alternative upwind methods is particularly
              amplified when they are used  to solve complicated multidimensional systems
              arising in practice. The proposed schemes will be also applied to such
              important problems as compressible and incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes
              equations, multi-phase model of geometric optics, multicomponent flow
              and compressible bubbles models, moving boundaries problems, shock reflection
              problem for the unsteady transonic small disturbance equation and others.
