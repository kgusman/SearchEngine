Significant progress has been made in the study of the
Reeb-dynamics
              of a three dimensional contact manifold and its
topological implications. 
              Past research focused on periodic
orbits of the Reeb vectorfield, while this
              project deals with a
different class of trajectories, the so-called
              characteristic
chords. These are orbits of the Reeb vectorfield that hit a
              given
Legendrian knot twice at two different times (or more general, a
given
              Legendrian submanifold). In the case of periodic orbits the
main tools were
              pseudoholomorphic curves in the symplectisation
of the contact manifold with
              domain being a punctured Riemann
surface without boundary, while in the case
              of characteristic
chords the domain will have boundary and also punctures on
              the
boundary. A free boundary condition will be imposed. One aim of
this
              project is to investigate when characteristic chords exist,
a question which
              is related to a conjecture of V.I. Arnold in
contact geometry. The method
              developed by the principal
investigator is a new version of a classical result
              by E. Bishop
about local fillings of a real surface near an isolated
              elliptic
complex tangency.  The other aspect of the research project is
joint
              work with Helmut Hofer which is providing the analytic
setting for a new
              invariant of Legendrian knots ("Contact
Homology") in a three dimensional
              contact manifold, where
pseudoholomorphic curves on punctured Riemann surfaces
              play the
key role. This would also provide a more systematic approach to
the
              existence question for characteristic chords, since existence
results would
              imply nontriviality for the invariants in certain
cases. Approaching the
              existence question of characterictic
chords by filling methods is only
              possible if the contact
manifold is three dimensional while the construction
              of Contact
Homology should also work in higher dimensions where very
              little
is known about the dynamics of the Reeb vectorfield.  On the
other
              hand, every closed three dimensional manifold admits a
contact form, with
              between dynamics and topology closely related.

This research project deals
              with the theory of Legendrian knots
and dynamical systems induced by a Reeb
              vectorfield.  In recent
years close relationships have been found between knot
              theory and
quantum field theory, a part of modern theoretical
              physics.
Dynamical systems of Reeb type describe a very diverse spectrum
of
              phenomena in physics, such as the motion of a satellite in the
presence of
              gravitational forces, or the motion of the particles
of an ideal
              incompressible fluid if the motion is in an
equilibrium (steady) state and the
              pressure is almost constant.
