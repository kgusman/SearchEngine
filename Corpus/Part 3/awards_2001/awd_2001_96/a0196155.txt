Global dynamics in near-integrable Hamiltonian systems with
several
              degrees of freedom will be studied. The research aims to
progress towards
              proving the conjecture about the existence of a
generic topological
              instability in such systems, known as
"Arnold's diffusion", effected via
              resonances. The first goal is
to obtain an adequate local description of
              various geometric
objects that the perturbation causes to appear. These
              objects can
be characterized by their rotation vectors.  First, they
              are
lower-dimensional partially hyperbolic (whiskered) tori and
              the
Lagrangian manifolds (whiskers) asymptotic to these tori.
Generally, the
              collection of all the rotation vectors yielding
whiskered tori form a set of
              the first category. Rotation numbers
in the "gaps" in it describe so-called
              "Aubry-Mather sets". Yet
the latter term is somewhat obscure beyond the case
              of two
degrees of freedom.  Incorporating many of the above mentioned
objects
              of all types into a single global geometric framework
effected as an atlas
              over the phase space, is the second, and the
main goal. Apropos of
              "Aubry-Mather sets", this will require
mutual interpretation of the results
              obtained via variational
methods of Lagrangian mechanics and geometric
              implicit function
theorems, such as KAM, of Hamiltonian approach.

The
              proposed research focuses on instability as a generic feature
of complex
              mechanical systems, be it the Solar system, or a
polyatomic molecule. In order
              to describe such, one needs to know
the present state of the system, and the
              equations of its future
evolution. Typically, due to their complexity, one
              cannot obtain
the solutions of these equations with the initial
              conditions
incorporated. Otherwise, and this is an exceptional case,
              the
system is called integrable. Such would be the Solar system if
one
              considers only the interaction of each individual planet with
the Sun,
              disregarding in particular the mutual gravitational
attraction between the
              planets, etc. Yet the laws of motion are
known exactly, the initial state of a
              system has to be measured,
which leads to errors, however small. The
              hypothesis of
instability, alias "Arnold's diffusion," suggests that
              two
infinitesimally different initial conditions may result in
              two
qualitatively different scenarios ad infinitum. In particular,
this is
              believed to be true for small perturbations of integrable
systems, e.g. if one
              takes into account the influence of the Moon
or Jupiter on the orbital motion
              of the Earth. The suitable
mathematical enviroment to model the systems in
              question is
provided by geometrical mechanics. The technological
              motivation
for this research comes from molecular chemistry and biology
where
              billions of years it would take the instability to develop
itself on a cosmic
              scale, translate into fractions of a second.
