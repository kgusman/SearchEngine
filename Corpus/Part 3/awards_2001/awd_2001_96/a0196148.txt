Abstract    :
              This project studies a general and powerful method for  program optimization. 
              This method is based on  incrementalization, which allows repeated computations
              on  slightly changing inputs to be performed efficiently by  updating their
              values incrementally from one computation to  the next.  Since all non-trivial
              computations proceed in an  iterative fashion, which requires repeated updates
              of  program states, incrementalization underlies essentially all  loop
              optimizations.  This project focuses on an important  application of
              incrementalization, namely, loop optimization  for aggregate computations on
              arrays.  This optimization  can produce drastic speedups of programs for
              problems in  image processing, computational geometry, computer graphics, 
              multimedia, matrix computation, etc.  The method captures  aggregate array
              computations in loop bodies and  incrementally updates their results over
              iterations.  Part  of the analysis is reduced to symbolic simplification of 
              constraints on loop variables and array subscripts.  Analytical and
              experimental results both show drastic  speedups compared to previous
              techniques.  Work specifically  planned for this project includes: refining and
              extending  the techniques and algorithms, implementing the algorithms, 
              analyzing the performance of the optimization algorithm and  the optimized
              programs, and developing models for the time  and space complexity and data
              locality of the programs that  will enable us to tune the optimizations.
