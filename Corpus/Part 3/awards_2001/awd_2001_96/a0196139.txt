Abstract    :
                9605050  Zhang      This award supports extension of work funded under DMS 
              9626193 to include cooperation with researchers at China's  National Laboratory
              of Scientific and Engineering Computing,  Institute of Computational
              Mathematics.  Zhimin Zhang, Texas  Tech University, intends to pursue
              collaboration with Shi  Zhongci, Director of the National Laboratory for
              Scientific  and Engineering Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences,  Beijing. 
              The U.S. PI plans to involve one U.S.  undergraduate and one U.S. graduate
              student in the project.  The students will join the P.I. in research visits to
              China  to develop their own research in computational mathematics.    The
              primary objective of this project is the study of  derivative superconvergence
              and its recovery in finite  element computations.  Such study is of fundamental
               importance in computational mechanics in that engineers are  interested in
              more effective ways to estimate stress, strain  energy, etc.  At present, most
              commercial codes used in  engineering are required to have adaptive
              capabilities which  allow computations to be performed in the most efficient 
              way.  Knowledge of superconvergence is necessary for this  adaptivity design. 
              The results of this research will have  significant impact on large-scale
              scientific computing  problems arising in structural mechanics.    Support on
              the Chinese side will be provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation.
