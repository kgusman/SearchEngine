Abstract    :
                    Physical and biological processes are historically considered to be  the
              most  important  factors affecting the carbon cycle in the  ocean.  Specific
              processes  include  air-sea CO2 exchange, surface mixing,  venting  of  deep
              waters,  carbon  fixation,  respiration,  calcium  carbonate  formation  and
              sedimentation. Recent   studies   now   suggest  that   light-initiated
              (photochemical)  processes also strongly impact  carbon cycling  at  the  sea
              surface,  particularly  with  respect to the  photodegradation  of  dissolved
              organic  carbon  (DOC)  and  the  production of  bacterial  substrates.  The
              evidence for the importance of  photochemical oxidation of aged, biologically
              refractory DOC includes: 1)  irradiation of sterile-filtered seawater results
              in  high production rates  of COz, CO and biologically utilizable substrates,
              2)  low  productivity  central gyres appear to be net  heterotrophic  (i.e.,
              bacterial  C  utilization rates often exceed primary productivity rates),  3)
              bacterial  C  utilization rates are estimated to be about the  same  as  the 
              production  rate of biologically labile substrates from DOM  photodegradation
              in  open oceanic surface waters, and 4) a significant  fraction of the carbon
              assimilated  by open ocean bacteria in surfaces  waters is isotonically  old.
              Despite  this  strong evidence the  quantitative importance of photochemistry
              in the oceanic carbon cycle is  still unknown.           Studies will focus on:
              (1) the photochemical production of CO2 and    CO from  marine DOM, (2) the
              photochemical loss of DOC, and (3) the    microbial uptake  and 
              remineralization of photooxidized DOM.  Results    will  assess the  impact  of
               photochemistry on carbon fluxes and    organic  carbon  mass balances   in  
              the            water  column,    including  primary    and   bacterial   
              productivities,   microbial  respiration  and,  at   the   BATS  station,   
              particulate   carbon   fluxes.   We  expect   Bacterial   utilization    of
              photooxidized,  aged  DOM  may  largely explain  the  apparent    discrepancy
              between  high  bacterial C utilization rates and low primary    productivity
              rates  that  have  been  frequently observed for low    productivity  waters.
              Another  important goal of this study is to    develop algorithms,  based  on
              action   spectra,  DOM  absorbance  and    surface  irradiance,  to  predict
              photochemical  rates  in surface    waters. These algorithms  in  combination
              with  remotely sensed DOM    fluorescence to Predict CO2 and CO photochemical
              production  and DOC    photodegradation rates over large areas of the  ocean.
              Previous    successes in studying photochemical processes in  a  variety  of
              marine    environments  gives  a  strong  foundation  for      assessing    the
                 importance of these processes in the oceanic carbon cycle.
