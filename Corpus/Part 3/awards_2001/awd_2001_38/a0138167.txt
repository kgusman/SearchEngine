ABSTRACT

     Three
              problems will be investigated, related by the
common thread of oscillatory
              integrals with degenerate 
(or singular) phase functions. First, estimates for
              Fourier
integral operators associated with two-sided Morin 
singularities,
              both symmetric and asymmetric, will be
considered. This will be attempted by
              using new 
decompositions of the operators that reflect the
              underlying
geometry of the phase functions. Secondly, global uniqueness
will
              be considered in the Calderon problem for low-regularity
conductivities and
              potentials in dimensions greater
than two, using Radon transform
              decompositions of the 
potentials. Finally, a detailed microlocal analysis
              will 
be made of the problem for low-regularity and/or conormal
              
conductivities in two dimensions.

     The operators to be studied in this
              project transform
functions on one space to functions on another space
              
(possibly the same, possibly different) in a way in which
oscillation
              (cancellation caused by high-frequency waves)
plays an important role. This
              general type of operator has
been central to progress in the last thirty years
              in the
understanding of a wide range of partial differential
equations
              governing, e.g., wave propagation of sound and
electromagnetic waves. It turns
              out that the mathematical
analysis of CAT scanners and other noninvasive
              medical 
imaging technologies falls under the same framework.
The current
              project should give a better understanding of the
mathematical foundations of
              these techniques. In the longer
term, this might contribute to refinement and
              improvement
of these imaging methods.
