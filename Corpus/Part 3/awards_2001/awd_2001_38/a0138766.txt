Abstract    :
              The "Tufts' Pre-college Engineering for Teachers (PCET)" project will provide
              professional development experiences for K-12 teachers in the state of
              Massachusetts to help them address the Science and Technology/Engineering
              Curriculum Framework adopted by the state in 2001. This framework clearly
              states that schools should provide a comprehensive science and
              technology/engineering program enrolling all students preK-12.  The project
              will build upon work that has already been done to infuse engineering literacy
              into K-12 schools.  PCET is a collaboration between Tufts University, Worcester
              Polytechnic Institute, University of Massachusetts-Lowell, and University of
              Massachusetts-Amherst.  Each of these engineering schools will act as a local
              resource for the teachers participating from that section of the state, with
              Tufts University serving as the lead institution.  The project model involves
              developing a cadre of 96 mentor teachers through a series of annual Summer
              Institutes, and assisting these teachers in the development of curriculum
              materials and adoption strategies for their local contexts.  These mentor
              teachers will also, with the help of project staff, design and deliver similar
              training sessions to an additional 384 "satellite teachers" in their home
              institutions.  Science and technology teachers have been identified as the
              target audience for these professional development experiences.  Project work
              will begin with teachers in grades 9-12, and work backward through middle and
              elementary grade bands (6-8, 3-5, K-2) over the life of the project.
