Abstract    :
                   This four year continuation of a program to monitor ELF/VLF radio noise
              (frequencies in the range 5 Hz to 32 kHz) at Arrival Heights, Antarctica, will
              extend the observational record to more than twenty years, and will allow more
              precise estimates of noise statistics.  The radiometer was first installed at
              its present location during the austral summer of 1984-5 and has been operated
              continuously since  that time, thus providing a record of ELF/VLF noise in the
              Antarctic that is unprecedented in its continuity and duration. In parallel
              with this system, an identical one has been operating on the Stanford
              University campus for almost the same period of time, thus providing a
              (northern) mid-latitude comparison data set.
     Since the predominant
              sources of ELF/VLF radio noise are thunderstorms occurring in the tropical
              regions, the Arrival Heights and Stanford systems provide complementary views
              of the thunderstorm activity occurring in the tropics.  The long-term
              statistics can then provide independent information about global change.  The
              low background in the Arrival Heights record further allows the determination
              of Schumann resonances.  These are quasi-standing electro-magnetic waves that
              exist in the Earth's 'electromagnetic' cavity (the space between the surface of
              the Earth and the Ionosphere).  Temporal changes in these resonant frequencies
              can be related to variations in the characteristics of the ionosphere.
