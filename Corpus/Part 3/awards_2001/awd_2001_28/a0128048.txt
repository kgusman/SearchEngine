Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a novel
              optoelectronic sensing system for the high-speed identification and sorting of
              metals including aluminum alloys. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to
              unambiguously identify metal alloys by alloy type, including low atomic number
              elements, in less than 50-milliseconds per sample. The Scrap Recycling Industry
              reports that more than 30 billion pounds of nonferrous scrap metals are
              produced each year in the U.S. alone. About 70% of this scrap is aluminum or
              aluminum alloys. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) reports that
              more than 10 billion pounds of these nonferrous metals are discarded each year
              in landfills, because recycling is neither technically nor economically
              practical. Existing methods of sortation use visual examination and hand
              sortation. Smelting facilities for mixed metals are polluting and expensive to
              build and operate. Using advanced spectrographic radiation and detection
              techniques, including computer analysis, the proposed technology will improve
              alloy identification accuracy and sort metal alloys automatically by type of
              alloy at speeds never before attainable.

The commercial impact of this
              project will be increased scrap utilization, increased scrap value and reduced
              environmental pollution is enormous. The potential worldwide market exceeds $2
              Billion annually.
