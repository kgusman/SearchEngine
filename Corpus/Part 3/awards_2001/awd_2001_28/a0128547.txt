Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new surface modification technique for manufacturing copper indium diselenide
              (CIS) thin films, an important emerging photovoltaic technology. It will
              eliminate present toxic processing steps involving cadmium sulfide deposition,
              cyanide etch, all of which have many unfavorable repercussions to the
              manufacturer and the environment. The key step will be to devise a simple,
              inexpensive process, using air and a non-toxic aqueous solution, to alter the
              surface properties of CIS films. This step will eliminate the need for the
              cadmium component, the cyanide etch and the disposal of hazardous chemicals. It
              will also improve the efficiency of solar cells made with inexpensive coating
              methods. Performance evaluation of the modified CIS solar cells will validate
              the new concept. This innovation is anticipated to simplify manufacturing,
              lower costs and improve the efficiency of photovoltaic modules.

Applications
              for the CIS photovoltaic technology range from powering small appliances to
              electric utility. Non-utility applications include solar cars, building
              integration, mobile systems and space systems. Lower costs, fewer components
              and easier manufacturing could translate into a wider spectrum of commercial
              markets for CIS solar cells. Eliminating the toxicity issues will enhance the
              public perception of CIS photovoltaic technology. Its implementation will
              promote the market success of CIS solar cells to provide a timely solution to
              the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems.
