Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
              development of novel solid state facilitated transport membranes for the
              separation of carbon dioxide/hydrogen and carbon dioxide/methane mixtures. 
              Current best technologies are amine absorption or pressure-swing-adsorption
              both expensive, energy intensive processes. The key objective of this project
              is to deliver a new type of facilitated transport membrane in the form of a
              solid polymer electrolyte. To provide high gas fluxes, the membranes will be
              formed as thin-film composites. Preliminary studies indicate that solid polymer
              electrolyte composite membranes can show significantly improved performance
              over conventional facilitated transport and polymeric membranes.

Separation
              of carbon dioxide from natural gas and from hydrogen-containing refinery
              off-gases in refineries present a significant opportunity for
              membrane-based-gas separation. About 17% of U.S. natural gas requires
              processing to remove carbon dioxide. In refineries, hydrogen is typically
              produced by steam reforming of natural gas or light hydrocarbons and must be
              separated from carbon dioxide, which is produced as a by-product. Membrane
              separation offers many advantages over amine absorption or pressure-swing
              adsorption in these two applications. However more selective and robust
              membranes are needed to achieve these economics over conventional separation
              technology and this is reason for developing solid polymer electrolyte
              composite membranes.
