Abstract    :
              0128782 Harwood  This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs, allows
              a US investigator to join a geological field team sponsored by Antarctica New
              Zealand (the New Zealand national Antarctic program) and the Institute of
              Geophysical and Nuclear Sciences of New Zealand to gather seismic data over
              regions that have potentially important sedimentary records of
              paleoenvironmental conditions and tectonic uplift of the adjacent mountains.
              The paucity of exposures of Cenozoic strata in Antarctica, due to the present
              ice cover, requires the collection of geological data from drill cores. Seismic
              data are necessary for proper site selection toward future drilling and provide
              a means of understanding the depositional context of the drill sites. Much has
              been learned over the last 20 years of drilling by the DSDP, ODP and via the
              fast-ice and on-land drilling of the DVDP, MSSTS, CIROS and Cape Roberts
              Project drill holes. A new international drilling initiative, ANDRILL, is in an
              early stage of development, with an initial focus in the McMurdo Sound area
              using the proven Cape Roberts Project drilling technology. This award provides
              support for site survey work in three ANDRIL target areas that will result in
              new seismic information to address tectonic, basin history, and
              paleoenvironmental questions. The Principal Investigators have been invited to
              collaborate with a New Zealand seismic team during the 2001-2002 austral field
              season, and join an international collaborative effort with the United Kingdom
              and New Zealand to collect and interpret seismic data from the sea-ice and ice
              shelf in the McMurdo Sound region. US participation would allow the seismic
              program to include areas with considerable US interest. Financial support to
              enable the acquisition of seismic data in three target areas is the
              responsibility of the United States for New Harbour (NH), of New Zealand for
              Windless Bight (WB), and of the United Kingdom for Southern McMurdo Ice Shelf
              (SMIS). This project began initially as a 2-year NZ and UK collaborative
              project for WB and SMIS. At the ANDRILL Workshop (4/2001 at Oxford University)
              it became apparent that drill holes proposed in the New Harbour area could be
              the initial targets of ANDRILL because the extant drilling system would require
              little modification and because scientific targets require relatively modest
              investments in new site survey data. An invitation for the US to join this
              collaborative effort was extended to enable the collection of data in New
              Harbour during the first year of this project. In addition to the requisite
              site survey work, the seismic data will help address current questions
              regarding: (1) the geometry of sedimentary sequences that will provide insight
              on competing theories regarding development of the Victoria Land Basin, as well
              as cause and uplift history of the adjacent Transantarctic Mountains; (2) the
              contrasting stratigraphic history recorded in the Ferrar and Taylor valleys;
              (3) the postulated stability of the Dry Valley landscape under a cold, polar
              climate for the last 20 million years. The new seismic information will also
              enable the extension of existing drill core data into a broader stratigraphic
              framework. The spirit of international collaboration developed through the Cape
              Roberts Project and continuing with ANDRILL will result in scientific exchange
              during the follow-up studies of all three target areas. The existence of 12
              drill holes in the McMurdo Sound/Dry Valleys region, combined with new seismic
              data to be acquired by this project and from marine vessels, and future drill
              holes, will make this region a focus of future chronostratigraphic correlation
              on the Antarctic continental shelf.
