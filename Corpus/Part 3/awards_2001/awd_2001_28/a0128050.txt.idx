Abstract    :
              0128050 Lucca This award supports Don Lucca and students from the Oklahoma
              State University in an extensive collaboration with the universities of Aachen
              and Bremen in Germany.  The project will focus on discovering what factors are
              generating the new wave of high-tech The resulting U.S.-Germany Transregional
              Collaborative Research Center involves sixteen technical projects centered on
              the development of processes for the manufacture of complex, high-quality
              optical components for next generation applications in information technology
              and telecommunications, health care, the life sciences, sensing, lighting, and
              energy conversion.  There are technical projects in the areas of deign, had
              coatings, replication techniques, and measurement science and technology. 
              Funding for this long-term research center, with the exception of the project
              here described, is being supplied mainly by the Deutsche
              Forschungsgemeinschaft, the German counterpart to NSF.  The research focus of
              the U.S. project, "High Resolution Surface Zone Analysis," is the investigation
              of the near-surface mechanical nature of sol-gel derived diamond-turnable, hard
              mold coatings which will be used in the volume production of ultraprecision
              optics of polymers and glasses.  Nanoindentation will e used to study the
              near-surface mechanical properties including elastic modulus and hardness, and
              the surface residual stress state of the hard coatings.  Depth profiling
              studies will e performed on cross-sectioned and taper-sectioned coatings with a
              newly developed method for near surface zone analysis.  The adhesion and
              delamination behavior of the mold coatings will be explored with the use of
              nanoscratching.  The project will also further contribute to the development of
              advanced surface characterization tools needed for assessing the near-surface
              mechanical state at the nanometer scale.
