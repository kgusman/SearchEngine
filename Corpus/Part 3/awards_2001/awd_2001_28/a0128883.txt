This three-year award supports US-France collaboration in
              astronomy between Donald C. Ellison of North Carolina State University and Anne
              Decourchelle of the Astrophysics Department of the Center for Nuclear Studies
              in Saclay, France.  They propose to study the self-consistent theory of
              nonlinear particle acceleration and photon emission in supernova remants.  The
              objective is to provide an accurate and efficient means of interpreting X-ray
              and GeV gamma ray emissions in supernova remnants and TeV gamma rays. The
              research utilizes data collected during various space missions, including the
              US Chandra and European mission XMM-Newton, and data obtained from current and
              future spacecraft missions and ground-based telescopes.  

The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration on expertise in shock acceleration
              and cosmic ray origins.  This is complemented by French expertise in X-rays
              from shock heated plasma emissions in supernova remnants and experience with
              data gathered through spacecraft missions.  The collaboration will lead to a
              new state-of the art code that will advance understanding of the shock
              acceleration of cosmic rays and impact other astrophysics topics, such as, the
              origin of cosmic rays and the evolution of supernova remnants and their
              influence on interstellar medium.

This award represents the US side of
              parallel proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigator. The CNRS will support visits by French researcher to the United
              States.
