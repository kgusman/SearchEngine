Abstract    :
              During extreme events such as earthquakes and explosions, it is quite possible
              that a critical element of a building structure, such as a column, collapses.
              When a column in a building collapses the columns above this column, not being
              supported anymore, can collapse resulting in a catastrophic and "progressive
              collapse" of all floors above. Such a progressive collapse can result in tragic
              loss of many lives such as the 1995 Murrah Building tragedy in Oklahoma City. 
              In order to avoid such tragedies, the structure should have mechanisms that
              loss of one column does not result in a "domino" effect and progressive
              collapse of columns above or a large portion of the structure.  Dr. Astaneh has
              just completed successful testing of a steel cable-based mechanism to prevent
              such progressive collapses. In the system, steel cables are placed inside the
              floor slabs and when a column is removed, the cables act in a "catenary" action
              similar to a suspension bridge cable and prevent collapse of the floor and
              progressive collapse of the structure. The tests just completed have been for
              new construction where it is possible to place the steel cables inside the
              floor slabs. Realizing the success of this system in preventing collapse of new
              buildings, we are proposing to test the system as a measure of retrofit for
              existing vulnerable buildings. Fortunately, we have the specimen from the just
              completed tests in a state of minor damage and plan to use the specimen one
              more time for this proposed exploratory investigation. The main objective of
              this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to take the existing specimen
              which is a one story 60ft by 20 feet building and add the cable-based system to
              it  (under the existing slab) as a measure of retrofit and explore potential of
              this system in preventing progressive collapse of the existing building
              structures.
