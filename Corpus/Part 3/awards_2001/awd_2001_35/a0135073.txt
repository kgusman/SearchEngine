Abstract    :
              This project presents a career development plan for integrating research and
              education in the area of ionospheric and space remote sensing and imaging.  The
              research component is funded on developing, implementing, and integrating
              space-based/ground-based optical and radio techniques for multidimensional,
              multisensor remote sensing and imaging of ionospheric electron density
              structures, and airglow emission layers that will provide insights into many
              current ionospheric science issues: equatorial anomaly, spread-F, TIDs, gravity
              waves, and ionosphere neutral coupling at the equator.

Education through
              curriculum development, advising, mentoring, and involvement of students at
              both undergraduate and graduate levels in all aspects of research is key
              element of the proposed career development plan.  In particular, the PI is
              committed to introducing space remote sensing and imaging concepts and
              methodologies to engineering students, by developing their enthusiasm and
              inspiration for studying natural phenomena.
