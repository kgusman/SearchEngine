Abstract    :
              The National Research Council (NRC) through its Division on Engineering and
              Physical Sciences, will conduct a study to assist the National Science
              Foundation in the formulation of a comprehensive, long-term agenda for the
              earthquake engineering research that fully utilizes the capabilities of the
              George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). 
              This effort will result in a report that articulates a dynamic,
              stakeholder-inclusive process for determining research needs, identifies the
              principal issues in earthquake engineering amenable to an integrated research
              approach that incorporates analysis, computational modeling, simulation, and
              physical testing; and assesses and comments on the possible roles of
              information and communication technologies for collaborative on-site and remote
              research.  It will produce a long-term research plan based on short-,
              intermediate-, and long-term needs, general program to address them, and the
              estimated costs and benefits of the research program
