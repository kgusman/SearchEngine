History and Philosophy of the Relations
              between Evolutionary and
Developmental Biology
Ronald Amundson, University of
               Hawaii

Evolutionary developmental biology is a fast growing new field,
              stimulated by the rapid advances in molecular developmental genetics during the
              1990s.  Professional excitement is evident in the appearance of new
              professional organizations, journals, textbooks, granting programs, and even a
              new nickname, Evo Devo. But the relations between evolutionary and
              developmental biology are anything but new. They began in the 1860s with
              Darwin's earliest followers in evolutionary morphology.  Their scientific
              program ran into difficulties, and was abandoned during the 1890s. Evolutionary
              biology itself was in a period of flux and controversy until the Evolutionary
              Synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s. The Evolutionary Synthesis unified many areas
              of biology, but did not include development as a relevant factor for
              evolutionary understanding. A lively debate about the importance of development
              arose again around 1980 with equally fierce arguments from both defenders of
              the Synthesis and iconoclastic advocates of development. The current scientific
              excitement about Evo Devo comes not from the resolution of the methodological
              issues but from the promise of increasingly rich progress in developmental
              genetics.  In this project, Dr. Amundson examines the history of the debates
              about the relevance of development to evolution. He compares points of
              contention and the ways in which scientific disputes are settled. Among the key
              questions  are these:  In what ways are today's issues about development in
              biology similar to those of past debates in the 19th or mid-20th centuries?  To
              what extent do the debates depend on empirical discoveries, and to what extent
              on differences in scientific method? Will the methodological differences that
              still persist between Evo Devo and the mainstream evolutionary theory be a
              barrier to an integrated theory of evolution?  The project suggests the
              importance of philosophy and methodology in scientific debate and the
              significance of history in understanding contemporary science.
