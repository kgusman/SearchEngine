Abstract    :
              The Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Howard University is requesting
              a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to plan and execute a two-day
              conference, "Enabling a Basic Research Culture at Historically Black Colleges
              and Universities (HBCU) in the Social Sciences October 18-20, 2001.  The
              guiding principle behind the conference is that it seeks to provide an
              opportunity for young social science faculty at HBCUs to articulate their
              research goals, the potential impact of this research on their teaching and
              what is needed to facilitate and sustain a research culture at their
              institutions.   More generally, this conference is important because of its
              potential impact.  The anticipated outcome is a set of strategies that can aid
              the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other funding agencies who seek to
              achieve greater diversity (i.e., institution, gender, race and ethnicity) in
              their support of research activities in the social sciences.     The project
              proposes to identify and engage young and new social science faculty in the
              construction of strategies that will enable them to increase their
              participation in basic research.  For example, as a first step, using doctoral
              degree production data from NSF's Survey of Doctorate Recipients as a measure
              of actual or potential basic research and expertise, the investigators have
              identified a group of HBCUs who are likely to expand their social science
              research capacity with additional funding.  Within these institutions the
              investigators propose to identify young and new faculty who are currently
              engaged in research.  The focus is on new faculty because they are seen as
              having the greatest likelihood of establishing and building a research culture
              for the social sciences at these institutions through increased exposure to
              funding opportunities and networking with researchers at other HBCUs and
              majority institutions.  The conference will consist of three plenary sessions
              with researchers who have successfully secured research funding and have
              studied or participated in projects to increase minority participation in the
              nation's basic research enterprise.  Working sessions will be held to
              brainstorm and articulate what is needed to enable interested faculty at HBCU's
              to conduct basic research and to then integrate a research culture in their
              teaching activities.  A funding opportunities session will also be held with
              program directors from NSF.  Specific issues that will be addressed include: 
              (1) cultivating research capabilities in junior faculty, (2) exploiting
              mechanisms for basic research funding,  (3) the role of research in the
              primarily undergraduate institution, and (4) establishing a research culture
              for the social sciences.  The recommendations that emerge from the conference
              will be disseminated to HBCU's, NSF and other funding agencies. The ultimate
              goal is to outline strategies for a primary concern-- how both HBCU faculty and
              funding agencies can increase the number of scholars competing for research
              funds, the quality of proposals, and ultimately the success rate of
              investigators from social science scholars from HBCUs for large support
              grants.
