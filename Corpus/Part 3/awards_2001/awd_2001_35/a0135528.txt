Edition of the Correspondence of Charles
              Darwin
Duncan Porter/American Council of Learned Societies


The
              Correspondence of Charles Darwin makes available, for the first time, full,
              authoritative texts, edited according to modern textual principles and
              practices, of all the extant, known letters written and received by Charles
              Darwin. Following a comprehensive worldwide search, about 14,500 letters have
              been located.  This figure includes the letters written to Darwin. Both sides
              of the correspondence are being published in order to provide as much
              information as possible.

The Correspondence has a wide audience, including
              historians of science, philosophy, and sociology, biological and geological
              scientists, scholars of the 19th century, and general readers, for whom are
              brought together materials now dispersed among widely scattered repositories.
              Readers are instructed by the expository letters and entertained by the social
              life of the English country gentry, besides becoming better acquainted than was
              ever before possible with the life and mind of Charles Darwin. 

Prior
              support of the Darwin Correspondence Project from NSF has contributed
              substantially to the preparation and publication of two editions of "A Calendar
              of the Correspondence of Charles Darwin, 1821- 1882" (1985, 1994), twelve
              volumes of "The Correspondence of Charles Darwin" (1985, 1986, 1987, l988,
              1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2001), and "Charles Darwin's Letters:
              A Selection, 1825-1859" (1996).

The letters written during the period
              covered by this grant proposal are a part of Darwin's work  and career that has
              been comparatively unexplored and overshadowed by the publication of his "On
              the Origin of Species" (1859). However, the continuing botanical studies, the
              gathering of information for "Variation under Domestication" (1868), "The
              Descent of Man" (1871), and "The Expression of the Emotions" (1872), and the
              preparation of the fifth edition of the "Origin" (1869) are of great importance
              for the understanding of Darwin's evolutionary thinking during this important
              period of his life.  The planned research involves completion of volumes 14 to
              17, from 1866 to 1868, of the "Correspondence" during the grant period. The
              year 1868 fills two volumes because of its large number of letters. In
              addition, considerable research and editing should be accomplished on volumes
              18 to 20, from 1869 to 1871. These volumes cover Darwin's most significant
              investigations of heredity in humans, animals, and plants, yield an
              understanding of Darwin as an experimenter and innovator in plant physiology,
              psychology, and other fields, and provide extensive materials for studying the
              transformation of biological science in the nineteenth century.
