Abstract    :
              Soils constitute a huge reservoir of microbes whose activities have a profound
              impact on global warming potential, on crop productivity, and on soil fertility
              and biogeochemistry.  However, the vast majority of soil microbes remain
              uncultured, so knowledge about them is meager.  Among the major and
              consistently present, but not-yet-cultured, microbial groups identified by
              cultivation-independent molecular methods are members of the Acidobacteria,
              Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes and alpha-Proteobacteria. In an effort to move
              beyond phylogenetic recognition and enumeration of these groups to their
              functionality, a genomics approach is being conducted. A novel way was devised
              to create large (100-150 kb) insert libraries of genomic DNA from soil such
              that one end of each insert is phylogenetically informative and is flanked by a
              large portion of genomic sequence. From such libraries, clones are being
              selected that capture the phylogenetic diversity and breadth of each target
              microbial group (above) and the inserts are being sequenced to identify genes
              associated with distinctive modes of nutrition and metabolism, e.g. autotrophy,
              diazotrophy, denitrification. Between 250-750 kb of genomic information (at *
              3X coverage) can be obtained from each of 22 different not-yet-cultured soil
              microbes with the same effort required to sequence a complete 5 MB genome of a
              bacterium already in culture. From such information, the metabolic potential of
              the target organisms and their probable role(s) in soil ecosystems can be
              realized. The emerging database of sequences will help guide future work on
              these organisms, as well as ongoing efforts to obtain them in pure culture. 
              Sequence data is being made available through the Ribosomal Database Project
              (RDP) and through GenBank. In addition to providing the sequences for
              additional analyses, the RDP server will present the data in a evolutionary
              context by linkage of sequence data to an organismal phylogeny.  This is a
              Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program
              between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture
              Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.
