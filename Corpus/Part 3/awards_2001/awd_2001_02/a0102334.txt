The long
              delay in recognizing the potentially key role of Fe in coastal marine systems
              has been in large part because of the complexity of microbial:Fe interactions
              in seawater.  There still is no analytical method for determining biologically
              available Fe for either prokaryotic or eukaryotic phytoplankton.  However,
              there is evidence that Fe availability to eukaryotic phytoplankton can be
              regulated by additions of the fungal siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFB) to
              coastal waters.  The DFB-Fe complex not only is unavailable for uptake at
              significant rates, but also outcompetes the natural organic ligand classes in
              seawater for Fe.  Measurement of DFB-Fe concentrations in a titration series
              should therefore provide a first order measure of the Fe supply to
              phytoplankton.

This project will investigate the feasibility of
              miniaturizing a current bulk liquid membrane system that can actively isolate
              and concentrate 59Fe-DFB from aqueous solutions by constructing liposomes with
              the needed transport characteristics.  The high surface area and optimal
              diffusional aspects of these nanodevices will enable efficient 59Fe-DFB
              accumulations at the extremely low dissolved Fe concentrations (<1 nM)
              encountered in coastal waters.  The transport characteristics of these
              nanodevices will be measured as a function of liposome compositions and
              fabrication conditions to optimize the active transport of 59Fe-DFB from a
              seawater matrix.  If progress permits, the relationship between 59Fe
              accumulated by these nanodevices and cellular 59Fe uptake and growth of natural
              population cultures will be explored.  The immediate goal of this exploratory
              project is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing nanoscale sensors for
              quantifying the supply of Fe to eukaryotic phytoplankton in coastal seawaters. 
              The broader goal is to establish the viability of nanotechnology for sensing
              bioactive substrates in the marine realm.
