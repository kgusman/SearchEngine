This project will address statistical
              research problems in hazard-based models in the face of incomplete data and
              optimal adaptive tests for these models, by investigating conditions for their
              existence, construction and application.  Additionally, stochastic problems in
              recurrent events applications will be considered.  A new and general class of
              recurrent events analyses that will encompass the special cases now in the
              literature is proposed.  This class features models that simultaneously
              incorporate interventions as they occur and account for the effects of
              concomitant variables.  The major contributions of this project are expected to
              enhance the theoretical understanding of inferences in a variety of
              hazard-based models.

Hazard-based models have wide application.  They are
              used to understand reliability of many operations, including industrial,
              biomedical and economic.  The procedures to be developed under this grant are
              primarily for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of these
              experiences and experiments.  These models may model rare events such as
              flooding and industrial accidents, but also be appropriate for modeling
              hospital admissions and stock market cycles.  Thus, these statistical methods
              very useful for further research.  The Principal Investigator will enable many
              disadvantaged students from a large number of disciplines to participate in his
              education/research efforts.
