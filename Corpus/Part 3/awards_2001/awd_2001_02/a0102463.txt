The proposed work advances a number of research projects in
              the
area of low-dimensional topology. Their unifying theme is
              the
automorphisms of 3-dimensional manifolds, including
              homotopy
equivalences, diffeomorphisms, and isometries. Specific
              projects
include: the Generalized Smale Conjecture for elliptic
3-manifolds,
              the isomorphism problem for diffeomorphism groups of
elliptic 3-manifolds,
              generalization of the Abikoff-Maskit
structure theory for Kleinian groups
              using topological methods,
investigation of free actions of finite groups on
              orientable
handlebodies using Nielsen equivalence classes of generating
sets,
              and fibration theorems for spaces of fiber-preserving
diffeomorphisms of
              manifolds having fiberings and singular
fiberings.

The primary mathematical
              constructs that will be investigated are
3-manifolds, which are geometric
              objects locally modeled on the
3-dimensional spatial structure of the physical
              universe, and
groups, which are algebraic systems with an operation akin to
              the
addition of ordinary numbers. Some of the ongoing work has
already been
              applied in the theoretical physics of gravitation,
but most of its
              applications are entirely within pure
mathematics. The guiding philosophy of
              most of the research is to
use topological and geometric structure of
              3-manifolds to
understand groups of symmetries and other kinds
              of
automorphisms. Groups of automorphisms of a mathematical object
often
              exhibit their own interesting structure. A classic example
of this is the
              finite-dimensional vector spaces. They are rather
simple objects, but their
              automorphism groups, the general linear
groups, have a rich structure and find
              wide-ranging uses in
mathematics and physics. Within the proposed work, an
              example is
the 3-manifolds called handlebodies. These are among the
              simplest
3-manifolds to describe topologically, but their groups
              of
symmetries are subtle and varied. In fact, any finite group can
be a group
              of symmetries of some handlebody, and the number of
distinct ways that a group
              can act as symmetries on a given
handlebody can be quite large. A different
              use of the philosophy
involves Kleinian groups, which are discrete groups of
              symmetries
of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. Each Kleinian group produces
              a
quotient 3-manifold, and one of the projects uses the topological
structure
              of these quotient 3-manifolds to give an algebraic
classification of Kleinian
              groups.
