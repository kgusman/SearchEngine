Abstract for DMS - 0102776
Inverse Comparison Geometry: 
  			
Riemannian
              Comparison Theorems pertain to manifolds 
whose curvatures are bounded in some
              way, and are proven by 
comparing the geometry  to that of a well known model
              space.   
I propose the name Inverse Comparison Geometry for the 
subject of
              constructing Riemannian manifolds with prescribed 
curvature conditions. My
              proposal focuses on the problem of 
constructing manifolds of positive and
              nonnegative curvature. 
In it, I outline my plans to 
(a) find
              counterexammples to the Uniform Pinching Conjecture 
among the 3-sphere
              bundles over the 4-sphere,
(b) study two sided Cheeger perturbations of the
              metrics on 
biquotients and homogeneous spaces
(c) search for nonnegative and
              positive curvature on certain 
homotopy 5 and 6 dimensional real projective
              spaces. 
(d) construct nonnegative curvature on ``double soul
              manifolds'',
(e) study a rigid version of the ``double soul problem'',
              and
(f) prove my conjecture---that the dimension of the image of a
              
Riemannian submersion of a complete, positively curved manifold 
is strictly
              greater than half the dimension of the domain.


These problems all address
              the general question of how does 
the curvature of a space effect its geometry
              and topology? 
Roughly speaking, curvature is what determines the trigonometry
              
of a space. For example one can prove that the surface of the 
earth is
              curved with out looking at it from outer space. To do 
this have two people
              start at the north pole and travel in any 
two directions that are
              perpendicular to each other. If they 
travel at the same speed, they will
              eventually meet again at the 
south pole.  On the other hand, if the same
              experiment were 
conducted on a flat world, the two people would never meet.
              They 
would keep getting further apart, even if they never reached the
              
"edge" of the world.  The main justification for studying this 
general
              question is that it seems intrinsically beautiful, 
intriguing, and natural.
              It has a long history, that dates back to 
the 1930's work of H. Hopf, Morse,
              Schoenberg, Meyers, and Synge.
