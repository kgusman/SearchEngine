     The investigator studies constitutive relations
              for
continuum rod models of DNA and develops new tools for analyzing
the
              supercoiling and packaging of DNA and other material
filaments.  The main
              objectives of the project are to apply the
theories of statistical mechanics
              and stochastic differential
equations to develop constitutive relations for
              continuum rod
models of DNA that are provably consistent with
              detailed,
sequence-dependent structural information at the base-pair
              level;
to apply the new concept of global curvature to develop
              a
geometrically exact and computationally tractable formulation of
the
              self-contact constraint that plays a central role in the
supercoiling and
              packaging of DNA and other biological filaments;
and to develop efficient and
              provably accurate computational
methods for continuum rod models that
              faithfully respect global
geometric constraints as well as qualitative
              features of the
underlying system.
     Biologists and chemists now believe
              that the linear sequence
of base-pairs along a DNA molecule contains not only
              a genetic
code, but also a structural code that governs the
              global
organization of the molecule and its susceptibility to
interactions
              with other molecules.  An understanding of this
structural code requires
              realistic mechanical models of DNA over
a wide range of length scales.  The
              research project pursued by
the investigator is aimed at the further
              refinement of medium- to
long-scale continuum models.  In particular, methods
              are
developed for estimating local, sequence-dependent material
parameters
              and for describing global, finite-thickness effects.
Results from this
              research will be useful in developing a greater
understanding of the physical
              and mechanical properties of DNA,
in modeling how DNA may twist, bend and
              supercoil upon itself,
and in studying how DNA and other material filaments
              may be
optimally packed in confined geometries.
