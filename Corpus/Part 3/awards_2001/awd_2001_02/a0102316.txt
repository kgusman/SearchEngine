Essential
              laminations and immersed essential surfaces are two
important objects in
              3-manifolds.  They generalize embedded
incompressible surfaces, and are
              remarkably useful in obtaining
topological and geometric information of
              3-manifolds.  The main
goal of this project is to explore the relationships
              between the
topology of 3-manifolds and these two objects.  The tools
              that
the investigator will use include branched surfaces and
              immersed
branched surfaces that have been proved to be extremely useful
              in
the investigator's previous work.  The investigator intends to
continue
              his research on essential laminations and immersed
surfaces with the following
              goals.  (1) To construct essential
laminations in 3-manifolds obtained from
              Dehn surgery on
hyperbolic knots.  The techniques to be developed in
              this
research could potentially have great impact on some famous
conjectures
              in knot theory, e.g., Property P for knots and the
cabling conjecture.  (2) To
              find an algorithm to decide whether a
3-manifold is a Seifert fiber space. 
              The investigator intends to
use immersed branched surfaces and normal surface
              theory to find
a practical algorithm.  (3) To show that two homotopy
              equivalent
3-manifolds, which contain essential laminations,
              are
homeomorphic.  (4) To find an algorithm to decide whether a
3-manifold
              contains an essential lamination.

Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the
              3-dimensional space
that we are living in.  These objects can be found in many
              other
sciences, such as physics, biology, and chemistry.  A geometric
way of
              studying 3-manifolds, which is extremely fruitful, is to
view a 3-manifold as
              a collection of 3-dimensional pieces glued
together along 2-dimensional
              surfaces.  The investigator plans to
study the structure of 3-manifolds using
              such 2-dimensional
surfaces, which are called essential laminations and
              immersed
essential surfaces.  The research in this project is related to
knot
              theory, which has helped to understand the structure of DNA;
it is also
              related to hyperbolic geometry, which has been used by
physicists to
              understand the universe.
