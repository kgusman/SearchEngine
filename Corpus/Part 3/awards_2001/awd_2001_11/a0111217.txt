This grant will support the coding of data in
              the archives of the Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence. The Lemberg
              Center operated at Brandeis University from 1966-1974 and was a key site of
              research on the race-related civil disturbances of the 1960s. Since the center
              closed its doors and the prior director, John Spiegel, passed away, the
              archives of the center was presumed by many to have been discarded or lost. In
              early 1998, the main elements of the archive were re-discovered and other
              components have been located since then. The archive contains a wealth of
              previously unanalyzed data about the riots and promises greater understanding
              of the riots from a historical perspective and of collective violence and race
              relations more generally. In particular, the archives contain newspaper-based
              documentation of civil disorder events and interview tapes and
              transcripts.

The archival data could potentially inform and significantly
              modify prior understandings of these particular riots and collective violence
              more generally. In particular, the more extensive data will provide for more
              accurate modeling of the economic and structural causal mechanisms that lead to
              rioting, a better understanding of the spread of collective violence via social
              diffusion processes, additional information about the methodological and
              substantive implications of media selection processes and media description
              bias, and more direct documentation of changing racial attitudes in response to
              the rioting. To lay the foundation for that research, it will be necessary to
              translate the newspaper event record into machine-readable format.
