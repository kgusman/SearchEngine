Abstract    :
              This dissertation project examines the legal activities of a native people in
              New Spain (now, Mexico) called Tlaxcalans between 1580 and 1640 and the
              consequences of their litigiousness. During this time, the native population
              fell to its nadir, the Spanish and casta (mixed race) population increased
              dramatically, and the period of conquest and expansion was being supplanted by
              a period of administrative consolidation. This researcher hypothesizes that
              Tlaxcalans responded to these changes and adjusted their legal strategies
              accordingly. Consequently, by accommodating to the changing political
              environment, Tlaxcalans accessed new legal tools that were offered by the
              system and, in turn, shaped the political and demographic shifts within their
              community, and influenced the evolving legal system of the Spanish Empire.
              Building on the current literature in both Spanish and native history, two
              bodies of literature that rarely speak to each other, this project contributes
              to research that investigates native people's agency in historical processes
              and to literature that recasts the administration of the Spanish Empire as
              social phenomena. For this project, the researcher examines documents
              pertaining to the litigiousness of Tlaxcalans and to Spanish legal thought,
              which are found in archives in Mexico and Spain.
