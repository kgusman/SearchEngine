Abstract    :
              This collaborative infrastructure project continues the development of a
              comprehensive database for the analysis of public policy processes in the
              United States, and establishes a truly interactive application system for the
              delivery of that database to public policy scholars, students, and policy
              analysts.  The existing database is centered on lawmaking activity; the current
              project extends the work to the presidency, the executive branch, the courts,
              and interest group activity.  The database links several independent data sets
              via a system of policy content codes that are constructed to be consistent
              across time.  The approach avoids the pitfalls of relying on data collected for
              purposes other than policy monitoring.   Numerous other variables are collected
              in addition to the policy content of the cases, adding to the richness and
              flexibility of these data sets.

Data currently in the system include
              Congressional hearings (1946-1994), Public Laws (1946-1994), Congressional
              Quarterly entries (1946-1994(, all statutes enacted (1946-1994), a sample of
              stories in the New York Times (1947-1994), and Congressional Budget Authority
              (1947-1997).  The researchers add bills introduced in Congress (currently being
              integrated), legislative floor activity, executive orders and other measures of
              presidential activity, interest group activity tabulated in the Encyclopedia of
              Associations, and  Supreme Court decisions.  The investigators promise to
              explore other potential sources that contribute to the quantitative monitoring
              of public policy in the United States.

The resulting system is unique as a
              research tool because of its comprehensiveness and because of its capacity to
              allow researchers to analyze policy processes in ways that heretofore have not
              been possible.  These facets continue to improve the ability of social
              scientists to study policy dynamics and link those dynamics to the process of
              democratic governance---representation, public decision-making, political
              communication, and the operation of democratic institutions.
