Abstract    :
              Bruce Johnson of Rice University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply multiscale wavelet methods
              in quantum calculations.  Wavelets provide the multiresolution approach that
              will be brought to bear on chemical applications where either electronic or
              nuclear motions take place on more than one scale.  This characteristic
              challenges conventional quantum basis-set and grid-based methods over and above
              their limitations as far as the number of coupled degrees of freedom that can
              currently be accommodated.  Applications to recent dissociative resonance Raman
              spectroscopy (DRRS) experiments on nitrosyl chloride and ongoing experiments on
              ozone will be the focus of the initial wavelet-Schrodinger calculations. 
              Solution to the technical challenges and the development of
              freely-distributable code are expected to lead to novel outcomes which will be
              of use in other numerical and engineering wavelet applications. 

Wavelet
              methods have found much use in digital signal processing, and have much
              unrealized potential for application to complex chemical problems.  Along with
              improving the understanding of fundamental chemical dynamics, outcomes from
              this effort could have signal processing impacts in areas such as magnetic
              resonance spectroscopy.  The computer software developed in this project will
              be made freely available and is expected to be useful for engineering and other
              applications.
