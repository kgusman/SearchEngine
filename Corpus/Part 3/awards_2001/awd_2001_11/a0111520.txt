Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
              Division, Hai-Lung Dai of the University of Pennsylvania will pursue a program
              of research on the dynamics of highly vibrationally excited molecules.  This
              project will extend work on the detailed relaxation mechanisms and rates of
              very highly excited systems to low temperature and will investigate the
              underlying principles governing inelastic rovibrational processes across a
              broader kinetic energy regime of the same high vibrational level.  A second set
              of experiments uses van der Waals complexes to study energy transfer from a
              highly vibrationally excited molecule to a nearby cold molecule to gain insight
              into different coupling mechanisms, super collisions, and energy transfer in
              molecules excited at fixed energies.  Techniques such as kinetic quantum beat
              spectroscopy and time-resolved Fourier transform emission spectroscopy will be
              used to correlate the inter- and intra-molecular interactions for both types of
              experiment.  

This work will assist in understanding a wide variety of
              collisional phenomena, such as nucleation and low temperature reaction
              dynamics.  As such, this work has relevance to societal concerns such as more
              efficient combustion of fuels and problems in atmospheric chemistry such as the
              formation and destruction of the Arctic and Antarctic ozone holes.
