ABSTRACT OF PROPOSED WORK

Understanding the sequential
              rupture of faults is one of the fundamental goals in earthquake science. 
              Simply stated, the question is: How do ruptures repeat on a fault and on
              systems of faults?  Although this question is at the heart of both practical
              and academic aspects of our science, it remains largely unanswered, mostly
              because data are difficult to obtain.  Three of the most important issues are
              1) How regular are intervals between fault ruptures? 2) How repeatable is the
              pattern of slip on a fault? 3) How does geologic structure influence fault
              rupture?  These are questions we propose to begin to tackle through
              paleoseismic and neotectonic studies in Taiwan. 
During our first year, our
              reconnaissance work would focus on paleoseismic investigations along the 1999
              rupture of the Chelungpu fault and on preparation of a neotectonic and
              earthquake source map of all of Taiwan.  The record of prehistoric seismicity
              along the Chelungpu at one site we hope to begin to test a few plausible
              hypotheses, ranging from unpatterned or random recurrence to highly clustered
              behavior.  If successful, our work will justify continued work on understanding
              of earthquake faults and provide constraints on theoretical models of fault
              interaction.  Our neotectonic earthquake source map will provide the context
              for future studies of fault behavior there.
