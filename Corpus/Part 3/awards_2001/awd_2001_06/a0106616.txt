This is a U.S.-Polish collaborative research project
              to support the participation of Polish scientists in DYCOMS-11 (Dynamics and
              Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus) scheduled for July 2001.  The principal
              investigator, Marcin Szumowski, is from the University of Nevada Desert
              Research Institute.  His Polish collaborators, Szymon Malinowski and Krzysztof
              Haman, are from the Institute of Geophysics at Warsaw University.

The
              researchers will use a suite of high-frequency instruments developed in the
              last decade to simultaneously measure the temperature, cloud liquid water
              content, and microphysical structure within the cloud.  This suite of
              instruments has never been used simultaneously before and has the potential to
              create an unprecedented robust data set characterizing the entrainment process
              and its effects on cloud microphysical evolution with very fine spatial
              resolution.   

This project in atmospheric sciences research fulfills the
              program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and
              Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
