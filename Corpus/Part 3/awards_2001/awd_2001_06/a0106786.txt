Title: A Seismic Study of the
              Taiwan Orogen

This is a
              seismic study of the Taiwan orogen, an important case of active collision zone
              that has been a focus of international research for the last 20 years. Since
              the devastating Chi-Chi earthquake sequence of 1999, seismicity increased
              remarkably in and around Taiwan. Hundreds of large- to moderate-sized
              earthquakes have been well recorded by arrays of state-of-the-art instruments,
              providing high-resolution data to investigate active arc-continent
              collision.

We plan to study about 300 earthquakes, including precise
              determinations of epicenters, focal depths, fault plane solutions, and seismic
              moments, in order to address some key questions in active collision. The young
              age and fast convergence of the collision zone are particularly favorable for
              resolving: 1) if spatial variations reflect time-progression of collision; and
              2) if reactivation of pre-existing, extensional structures is important in the
              early stages of collision. We will focus on these topics and cast our
              interpretation in the context of geological and geophysical information
              gathered from various sources.

In addition, we will study diffuse
              deformation to the east of the suture zone, in the interior of the western
              Philippine Sea. Recent marine data showed a surprisingly old age (early
              Cretaceous) for the colliding edge of the Philippine Sea. This region,
              underlain by oceanic lithosphere, is often assumed to be mechanically strong,
              thus behaving as the driving edge of the collision. The proposed work will
              constrain the thickness of the strongest part of the colliding oceanic
              lithosphere, and potentially provide clues to the anomalously shallow depth of
              the old sea floor.
