The Dead Sea Fault System (DSFS) is one of
              the largest continental strike-slip faults in the world.  As the transform
              plate boundary between the Arabian and African plates, the DSFS represents a
              key tectonic feature in the eastern Mediterranean region.  Despite its tectonic
              significance, the understanding of the DSFS as an active, seismogenic structure
              is relatively limited, particularly along the central and northern sections of
              the fault in Syria and Lebanon.  Through an interdisciplinary study of DSFS in
              Syria and Lebanon, the ongoing research is addressing several important issues
              including:

(1) Whether or not northern DSFS deformation fully accounts for
              Arabia-Africa plate motions and, hence, represents the present-day plate
              boundary.
(2) How predictions of northward increase in slip rate and
              fault-normal convergence (suggested by plate tectonic models) are reflected in
              DSFS kinematics.
(3) The role of earthquakes in plate boundary deformation
              along a major continental transform (the DSFS) including fault segmentation and
              aseismic strain release.
(4) The relationship of internal deformation of the
              adjacent Arabian plate to kinematic variations along the DSFS, and the
              connection between the DSFS and the Arabian-Eurasian collision.

In order to
              bridge the critical gap that typically exists between neotectonic and
              geodetic/seismological assessments of strain, results of this neotectonic and
              geodetic work are currently integrated with a lengthy, well-documented
              historical record of large earthquakes (approximately M > 6.5) spanning at
              least the past 2,000 years.  Such a lengthy historical record spanning multiple
              earthquake cycles is generally unavailable along almost any other major plate
              boundary.

To address the issues outlined above, the following is being
              accomplished:

(1) Regional mapping of the active branches of the DSFS using
              all available remote sensing data (including aerial photos and a
              high-resolution elevation models produced using InSAR) to determine geometric
              (and possible seismogenic) segments.
(2) Local studies of key fault segments
              (detailed mapping, surveying fault-related landforms, and paleoseismic studies)
              in order to delimit: long-term fault slip rates and kinemetrics (103 - 106
              years); earthquake histories and recurrence over many earthquake cycles
              (Holocene to present), and; past earthquake sizes and their distribution along
              fault segments.  Historical earthquake data place further limits on earthquake
              size and recurrence during the past ~2,000 years.
(3) Tectonic geodesy
              (primarily GPS) in the far-field and near-field to determine short-term rates
              of fault slip and kinematics (several years), possible aseismic slip vs. strain
              accumulation, and possible internal deformation of the northern Arabian
              plate.

Integrating and modeling neotectonic, geodetic, and historical data
              for the DSFS provide new insight on the kinematics and dynamics of DSFS with
              broader implications for active strike-slip faults, in general.  Furthermore,
              the results of this study have significance for regional earthquake hazard
              assessment in Syria and Lebanon, as well as neighboring countries, where large,
              rapidly expanding populations heighten the need for accurate earthquake hazard
              assessments.  The collaborative study builds upon past and ongoing joint
              research involving Cornell, MIT, IPG Strasbourg, and Syrian and Lebanese
              institutions.


(4) The relationship of internal deformation of the adjacent
              Arabian plate to kinematic variations along the DSFS, and the connection
              between the DSFS and the Arabian-Eurasian collision.
