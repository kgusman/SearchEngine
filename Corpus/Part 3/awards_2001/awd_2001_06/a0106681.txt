Since the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the sediment
              yields from watersheds draining its slopes have been the highest ever recorded.
               In spite of this overwhelming sediment load, rivers inundated by pyroclastic
              flow deposits efficiently delivered almost half of the initial deposits to
              downslope alluvial/debris fans by 1996.  Much of this transport occurs by
              lahars and hyperconcentrated flow, but at low to moderate flow the channels
              provide end-member examples of channel response to high sediment supply.  A
              program of field measurements in 1997 and 1998 documented extremely high
              bedload transport rates even at low flow due to enhanced mobility of particles
              moving over a smooth, fine-grained bed.  Measurement of flow velocities and
              depths, channel properties, and the size of both mobile and stable clasts in
              the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers indicates grain-size-independent
              dimensionless critical shear stresses of 0.015 to 0.038, and Manning's n values
              of 0.017 to 0.024, well below values previously reported for steep mountain
              channels.  The dramatic bed mobility and selective transport in these extremely
              sediment-rich channels indicate that changes in grain size, and bed roughness
              can increase transport capacity in response to high sediment supply. 
              Dimensionless bedload transport rates in the Pasig-Potrero River are
              substantially greater than those previously reported for temperate rivers at
              the same dimensionless shear stress.  
Over the course of three field seasons,
              we propose to test a series of hypotheses for river response to changes in
              sediment supply using this ongoing natural experiment.  Specifically, we will
              monitor channel response to the progressive decline in sediment supply to
              evaluate the hypotheses that: (i) bed coarsening and armoring is occurring in
              response to decreased sediment delivery from hillslopes and valley walls and
              will lead to a change in the character of bedload transport from selective
              mobility to threshold mobility; (ii) that recovery of an armored, threshold
              mobility bed in the Pasig-Potrero River will occur faster than in the Sacobia
              River due to differences in watershed recovery and relative transport capacity;
              (iii) that the magnitude and rates of changes in the bed surface texture in
              rivers draining the flanks of Mount Pinatubo track differences in initial
              sediment loading of their watersheds by pyroclastic flow deposits; and (iv)
              that pebble cluster formation is a mechanism of channel response to declining
              sediment load that, in turn, leads to changes in the style of bed mobility and
              bedload transport rates.
