Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Miami University in Oxford will
              acquire a 400 MHz solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)spectrometer.
              This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the
              characterization of the membrane-bound protein phospholamban; b) an
              investigation of the structure and mechanism of action of CREP-1; c) an
              examination of the metalloenzyme metallo-beta-lactamase, believed responsible
              for antibiotic resistance in bacteria; d) organically modified polymers and
              their use in combinatorial chemistry; e) influence of dendrimers on sol-gel
              materials; and f) development of novel packing materials for chromatographic
              separations.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
              particular, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry and materials chemistry.
