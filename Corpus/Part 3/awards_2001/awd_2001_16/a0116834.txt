Abstract    :
              This three-day conference will provide a forum for in-depth dialogue on
              innovative research in the area of Neural Control of Behavior.  The first two
              days will be devoted to a symposium that will be open to the scientific
              community.  There will be four sessions: Neurosecretion Over Different Time
              Domains; Genetic Dissection of Behavior; Local Protein Synthesis During
              Neuronal Plasticity and Regeneration; and Learning and Memory: New Directions. 
              The speakers will discuss a wide spectrum of species (use of invertebrates to
              mammals) and experimental approaches (from molecular and cellular to behavioral
              levels of analyses).  The third day of the meeting will be devoted to a
              workshop among only the speakers, where they will explore ways in which
              information discussed during the symposium can be used to take their respective
              research areas in new directions.  This conference aims to: Bring together
              researchers who are asking similar questions, but are using different species
              and different experimental approaches; Promote the use of simple systems for
              addressing complex biological problems; Promote interaction between junior
              scientists - women in particular - and established investigators and leaders in
              the field. The speakers use modern, cutting-edge technologies for addressing
              problems in the area of Neural Control of Behavior.  By bringing together these
              researchers, and giving them a forum for discussing their work, the message can
              be effectively spread that these modern techniques are being used with great
              success in a wide variety of animal systems.  This conference will provide an
              important interdisciplinary communications-mechanism for advancements in the
              neuroscience community.
