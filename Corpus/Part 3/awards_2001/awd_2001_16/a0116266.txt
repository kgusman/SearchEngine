Abstract    :
              The initial annotation of the complete sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana
              indicates that of the 11,601 distinct gene types found, only 35% are
              represented in the genome by one gene, while 37% are represented by gene
              families with five or more different members. For a majority of the larger gene
              families, the molecular function of the encoded proteins is known.  However,
              the role of individual gene family members in specific physiological or
              development pathways is often uncertain.  The focus of this project is to
              develop protocols to assist in describing the in planta function of individual
              gene family members in the AHA,  Arabidopsis plasma membrane H+-ATPase, gene
              family.
The AHA genes code for proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to proton
              transport across the plasma membrane of plant cells. The proton-motive force
              produced by the ATPases then drives the transport of solutes via carriers and
              channels. In Arabidopsis, the proton pumps comprise a gene family with at least
              twelve gene isoforms. Expressed in different tissues, the pumps provide the
              underlying energy for a variety of fundamental plant processes such as cellular
              homeostasis, mineral and metabolite transport, cell growth and plant
              morphogenesis, and a variety of responses to the environment including stomatal
              control, tropic responses, and defense related mechanisms. 
As a first step
              towards determining the function of the AHA genes, we have screened over 80,000
              Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines and have identified twenty-nine mutants. 
              
This collection of mutants includes ten of twelve AHA gene family members,
              with multiple alleles for many isoforms. Exhaustive screening of the current
              80,000 lines and screening of recently available lines should make it possible
              to reach the goal of finding multiple alleles for each gene family member. To
              understand the role these genes individually and in the gene family, we will
              take the following approaches:
 
-  We will isolate, outcross and prepare aha
              mutant lines for analysis and distribution to the Arabidopsis Biological
              Resource Center, Columbus, OH 43210. 

- We will perform genetic crosses and
              create multiple insert lines (i.e., double, triple mutants, etc.) in order to
              uncover genetic redundancy in the gene family.  

- We will test for
              conditional phenotypes in the mutant AHA lines by comparing mutants to
              wild-type plants under conditions designed to reveal differences in
              development, responses to environmental stimuli, nutrient uptake, etc. 

- We
              will establish an on-line database of experimental conditions designed for a
              broad range of phenotypic analysis. Preliminary protocols will be available
              Year 1, first quarter.  Detailed protocols and associated data will be added as
              it is generated. 

The availability of twenty-nine AHA gene-family mutant
              alleles provides the raw materials for substantial progress into the function
              of the AHA genes and gene family. The availability of this resource at a
              predominantly undergraduate institution provides a means of integrating genomic
              scale research with undergraduate training.
