The central idea of this proposal is a mathematical
              
definition for the physicists' notion of topological 
gravity (analogous to
              Segal's mathematical definition of 
conformal field theory) as a
              representation of a monoidal 
category with manifolds as objects, using the
              geometric 
realization of a category of cobordisms between those 
objects as
              its morphism spaces; these spaces are unions of 
classifying spaces for the
              diffeomorphism groups of the 
cobordisms. In two dimensions, the resulting
              category 
is quite similar to that considered by Segal, but it 
generalizes
              very naturally, e.g. to four dimensions, 
where it has close connections with
              classical general 
relativity; but there is also a version for topological
              
(i.e, non-smooth) four-manifolds, lacking any clear 
classical analog.
              Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten theory fit 
naturally into this framework, which
              predicts that such 
invariants should have higer-order `gravitational
              
descendants', e.g. higher-codimension versions of the 
wall-crossing
              obstructions. In dimension two, this formalism 
fits in well on the one hand
              with work of Madsen and 
Tillmann on Mumford's conjecture, and on the other
              with the 
theory of a `large' quantum cohomology studied by Kontsevich,
              
Manin, Witten, and others. One concrete goal of the project
is to construct
              a cohomological theory related to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta-invariant of a
              three-manifold, 
as Casson's invariant is related to Floer homology.  
              

Classical mechanics studies the trajectories of point 
particles in a
              smooth geometric background, and much 
recent work in string theory can be
              formulated in similar 
terms, with the background replaced by the
              
(infinite-dimensional) space of smooth loops in some 
ambient manifold. 
              However, the mathematics of these 
free loopspaces is quite challenging, and
              their topology 
(not to mention their geometry) is not yet
              well-understood.
An added complication is that the models studied in 
quantum
              field theory involve topology change in a 
conceptually intrinsic way, and
              thus seem often to call, 
not for the free loopspace itself, but for a
              suitable
completion with nice properties -- whose nature is still 
being
              worked out.  This proposal suggests that the desired 
completion is an analog,
              for free loopspaces, of the dual 
of a finite-dimensional smooth manifold (as
              studied in the 
1960's by Whitehead, Spanier, Atiyah, and others). This
              
point of view seems compatible with work of Chas and 
Sullivan on string
              topology, with work of Cohen, Jones, 
and Segal on Floer homotopy type, and
              with work of Ando 
and myself on the Witten genus.
