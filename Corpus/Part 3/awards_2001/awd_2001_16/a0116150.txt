Abstract    :
              This grant supports the acquisition of a multi-channel biomagnetometer system
              for Magnetic Source Imaging (MSI). This system will be used for non-invasive
              recording of magnetic signals emitted naturally by the human brain during
              performance of sensory-motor, cognitive and linguistic tasks, and for
              constructing functional images of brain activation. These images reflect the
              spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity mediating the psychological and
              behavioral functions required by the experimental tasks. During the past three
              years, we have used MSI to establish (i) the reliability and validity of
              functional maps of the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive functions,
              including motor, somatosensory, and receptive language (Breier et al., 1999a,b;
              Breier et al., 2000, in press; Papanicolaou et al., 1999; Simos, 1998a,b;
              1999a,b; 2000a). These maps have proven so accurate that MSI is routinely used
              in our institution for outlining the borders of language-specific cortex in
              neurosurgical candidates in order to avoid damage to normally functioning
              neural mechanisms during resection of brain lesions lying close to these areas
              of the brain, thus reducing post-operative morbidity. (ii) We have accumulated
              sufficient data for constructing reliable maps of brain mechanisms associated
              with reading and phonological decoding in adults (Breier et al., 1998, 1999c,
              Simos et al., 1998a, 2000a, in press) and in school-age children (Simos et al.,
              2000b,c, in press) as well as kindergarten children learning to read. (iii) We
              have identified brain activation maps specific to children with identified
              reading difficulties and children at-risk for developing reading difficulties.
              We are following these children as they learn to read through different
              instructional methods to determine how these maps change with improved reading
              proficiency (Simos et al., 2000b,c,d).

These discoveries led us to consider
              a host of experimental questions ranging from the layout of the mechanisms of
              oral and written language in the brains of bilingual and polyglot children and
              adults to questions regarding the formation of such mechanisms in the course of
              brain maturation and development, and to questions relating to specific
              spatio-temporal activation patterns underlying component cognitive and
              linguistic functions. We have begun addressing these questions with the support
              of several NSF and NIH grants (NSF grant #9979968; NIH grants RO1 NS37941 and
              RO1 HD38346) using a 148-channel biomagnetometer acquired for clinical studies
              belonging to Hermann Hospital. Not surprisingly, the use of that system for the
              conduct of basic research involving normal volunteers and children has become
              problematic. The system we will purchase will be located on the U of Texas-
              Houston campus, outside Hermann Hospital, and will be exclusively used for
              basic research involving children and adults.

Our group has advanced MSI
              technology, especially in areas involving higher cortical functions. We have
              developed specific applications to education, literally bringing neuroscience
              into public schools. In order to continue to advance the technology and expand
              educational and training applications, a MSI laboratory dedicated to research
              is needed, leading to this grant under the Major Research Instrumentation
              Program.
