Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
Despite increased emphasis on environmental chemistry across the
              curriculum at Georgia Southern University, non-major students and chemistry
              majors are not receiving meaningful, real world analysis experience in this
              vital area. This project seeks to remedy this situation by providing portable
              field instrumentation appropriate for use by lower level and senior students
              alike, as well as modern technology for the analysis of regionally relevant
              environmental pollutants. The project adapts initiatives undertaken at Western
              Carolina University (NSF 9750583), Roanoke College (NSF 9850796) and Emory and
              Henry College (NSF 9851010). By allowing students access to these changes in
              the curriculum, we:
1. Expose them to modern methods of environmental
              analysis,
2. Allow for on-site testing, with all its inherent challenges,
              and
3. Stimulate student interest through examination of local issues/problems
              and development of critical thinking skills as they analyze the ramifications
              on their own lives.
Students gain a solid understanding of environmental
              testing techniques, awareness of the importance of environmental stewardship,
              and enhanced data analysis and report preparation skills as they undertake
              studies on total ecosystem quality. This is accomplished through intensive
              field studies, coupled with advanced laboratory experiences for upper level
              students. Georgia Southern educates significant numbers of minority and female
              students, and a new core requirement in environmental science ensures inclusion
              of students of virtually all major degree programs. The Chemistry Department
              has established collaborations with area water treatment plants, wildlife
              rehabilitation centers, sanitary landfill operators, and agricultural extension
              agents, thus providing a variety of appropriate field locations for student
              investigations. The newly-acquired equipment reflects modern technology and
              thus provides students with current practical experience.
