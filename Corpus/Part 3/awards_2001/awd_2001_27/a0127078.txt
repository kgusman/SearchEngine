Abstract    :
              Physics (13)

This project is restructuring the modern physics laboratory
              course at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne to provide students
              with experience with in-depth investigations. Six tracks of four experiments
              each are being developed. These tracks are (1) Lasers and Spectroscopy I, (2)
              Interferometry and Fourier Analysis, (3) Lasers and Spectroscopy II, (4)
              Magnetic Resonance, (5) Nuclear Spectroscopy, and (6) Molecular Spectroscopy.
              The experiments within a track use the same, or similar, equipment and concepts
              throughout. This allows students to become sufficiently familiar with the
              concepts and equipment so that they can be given more responsibility and
              freedom as they proceed through the track to design the investigation, collect
              appropriate data, and analyze the data.

The project is adapting and
              implementing four major elements. (1) It is adapting procedures for fostering
              independence in experimental design and analysis learned from a Course,
              Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) project conducted by co-PIs
              Masters and Maloney (Award No. 9950511, "Improving Conceptual Understanding and
              Complex Problem Solving in General Physics"). (2) From professional practice,
              the project is adapting the practice of having students present poster sessions
              to classmates and faculty. (3) Also from professional practice, the project is
              implementing LabView software to introduce students to a standard of the
              industrial workplace. (4) The project is adapting much of the software from the
              Visual Quantum Mechanics project (Award No. 9452782) as an independent study
              resource for students.
