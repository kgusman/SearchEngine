Abstract    :
              This project falls into the New Development track of the program guidelines. An
              assessment tool is being developed that can be used as both a diagnostic tool
              and a measurement of instructional effects, with primary focus on student
              conceptual understanding in the geosciences. Conceptual understanding and
              change are being targetted for two reasons. First, conceptual understanding
              implies both a familiarity with content and the ability to apply it to complex
              questions. Second, a number of studies have suggested that prior knowledge can
              be as important to understanding as pedagogy. As such, students' personal
              understanding of Earth systems may impact the way in which they understand and
              retain the formal geoscience they are exposed to. The primary goal of this
              study is the dissemination of a reliable and valid assessment tool to
              geoscience faculty around the nation, for use in general education and
              introductory geoscience courses, as a means of both diagnosing student
              preconceptions and assessing one aspect of course effectiveness. This test can
              thus be used as a cross-course, cross-university assessment instrument and as a
              means for comparing a variety of instructional styles and other variables,
              including disparate student outcomes related to characteristics such as age and
              gender. This goal will be achieved by:   1. Identification of alternative
              conceptions of geological processes through a comprehensive literature search
              and interviews with students. Geoscience covers a range of interdisciplinary
              studies, and we have narrowed our focus to three dimensions: Earth's crust
              (including topographic expression and geographic expression), Earth's interior,
              and Earth through time. Roughly 70 student interviews will be conducted at four
              different institutions with dissimilar student populations; 2. Development of
              a multiple-choice conceptual assessment tool using commonly held misconceptions
              as distractors. These misconceptions will be catalogued from the
              student interviews described above; and 3. Qualitative and statistical
              validation of the assessment tool, to ensure robustness as a comparative
              instrument. We will ensure both validity, the ability of a test to measure a
              specific characteristic, and reliability, the internal consistency of the test
              items and test reproducibility, of this test. Reliability and validity will be
              ensured through initial piloting with novice students, educators and expert
              geoscientists, and Item Response Theory statistics.  The availability of an
              assessment tool involving fundamental conceptions in geology will be invaluable
              for university faculty interested in assessing introductory and non-major
              courses in the geosciences. Additionally, the use of misconceptions as
              distractors allows interested faculty to use the pre-test as a diagnostic tool,
              to determine the kinds of alternative ideas held by their students. Teachers
              can then modify course structures to specifically target these preconceptions.
              Finally, the availability of a standard test will allow geoscience faculty to
              compare courses at different universities, and in so doing allow a basis by
              which different instructors, teaching methodologies, curriculum, and
              technologies can be compared. This type of evaluation is critical if we are
              ever truly going to answer the question "What works in the geoscience
              classroom?"
