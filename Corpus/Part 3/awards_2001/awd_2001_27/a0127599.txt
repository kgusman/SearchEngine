Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) Biological research has moved from the laboratory bench
              to the desktop computer. However, bioinformatics, the use of information
              technology to manage, store, and analyze biological data, is seldomly used in
              the biology classroom. Not only is it important for students to develop
              research skills in this area, but engaging in these types of activities gives
              students a better understanding of molecular biology. This project enables
              college and high school instructors to use bioinformatics in life science
              courses by addressing the lack of "classroom-ready" materials. The project is
              developing instructional materials that focus primarily on teaching students
              how to use the databases and analysis tools available at the National Center
              for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Students learn fundamental concepts in
              biology through the use of bioinformatics tools to perform novel experiments.
              Products of the project include: 1) a textbook/laboratory manual written from
              the perspective of how biologists use bioinformatics and providing an overview
              of the field and fifteen to twenty different experiments designed to help
              students develop skills in this area; 2) an instructor's manual to help
              instructors interpret results and including guidelines for implementation and
              inquiry-based activities; 3) a CD-ROM supplement containing data sets and
              examples that demonstrate how the laboratories work; and 4) on-line, animated,
              tutorials designed for novice users and made available through the education
              page at the NCBI web site.
