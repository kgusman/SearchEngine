              Lay Abstract- Behavioral Ecology of Hydrodynamic Pressure Waves  	Aquatic
              pressure waves occur in the form of surface waves, such as ripples, underwater
              pressure waves, and underwater sound waves. Pressure waves can be produced
              abiotically by wind, currents, and moving objects, and biotically by animal and
              plant movements. Surface waves can often be relatively long-range, such as when
              ripples produced in a calm lake travel many meters, and as they travel, they
              induce traveling pressure waves beneath them. Underwater pressure waves are
              usually short range, i.e., within 2 meters. Sound waves are normally
              long-range. The great majority of all studies on surface and underwater
              pressure waves have been done in the laboratory and at close range, within
              about 40 cm. This project will examine a set of interactions between
              invertebrate and vertebrate predators which are mediated by pressure waves, at
              longer range, in the field. The project will be focused on interactions between
              1) fresh-water bass and minnows, where bass sense the presence of unseen
              minnows by the swimming motions of the minnows; 2) feeding trout and their
              response to ripples induced by swimming beavers (nonpredators) versus otters
              (predators); and 3) ocean-living mantis shrimp, which defend burrows in part by
              sensing the approach of intruder shrimp by the pressure waves and/or sound made
              by the approach of the intruders. In all cases, pressure waves will be recorded
              and analyzed, then played back, to determine the response of the receivers to
              various pressure waves. As long-range surface wave interactions have never been
              studied, these data especially will aid in determining the role the pressure
              waves play in the invertebrate and vertebrate species in the field.
