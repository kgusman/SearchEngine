Abstract    :
              Abstract: This research effort will explore a multi-agent negotiation-based
              approach to traffic management and route guidance. In the proposed multi-agent
              system called Cooperative Transportation Management and Route Guidance System
              (CTMRGS), IRANS (In-vehicle Routing and Navigation Systems) and ISPs
              (Information Service Providers) are represented as agents. The idea is to allow
              all drivers and their IRANS to have the ability to choose, make, and pay for a
              safe, efficient, cost-effective trip. Each IRANS agent negotiates with the ISP
              agents about the trip for a minimal change in the preferred routes and thus
              ensures that the driver will comply with it.  The ISP agents inform network
              managers with the anticipated road usages in exchange for the current traffic
              conditions to be used in the ISP's negotiation model. The proposed negotiation
              is based on a new principled negotiation based approach that is significantly
              different from other multi-agent negotiation and bargaining approaches (e.g.,
              contract-net) discussed in the literature. Therefore negotiation is not
              entirely based on individual agent's utility maximization criteria. The agents
              exchange their objective criteria before they negotiate for routes so that each
              other's objectives are included in the route generation and alteration
              functions. The proposed multi-agent system is compliant with ATIS6 market
              package for Integrated Transportation Management/Route Guidance with specific
              focus on overcoming drivers' non-compliance hurdles present in the current
              ATIS6 package.
