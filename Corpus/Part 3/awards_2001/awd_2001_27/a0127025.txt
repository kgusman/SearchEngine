Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
The project is addressing known and significant deficiencies in
              the way undergraduate students are educated in the chemical sciences by
              implementing a teaching and learning environment in which the boundaries
              between lecture and laboratory are eliminated. Building on our preliminary
              work, we are modifying the Studio-Laboratory concept pioneered by Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute and California Polytechnic State University, and elements
              from NSF-CCLI awards (9951346; 9950501; 9952732; 9972293) for our analytical
              and honors-level chemistry courses. This provides a teaching and learning
              environment which addresses our students' difficulty in making higher-level
              connections between theory and practice, and improves the laboratory technique
              they exhibit in quantitative experimentation. Central to this endeavor is the
              change from supervision and assessment of "canned" experiments to an
              inquiry-based study of real-world problems and laboratory techniques. A number
              of novel technological features are being incorporated into our version of the
              Studio-Laboratory which is divided into stations. Each station, serving up to
              four students, supports two computers and data interfaces (Vernier Lab Pro) and
              a diode-array UV-VIS spectrometer. Each group of four stations (a cluster)
              shares an FT-IR spectrophotometer. The instructor serves as an "expert-mentor"
              and "guide" to provide an inquiry-based learning environment rich in real world
              content and laboratory techniques. WebCT augments the instructor by serving as
              the gateway to the educational media under development. On-demand video,
              conceptual animations, and self-paced learning assignments are being designed
              specifically to help our students build higher-level connections between theory
              and practice, particularly those who are more visual learners and those
              requiring additional reinforcement or support. Workshops are being offered to
              faculty and staff from all universities and colleges in Michigan's Upper
              Peninsula in order to introduce the university community to the
              Studio-Laboratory concept. Additional workshops will be held for high school
              teachers.
