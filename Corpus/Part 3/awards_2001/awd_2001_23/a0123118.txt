Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to investigate oxygen atom reactions on dust and ice surfaces
              characteristic of particles in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). 
              Atomic oxygen is the most abundant reactive species in this altitude range, and
              its reactions on and with surfaces may contribute significantly to the
              chemistry in the MLT.  Ice particles present in the mesosphere are observed as
              noctilucent clouds (NLCs), polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), and polar
              mesospheric summer echoes (PMSEs).  The initial reaction to be studied is the
              heterogeneous recombination of atomic oxygen on ice under conditions
              representative of the mesosphere (80-90 km) -a phenomenon suggested by recent
              rocket measurement of atomic oxygen profiles during NLC events.  Other
              heterogeneous reaction schemes suggested in the literature that involve oxygen
              atom reactions with hydrogen molecules, oxygen molecules, and ice surfaces will
              then be explored.

This proposal was submitted by the PI, Dr. Jochen
              Marschall, for James E. Boulter, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
