Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation NSF 01-65 on
              "Ultra-High Capacity Optical Communications and Networking." The objective of
              the proposed research is conversion of ultra-high bitrates of electrical data
              to optical signals.  The goal of the proposed research is demonstration of GaN
              unipolar lasers operating at C-, L- and S-band wavelengths, exhibiting a direct
              modulation bandwidth between 100-250 GHz.  This goal will be pursued by
              elimination of the principle source of speed limitation in conventional bipolar
              structures exhibiting ten's of GHz bandwidth.  Until recently, all
              semiconductor lasers utilized both holes and electrons for stimulated emission.
               The low field transport of holes in the active region of such lasers limits
              the direct modulation bandwidth.  A unipolar laser which can be modulated at
              speeds limited only by very fast high field electron transport and parasitic RC
              time constants is proposed.  
Quantum cascade lasers and LEDs made from
              GaN-based semiconductor materials will be designed, fabricated and
              characterized.  This form of laser utilizes only n-type, and undoped, material
              to inject electrons into an upper confined quantum well state followed by an
              optical transition to a lower energy state.
The proposed technology could also
              see application to 100-250 GHz bandwidth modulators and detectors.  These
              lasers will also be valuable as high power IR lasers for such applications as
              1480nm pump lasers.  High temperature operation of GaN has been demonstrated in
              FETs where channel temperatures of 300 C are possible due to the wide bandgap
              and good thermal conductivity of GaN.  Superior chemical stability will permit
              much higher optical output powers without laser mirror degradation compared to
              the arsenide-phosphide laser materials.
These broad bandwidth lasers would
              dramatically reduce number of active and passive elements required for
              achieving a desired system capacity.  In optical architectures where 2N or N2
              elements are required, moving from 20 Gbit/second today to 120 Gbit/sec with
              GaN quantum cascade lasers could reduce optical systems parts count by figures
              between 12 and 36.
