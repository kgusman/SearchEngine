Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
              science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
              of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at
              the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional
              practices, policies, climate and culture. Through the Leadership Education for
              Advancement and Promotion Program (LEAP), the University of Colorado seeks to
              transform the makeup of the science and engineering faculties at the University
              of Colorado, Boulder, and to increase the number of women trained in the
              scientific, mathematical, engineering, and technology (SMET) disciplines
              serving in key administrative positions. The University of Colorado, Boulder
              seeks to improve the environment for all faculty members, by improving the
              level of managerial and leadership skills possessed by the faculty. Providing
              all the tools needed to work effectively will reduce the stresses commonly
              associated with achieving tenure. LEAP will therefore accelerate the promotion
              rate of women faculty by increasing retention rates and making their
              environment more supportive. The program is designed to keep faculty members on
              track for tenure, to identify potential leaders, and to give people more
              leadership opportunities.  The program is designed to work with efforts
              already underway at the University of Colorado.  Formative evaluation of the
              program will maximize the effectiveness of the funds used over the lifetime of
              the program. At the end of the five-year period  the University of Colorado,
              Boulder expects to have more women in leadership positions in the University.
              In addition, they will have trained a cadre of faculty better able to pursue
              long term change, and have developed an effective way to continue to train
              faculty for success. This program will permanently impact the institution and
              the changes it initiates will be self-sustainable through internal
              support.  This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall
              mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the
              scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and
              advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.
