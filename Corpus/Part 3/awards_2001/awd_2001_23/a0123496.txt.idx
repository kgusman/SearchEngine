Abstract    :
              0123496 Khammash  The objective of the proposed research is to study examples
              of biological feedback regulation mechanisms using the tools of dynamical
              systems and feedback control theory, and to use the results to shed new
              understanding on the operation of these systems in health and disease. In
              achieving this objective, The PI seeks to identify functional modules that
              serve specific feedback control roles, to determine the physiological basis of
              these modules, and to understand the extent to which such modules generalize to
              other regulatory systems and across hierarchical scales. These questions are
              key in addressing the long-term objective to develop a unified framework for
              analyzing homeostatic mechanisms--one that is centered on feedback control
              theory concepts and language, and takes into account known physiology. It is
              believed that such a framework will make it possible to make new progress in
              the understanding of those complex biological and chemical processes involved
              in homeostasis and the functional modules that these processes constitute,
              based on the functional constraints that are imposed on these modules by the
              necessities of feedback and robustness.
