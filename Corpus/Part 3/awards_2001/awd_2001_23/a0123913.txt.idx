Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is on the development of multinational student/faculty
              project-based approaches to integrating research and education. Most major
              practical problems, such as environment, public health and the access to
              technology, are inherently interdisciplinary and are shared across national
              boundaries. Internationally, we also face the challenge of transforming higher
              education itself to become more accessible and more responsive to the needs of
              our communities. Faculty at the University of Washington have been working  on
              models for coupling collaborative multinational research addressing common
              scientific and engineering challenges to mutual assistance in the reform of our
              institutions. The essence of this approach is to tap into the rich and vibrant
              spectrum of international research and service activities, which are at the
              very heart of faculty interests and enthusiasms, while simultaneously creating
              opportunities that can be embedded in the core of undergraduate curricula. The
              current project builds on work to date in this promising arena by creating a
              small alliance of universities, both within the US and worldwide, which will
              collaborate on further refining, scaling-up, and institutionalizing this
              approach to integrating international research, education and service. There
              are several design features to this multinational project-based strategy. 
              Prioritized projects : 1) Are embedded in genuine faculty research interests on
              all sides; 2) Can take place within curricular structures that affect large
              numbers of undergraduate students on all sides, rather than the fortunate few;
              3) Contribute to the solution of practical regional problems, and 4) Invoke
              deep partnerships with other allies, including industry, state and local
              government, and non-profit organizations. A collaboration on first-year
              engineering design with Tohoku University, in Sendai, Japan, has been created
              and  is currently in its third year.  A four-year collaborative project on
              environmental challenges facing  two regions with Sichuan University, in
              Chengdu, China has been launched.  To further catalyze a fundamental
              re-formulation of international education and research, this project is
              supporting two major activities. The first is to help seed the creation of a
              small alliance of institutions, each of which shares the vision of
              strategically coupling undergraduate education reform to the solution of
              complex regional problems. This is particularly important in increasing the
              range of diversity of institutions that are able to participate. The second is
              to disseminate the lessons learned by the core group concerning the pragmatics
              of multinational collaborations that integrate education and research. The
              University of Washington has made a major commitment to the success of this
              project, including faculty release time, staff support and cash, totalling
              approximately 50% of the amount requested from the National Science Foundation.
