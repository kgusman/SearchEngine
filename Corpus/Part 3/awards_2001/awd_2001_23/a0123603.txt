Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic program supports
              research on the synthesis and study of single molecule magnets (SMMs) by
              Professor George Christou of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Florida. These molecules behave macroscopically as magnets at low temperature
              but exhibit quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) which is responsible for
              loss of magnetic behavior at increasing temperature. A series of new SMMs will
              be produced from carboxylic acid derivatives of polynuclear manganese complexes
              as well as from some iron compounds. Supramolecular aggregates of  SMMs will be
              synthesized in order to raise the barrier to QTM and allow them to operate as
              magnets at temperatures higher than a few degrees Kelvin.

The goal of this
              research is to develop molecular magnets which ultimately can operate at
              practical temperatures, analogous to the development of higher-temperature
              superconductors. The results of this research will lead to an enhanced
              understanding of the factors which produce magnetic behavior in these
              molecules, as well as to the factors controlling its loss at higher
              temperatures. The students involved in this multidisciplinary project will
              receive broad training which will prepare them for careers in both industry and
              academia.
