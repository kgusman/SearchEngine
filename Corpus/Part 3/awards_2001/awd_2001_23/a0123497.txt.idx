Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation NSF 01-65 on
              "Ultra-High Capacity Optical Communications and Networking." Advanced data and
              telecom communication systems will require development and integration of
              diverse hardware technologies (e.g. fiber optics, integrated optics,
              electronics, and MEMs) to achieve reliable functionality and to satisfy large
              capacity and high data rate throughput. In the past, the best designs have
              shown great promise in the research lab, but have demonstrated degraded
              response once packaged. Optoelectronic device design is complex and has been
              simplified by de-coupling the electronic design from the optical aspect of
              design. At high data rates, unresolved electrical issues can result in
              significant optical response degradation. In the future both mechanical and
              electrical issues must be linked together in device and package design to offer
              an improved performance of packaged devices with reduced design cycle time and
              cost. Hence, successful development of high data rate systems above 50 Gbps
              will require development of approaches to offer transparent package integration
              in optoelectronic (OE) design. A key issue for high-speed optoelectronic
              design is development of optics-centered electronic design methods. Such
              co-design methods are now possible, given the current knowledge in high-speed
              electronic design. This research seeks to investigate the development of
              "co-design" methods for the design and integration of high speed electronic
              interconnects into device and optoelectronic packages. The impact of this
              research could provide revolutionary package design methods for photonic
              technology that could lead to the development of the first "integrated"
              optoelectronic package design techniques. Two objectives are sought during this
              research period. Objective 1 seeks to investigate the design of high speed
              electrical interconnects with high isolation for optoelectronic devices.
              Objective 2 seeks to investigate the development of co-design approaches for
              transparent optoelectronic package integration.  Focusing on two topics -
              interconnects and packaging, we propose to investigate the use of silicon
              micromachining techniques as a vehicle for combining optical microbench
              packaging technology with high performance interconnect design to form novel
              high speed integrated packages. We will achieve our objectives by working on
              the following research problems: The first is an interconnect study for
              isolated and high-density designs used to package lasers into the silicon
              optical microbench technology. The second is a packaged traveling wave
              electrode study for use in optical modulator applications. The third is
              integration study for heterogeneous packaging of Si microbench technology in
              low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrate boards to provide signal
              transfer between high frequency connectors and the silicon micro-bench. This
              research project will provide important experience and knowledge for training
              the next generation of high frequency engineers in co-design methods for optics
              with high data rate electronic interfaces.
