Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
              science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
              of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at
              the senior academic ranks through the transformation of institutional
              practices, policies, climate and culture. The central administration of UCI is
              committed to diversity and equity and realizes that to maintain and increase
              its competitive edge the problems  contributing to the low representation of
              women in academic science and engineering need to be addressed.  This sense of
              urgency is compounded by the impending growth of the campus as a result of
              'Tidal Wave II'. With the influx of new students comes a rare opportunity to
              hire up to 50 new faculty, which added to the turnover in hiring, results in a
              projection of more than 80 new hires a year for the next decade. UCI intends to
              seize this opportunity to transform UCI into a diverse campus with flexible
              approaches and innovative solutions to problems that affect both science and
              the training of the workforce of the future.  UCI's goals are: to increase
              the recruitment of women into Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology
              (SMET) disciplines, provide a network of support and guidance through to
              tenure, monitor progress by collecting and analyzing data about the objective
              and subjective aspects of equity, promote networking and mentoring activities
              for tenured women to ensure that they develop to their fullest potential,
              including facilitating nominations for awards at the local, national and
              international levels. To accomplish these goals, UCI will appoint a senior
              faculty member as an Equity Advisor in each of the 8 SMET schools, to tailor an
              equity program for that school that meets its particular needs. Their
              involvement in recruiting will include assisting search committees to develop
              diverse candidate pools containing highly qualified women. They will also set
              up a mentoring program for junior faculty based on a successful UCI model. To
              increase awareness among administrators and search committees of the ways in
              which our judgment of individuals is altered by their gender, UCI will make use
              of workshops successfully implemented in the corporate world by one of the
              faculty. To encourage networking among women scientists, UCI will organize a
              series of scientific conferences, focused on different scientific disciplines,
              at which women scientists will be invited to speak about their research. 
              Workshops will allow an exploration of the issues standing in the way of full
              participation of women in academia, and all faculty, students, and postdoctoral
              fellows will be invited to participate. Finally, to provide a tangible
              demonstration of the value of activities that promote gender equity, UCI will
              establish two ADVANCE Chairs, to be awarded to tenured faculty in the sciences
              with both excellent academic credentials as well as demonstrated commitment to
              gender equity. These Chairs will be continued after the period of the grant by
              funds raised from private donations. To evaluate the success of these
              strategies, UCI's annual self-assessment surveys will be complemented by two
              assessments by external evaluators to be conducted in years three and
              five.  This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program.  The overall
              mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the
              scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and
              advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.
