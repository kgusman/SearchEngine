Abstract    :
                   In this proposal, three researchers from the University of California, San
              Diego (UCSD), specializing in the fields of optics, communications, and
              computer networks, are collaborating on the Ultra-High-Capacity Optical
              Communications and Networking initiative. It is felt by many researchers that
              the most efficient and economical way to utilize optical transmission
              technology for large scale networking is to use wavelength division
              multiplexing (WDM) in a circuit switched mode, overlaid with packet switching
              implemented with electronics. While this may indeed be the case, it is
              important to investigate alternative approaches that have great potential. The
              UCSD team has been investigating novel techniques of information transmission
              via optical fiber, where code division multiple access (CDMA) using ultrashort
              laser pulses is employed. Compact, low cost fiber-based ultrashort pulse
              sources are currently being developed, making the technology suitable for
              future practical networks. When an ultrashort pulse is encoded for CDMA, the
              pulse spreads out in time and resembles a noise burst that is transmitted on
              the optical fiber. At the receiving node, a decoder is applied to the received
              signals from multiple users, which matches only the encoding of the desired
              transmitter. The matching signal component is transformed back to an ultrashort
              pulse form that can be detected over the remaining interference from other
              users with nonlinear optical techniques.  A novel high resolution pulse
              synthesis and detection technique for ultrashort pulses developed at UCSD
              enable various data transmission formats to be considered, such as ultrafast
              packet transmission with on/off keying, pulse position modulation, and
              amplitude modulation. The CDMA scheme enables large scale, asynchronous,
              concurrent access to the transmission resources. With a suitable architecture,
              this can be exploited to simplify network control, and increase reliability and
              flexibility.       The objective of this proposal is to conduct basic
              research by investigating theoretically and verifying experimentally data
              modulation schemes for efficient information transmission in conjunction with
              CDMA encoded ultrashort pulses in an optical fiber network. Efficient
              modulation formats will result in aggregate transmission rates exceeding 10's
              of terabits/second, with individual user rates on the order of 1-10
              gigabits/second. The specific objectives of this proposal include modeling of
              the optical CDMA for ultrashort Gaussian pulses, complete statistical analysis
              of the transmitted waveforms, investigation of various optical CDMA codes that
              support thousands of users with minimal interference, bit error rate analysis
              of received optical signals for various modulation schemes, modeling and
              characterization of the distortions induced by the fiber channel, adaptive
              equalization techniques for reducing dispersion and other fiber distortions,
              computer simulations of the modulation schemes, and experimental evaluation of
              the communication system: transmitter, optical channel, and receiver. The
              various phases of the proposed project complement each other. Combined
              together, they provide for in-depth knowledge of the theoretical and
              experimental issues of communicating with CDMA encoded ultrashort pulses. 
              These findings will be shared with the scientific community, enhancing not only
              the knowledge base of other researchers in the field, but also of the students
              conducting the research. We shall demonstrate a prototype optical network with
              several users employing the modulation format that will carry over 10 terabits
              per second of information, when scaled up to the full number of users.       
                  The potential impact of the work will be in the proof that optical CDMA
              encoding of ultrashort pulses is a realizable and desirable alternative to
              WDM. Currently, WDM is the preferred multiplexing method due to its simplicity
              and low cost. While WDM does increase the transmitted bandwidth significantly,
              it still does not fully utilize the available optical bandwidth due to both the
              need for guard bands between channels and the under utilization of channels. In
              contrast, CDMA encoded ultrashort pulses share the entire bandwidth without the
              need for guard bands, leading to efficient utilization of transmission
              resources. Using CDMA can also provide a highly flexible and robust
              infrastructure, upon which packet switching can be overlaid. The CDMA format
              also provides a degree of security, as no data can be extracted without
              knowledge of the codes employed.
