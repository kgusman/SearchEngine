Natural populations of the tall morning glory (Ipomoea
              purpurea) are commonly infected by a fungal pathogen, Coleosporium ipomoeae. 
              This plant has a single gene with two alleles that condition either complete
              resistance or susceptibility to infection.  Both alleles are represented in
              natural populations of the tall morning glory, a pattern found in many wild
              plant species.  This observation contradicts the intuitive prediction that an
              allele providing resistance against a harmful pathogen should approach a
              frequency of one.  Hypotheses proposed to explain the resistance/susceptibility
              allele paradox suggest the net benefit of a resistance allele is mediated by
              inherent costs when the pathogen population is dynamic.  This project will use
              field experiments to explore the potentially conditional benefits of the
              resistance allele in the tall morning glory. 

This work attempts to explain
              how natural selection may act to maintain genetic variation using the
              resistance/susceptibility allele paradox as a case study.  In addition to
              contributing to the resolution of a fundamental issue in evolutionary biology,
              this work may also have applications to crop breeders who have historically
              incorporated resistance alleles from the wild progenitors of crop plants.  As
              many countries become increasingly skeptical of transgenic crops, there is a
              renewed need to understand how natural selection acts on resistance alleles in
              natural populations, both to better utilize current resistant crops and to
              better conserve the natural resource that resistance alleles represent.
