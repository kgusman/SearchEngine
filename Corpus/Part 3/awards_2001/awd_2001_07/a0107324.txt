The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr.
              Paige C. Geiger to work with Dr. Giovanni Cecchi at the University of Florence
              in Firenze, Italy on the role of titin-actin interactions in the development of
              static stiffness in skeletal muscle fibers.

Muscle fiber stiffness has been
              attributed to cross bridge formation.  However, a component of muscle
              stiffness, static stiffness, precedes tension development and is independent of
              myosin and actin interaction.  The physiological significance of this non-cross
              bridge based stiffness is unknown.  The goal of this project is to characterize
              static stiffness in skinned frog muscle fibers and identify structural elements
              of the sarcomere that contribute to static stiffness.  This research experience
              will afford Dr. Geiger with the opportunity to learn all aspects of single
              fiber mechanical measurements using a variety of physiological
              techniques.

The current research focus of Dr. Cecchi's lab concerns
              ultrastructural changes accompanying force generation, analysis of cross bridge
              state during isometric force development and isotonic shortening.
