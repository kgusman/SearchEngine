Abstract    :
                  The investigator and his colleague study computational
aspects of various
              geometric problems in two directions: (1)
Design and implementation of
              efficient algorithms for the
approximation of various convex and nonconvex
              objects in
multidimensional space by polytopes, and research of
              the
computational complexity as well as practical efficiency of
              these
algorithms. (2) Application of high performance computing as a
tool to
              solve or advance toward a solution of open theoretical
problems in convex
              geometry, among them, Kneser's problem
concerning the relationship between
              volumes of intersections or
unions of balls in multidimensional Euclidean
              space and their
mutual distances.  Because of its practical importance in
              many
application areas, the approximation of both convex and
              nonconvex
polytopes by "simpler" polytopes is given special attention,
              and
fully constructive solutions are developed for these cases.
Extensions
              and variants such as approximation under various
metrics, requiring the
              approximating object to enclose or be
contained within the approximated
              object, and finding minimal
enclosing polytopes of a specific type (like
              parallelotopes, for
example), are also considered.  Some of these variants
              find
important applications in mobile computing and
              multidimensional
databases.
     The investigators develop efficient
              computational solutions
for the problem of approximating multidimensional
              bodies by
polytopes (solids formed by flat faces) of a prescribed size.
Such
              approximation is an important tool in many disciplines,
including molecular
              modeling, optimal control, computer-aided
design, and computer visualization. 
              They also investigate the
problem of enclosing and approximating
              multidimensional bodies by
polytopes of a prescribed type, such as "boxes"
              (parallelotopes),
for example.  Solutions to these problems find
              important
applications in the rapidly growing areas of mobile computing
              and
multidimensional databases.  Furthermore, due to their
              simplicity,
polytopes are by far the most widely used form of
              model
representation.  Thus, the work is also important because
              it
facilitates the use of the large body of methods already
available for
              polytopes, provided that the resulting
approximation is good and can be
              performed efficiently.
Development of these algorithms produces tools of
              high
performance computing.  The investigators use these tools in turn
to
              study long-standing geometric problems.
