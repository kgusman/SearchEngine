The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a six month
              postdoctoral research fellowship for Dr. Bruce Knuteson, University of Chicago,
              to work with Dr. Bolek Pietrzyk at the European Organization for Nuclear
              Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.  This project is co-funded by the Math
              and Physical Science Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities.

The Standard Model is a very successful theory of elementary
              particles and their interactions, accurately predicting (or at least
              accommodating) nearly all particle physics measurements to date.  The PI is
              interested in understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking in the
              standard model through the analysis of particle interactions at extremely high
              energies.

Dr. Pietrzyk works on ALEPH, one of four large experiments on the
              Large Electron-Positron (LEP) colliders at CERN.  In the past ten years, the
              ALEPH experiment has made precision tests of the standard model.
