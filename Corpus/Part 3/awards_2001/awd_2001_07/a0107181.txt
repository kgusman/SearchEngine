Abstract    :
              The investigators will determine which physical processes are responsible for
              temporal variations in galactic cosmic radiation with time scales greater than
              22 years, with particular emphasis on periods of order 100 years and greater. A
              subsidiary goal will be to establish limits for the "space weather" that has
              occurred throughout the period 1200-2000 AD. The main effort is to use the
              cosmogenic records of the time variation of the galactic cosmic radiation over
              the period 1200-2000 AD, together with the neutron monitor and satellite
              measurements over the past 50 years, to investigate the physical properties of
              the long term (100 year time scale) modulation. This study comprises several
              components. The investigators will set limits on the changes in beryllium-10
              and carbon-14 due to changes in the geomagnetic cutoff, as a consequence of
              changes in the geomagnetic moment, and its vector direction, 1200-2000 AD, and
              developing a means to correct the data for these effects. They will use the
              known occurrence of very large solar cosmic ray events in the interval
              1561-1994 to investigate the contributions they have made to the beryllium and
              carbon data, and to develop a method to remove such contributions. Using these
              results, they will remove geomagnetic cutoff and solar cosmic ray effects from
              the cosmogenic data, leaving a more accurate representation of the long-term
              modulation of the galactic cosmic rays. This will allow them to deduce what
              temporal changes in the energy spectrum of the galactic cosmic radiation are
              consistent with the observed long-term changes in cosmic ray intensity from
              1200 AD to the present. Synthesizing the work with satellite data from near
              earth and from the far heliosphere, the investigators will set bounds on the
              nature of the mechanisms that produce the long-term modulation of the galactic
              cosmic radiation. They will explore the astrophysical implications of the
              results and establish benchmarks for space weather 1200- 2000.
