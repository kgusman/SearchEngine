     The investigator creates quantitative computational
              tools
for the automated analysis of neural images, including
              software
algorithms to provide automated morphology measurements both
              of
neuron dendrites and of dendritic spines (the primary synaptic
receivers).
               These tools are developed in close collaboration
with the neural imaging
              research programs of two groups, led by
Prof. K. Svoboda at Cold Spring Harbor
              Lab. and by Profs. P. Hof
and S. Wearne at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.  In
              preliminary
work, automated algorithms have been developed and
              verified
(against manual measurements) to identify and extract
morphological
              measurements of dendritic spine length and density
from 3D images.  This
              project develops algorithms to
  i) provide spine volume measurements, which
              are currently
available only through manually intensive, scanning
              electron
microscopy measurements;
  ii) analyze (two-channel) images
              containing two dyes that
fluoresce at different frequencies.  One dye is a
              marker for
spine morphology, the second is a marker for
              specific
functionality.  This allows for direct correlation studies of
form
              and function.  The primary application of these algorithms
is in structural
              genetics work.
  iii) determine higher moment (shape) measures both of
              spines
and dendrite cross sections.  The primary application of
              these
algorithms is in developing models of neural integration behavior
and
              age-related deficits in short-term memory.
     Biological science
              technologies are now capable of producing
data at a rate so fast that only
              with computers and sophisticated
numerical and statistical algorithms can
              biologists analyze these
data.  In the past decade, laser scanning
              fluorescence
microscopy, enabling non-invasive, three dimensional imaging
              of
living neurons, has produced a revolution in neural research.
The wealth
              of information available from a time sequence of three
dimensional neuron
              images is outstripping our current information
processing capacity, which has
              been based upon manual
identification and tracing of structures of interest. 
              Although
it uses the superb recognition capability of human sight,
              manual
measurement is tedious, susceptible to systematic and hard
              to
characterize human biases, restricted to measurements involving
only
              length and counting, and effective only for small data sets.
The purpose of
              this project is to develop computer based tools
for the automated analysis of
              neuron images, eliminating manual
analysis.  The resultant computer tools will
              make practical such
studies as
  i) the relationship between neuron structure
              and age-related
deficits in memory as well as some forms of mental
              retardation;
  ii) where in neurons certain proteins concentrate and
              how
their presence and concentration correlates to the signal
processing role
              of neurons;
  iii) large scale screening of drug treatments designed
              to
correct genetic- or trauma-induced deficiencies in neuron
structure.
The
              project is supported by the DMS/Computational Mathematics,
DMS/Applied
              Mathematics, and IBN/Computational Neuroscience
programs and by the MPS/Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities.
