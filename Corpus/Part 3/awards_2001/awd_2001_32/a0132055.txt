Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will develop  a
              neutral, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam source for application to the
              high rate growth of III-V nitride semi-conducting materials over large areas.
              The proposed source is based on proprietary MID-JET  technology. This
              technology employs an electrode-less discharge contained by vortex flow, rather
              than a dielectric tube commonly used in traditional sources.  MIDJET technology
              utilizing a temperature of 5000 C to produce1021  nitrogen atoms has been
              demonstrated. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that generated by
              currently available sources. It is particularly applicable to Metal Organic
              Chemical Vapor Deposition  (MOCVD) systems, where it will allow both high
              growth rate and the elimination of the use of ammonia.  The MIDJET will be
              adapted for use in a MOCVD reactor and a demonstration made of the system's
              ability to grow gallium nitride at a rate of at least 10 microns per hour. 
  
                This project will develop a charge-free, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam
              for the growth of III-V nitride materials which can replace existing
              plasma-based tools. With higher growth rates of high quality material over
              larger areas, systems based on the MIDJET will have with application to the
              fabrication of high power/high temperature semiconductor devices and blue
              illumination sources (including those for flat panel displays).
