Dr. Seljak of Princeton University will develop a
              comprehensive theoretical framework to analyze, understand, and connect the
              many facets of weak gravitational lensing and its significance to cosmology. 
              The phenomenon of weak gravitational lensing occurs when matter along the line
              of sight, which might otherwise be unobservable,  magnifies and distorts the
              images of background galaxies.  Dr. Seljak will make progress in this area of
              research by comparing his theoretical predictions to actual observations. He
              will make use of several observational surveys, including the Sloan Digital Sky
              Survey and the Deep Lens Survey. He will use these data to put constraints on
              the masses of neutrinos, the nature of the newly discovered dark energy, the
              presence of dark matter in clusters of galaxies, the effect of dark matter on
              the formation of galaxies, and the relationship between the clustering of dark
              matter and that of galaxies.

As part of his educational mission, Dr. Seljak
              will work on developing an undergraduate course in computational physics at
              Princeton, using his research as examples. He will also integrate undergraduate
              students from all levels into his research group. Dr. Seljak will also
              participate in a local outreach program through which he will partner with a
              local teacher and participate in regular class visits.
