Abstract    :
              Prior studies have show that when the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is reduced
              significantly in the cortex of the brain, a cascade of effects is observed in
              physiological and molecular systems that underlie learning and memory.  These
              effects include changes in neural firing rates and in the expression of
              non-cholinergic neurotransmitters and synaptic proteins.  Thus, two
              possibilities are suggested for the neural basis of memory:  that acetylcholine
              alone may be responsible, or that it acts in concert with non-cholinergic
              neurotransmitters and synaptic proteins.  The purpose of these studies is to
              determine whether the mechanisms of learning and memory can be preserved when
              the cascade of effects of non-cholinergic neural systems is prevented after the
              loss of acetylcholine.  Therefore, acetylcholine in the cortex will be
              selectively removed and non-cholinergic neurotransmitters and synaptic proteins
              will be preserved by the application of neurotrophins, a class of brain
              proteins well known for aiding in the maintenance and survival of cortical
              neurons challenged by unfavorable conditions.  Then the capacity of cortical
              neurons to undergo changes like those that take place in learning and memory
              will be determined.  These studies are important for understanding the
              physiological and molecular bases of learning and memory.
