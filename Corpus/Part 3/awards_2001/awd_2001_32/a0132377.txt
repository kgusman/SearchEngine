This grant provides partial funding for a UV laser
              system that will be used in conjunction with two gas-source isotope ratio mass
              spectrometers for measurement of O2 and SF6 analyte gases.  This instrument
              will be one of the primary tools for geochemistry research in the Stable
              Isotope laboratory at the University of Maryland
              (www.geol.umd.edu/~jfarquha/stable_isotope_lab.htm).  The PI, James Farquhar
              has used and developed laser fluorination techniques in a previous position as
              a post doctoral fellowat the Geophysical Laboratory and UCSD.  The PI and his
              colleagues (students and post docs) will apply the UV laser to research
              involving in-situ analyses of isotope ratios involving the four stable isotopes
              of sulfur and the three stable isotopes of oxygen.  The focus of this research
              will be on understanding the application of these isotope systems to topics
              that include atmospheric deposition, isotopic exchange during mineral-mineral
              and mineral-fluid interactions, and the characterization of biological
              signatures in the rock record.  The UV laser system will be coupled to a high
              vacuum extraction line and used in a system that is coupled to mass
              spectrometers capable of both dual inlet and continuous-flow isotope analyses.
              Its addition to the facilities in the Stable Isotope Laboratory provides the
              capabilities for analysis of samples several orders of magnitude smaller than
              by conventional techniques.  These capabilities are important in situations
              where samples are limited and in cases where high spatial resolution is
              required for scientific interpretations.
