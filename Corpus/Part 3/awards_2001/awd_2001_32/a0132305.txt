Abstract    :
              This action is to provide partial support for the First International Conference
              on Scour of Foundations (ICSF-1), to be held 17-20 November 2002 at Texas A&M
              University.

The scouring of bridge foundations during flood conditions is an
              area of major concern to transportation officials.  Poor correlation exists
              between calculated and observed scour depths, primarily because scour
              prediction equations developed under laboratory conditions do not adequately
              account for all the variables found in the field.

Scour is a major problem
              in the United States.  From 1961 to 1991, 1000 bridges collapsed and 600 of
              these collapses were due to scour, and lives were lost.  The scour phenomenon
              is a water-soil interaction phenomenon which needs to be addressed through the
              cooperation of a number of disciplines, including hydraulic engineering,
              geotechnical engineering, hydrology, structural engineering, and construction. 
              This conference will bring these disciplines together and enhance the
              participation of geotechnical engineers in solving this problem.

The
              objectives of this conference are:
1. To present and collect the latest
              international information on scour of foundations.
2. To promote international
              discussion on research and practice of scour of foundations.
3. To organize a
              prediction event to evaluate the precision of scour prediction methods.
4. To
              promote the involvement of geotechnical engineers in the study of scour.

The
              topics to be addressed include: scour of foundations, erosion of soils, scour
              at bridges, dams, offshore platforms, underwater pipelines, prediction of scour
              depth including pier scour, abutment scour, contraction scour, general
              degradation and aggradation, meander migration, countermeasures selection and
              design, monitoring, scour in gravel, sand, silt, clay and rock, laboratory
              measurements of erosion properties, field studies, case histories, failures and
              successes, international guidelines and practices, numerical modeling, model
              tests, field inspection, databases.
