Abstract    :
              0132114 Gaillard The objective of this research is to understand the
              mechanisms of arsenic uptake, translocation, distribution and detoxification by
              Brake fern.  The efficiency of arsenic uptake by Brake fern suggests the
              cost-effective use of this plant for the remediation of arsenic contaminated
              soils. This research focuses on elemental interactions of arsenic with calcium
              and phosphorus, plant biochemical responses under arsenic stresses, speciation
              and characterization of arsenic in the plant using analytical, microscopic and
              spectroscopic techniques, and microbe-root-plant-arsenic interactions.  Arsenic
              hyperaccumulation characteristics in Brake fern growing in soils of different
              arsenic concentrations will be investigated using arsenic spiked soils. The
              impacts of P (increases arsenic availability yet competes with arsenic uptake)
              and Ca (increases plant arsenic uptake and translocation) on arsenic
              accumulation, and biochemical responses of Brake fern to elevated arsenic
              (detoxification) will be examined.  Also, the beneficial effects of mycorrhizal
              fungi for enhancing arsenic accumulation by Brake fern will be explored. This
              is a collaborative research project between the University of Florida (0132089)
              and Northwestern University (0132114).  These two awards were made pursuant to
              the Joint Program on Phytoremediation, 2001-STAR-C1 (EPA, NSF, ONR, SERDP).
