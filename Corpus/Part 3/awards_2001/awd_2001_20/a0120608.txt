              ABSTRACT

OCE-0120610

Boreal and subarctic peatland ecosystems cover only
              about 3-4 % of the earth's land surface (346-500 Mha) yet they store about 1/3
              of the world's soil carbon as incompletely decayed organic matter, or peat.
              Most of these peatlands ( ca. 384 million ha) are found in Russia, the Baltic
              Republics, Fennoscandia, Alaska and Canada.  In terms of the global C cycle,
              peatlands represent a major C pool, yet it is unclear whether they function as
              sources or sinks of atmospheric C, although Gorham's (1991, 1994, 1995)
              estimates that northern peatlands represent a net sink of atmospheric CO2 (76
              Tg C yr -1 ) an a net source of atmospheric CH4 (46 Tg C yr -1 ) remain widely
              cited. Although the central importance of peat microbial populations as
              mediators of both aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, including the production
              of both CO2 and CH4, has long been recognized, little is known about the
              linkages between microbial community structure and C cycling in peat. Recent
              developments in molecular ecological techniques now permit quantitative
              characterization of microbial (Archaeal, eubacterial, and fungal) community
              structure in peat, so that we can begin to link microbial community structure
              to ecosystem function, the overall goal of this proposal. 

In this proposal,
              researchers at Villanova University seek to integrate quantitative
              biogeochemical approaches, quantitative molecular ecological approaches, and
              education and training of students in striving to understand how microbial
              community structure related to carbon cycling at the process level in peatlands
              that appear to be responding to global change on two separate continents.  They
              will collect intact 1-m long peat cores from the discontinuous permafrost areas
              of both continental western Canada and central Siberia, the latter with the
              technical and logistical assistance of colleagues at the Siberian Research
              Institute of Peat. At 10-cm depth intervals in each core, they will
              quantitatively evaluate various aspects of ecosystem function including CO2 and
              CH4 production potentials, activities of process-specific soil enzymes (phenol
              oxidase, chitinase, acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase), concentrations of low
              molecular weight dissolved organic anions (acetate, lactate, proprionate,
              formate, pyruvate, oxalate and tartrate), and bacterial and fungal biomass
              (using muramic acid and ergosterol assays). In addition, they will use total
              peat genomic DNA extractions, PCR amplification, plasmid cloning and sequence
              analysis to identify specific Archaeal, eubacterial and fungal "species" in
              each peat sample. Using this approach, the investigators expect to be able to
              link microbial community structure to peatland ecosystem function in peatland
              regions where permafrost is actively melting, possibly representing a harbinger
              of climate change.
