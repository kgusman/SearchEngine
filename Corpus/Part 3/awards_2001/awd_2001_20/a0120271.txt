Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the operation and the improvement of the
              La Selva field station in Costa Rica, one of three stations in Costa Rica owned
              and operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), a U.S. nonprofit
              consortium of 58 universities and research institutions in the United States,
              Costa Rica, Peru and Australia.  The La Selva station encompasses 1,515
              hectares of classic lowland tropical rain forest in northeastern Costa Rica
              where it adjoins Braulio Carrillo National Park.  This allows the station to
              offer access to protected forests from near sea level within the La Selva
              reserve to the summit of Barva Volcano (2,906 m) within the park.  The
              station's research potential has been noted by the Committee on Research
              Priorities in Tropical Biology of the National Research Council, which has
              recommended La Selva as one of four tropical forest sites in the world where
              ecosystem-level studies should be focused.  In the 48 years since its
              establishment, La Selva has hosted 3,000 research projects, resulting in over
              2,000 scientific publications and 160 theses and dissertations, and a number of
              important books.  In 2000 alone, La Selva hosted 282 researchers and research
              staff working on 118 separate projects, representing over 9,000 person-days. 
              Use of the station for education and training of high school, undergraduate and
              graduate students is as significant as its research use, with nearly 10,000
              person-days distributed among 3,000 students and faculty in 2000.  A major
              focus of the support provided with this award will be provisions and planning
              for modern, high speed computer and communications infrastructure that will
              significantly improve outside access to data acquired and stored at the
              station, and also improve the ability of researchers and students to organize
              and save such data while at the station or in the field.
