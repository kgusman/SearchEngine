This award supports a six-month collaborative research
              project between Professor Michael Bruneau of SUNY, Buffalo, Professor Akira
              Wada of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and Masayoshi Nakashima at Kyoto
              University in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a study of hybrid
              testing at large scale high performance shake table earthquake simulation
              facilities.  The U.S. PI's are developing the world's most versatile next
              generation earthquake engineering research facility designed to provide testing
              capabilities that will revolutionize the fundamental understanding of how large
              structures behave during earthquakes and will feature advanced shake tables. 
              It is a part of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering
              Simulation (NEES).  The NEES collaboratory will include approximately 20
              equipment sites (shake tables, centrifuges, tsunami wave basin, large-scale
              laboratory experimentation systems, and field experimentation and monitoring
              installations) networked together through the high performance Internet. 
              

The scientific objective is to add a new international frontier to the NEES
              project in order to  1) foster international collaboration aimed at exchange of
              experiences by the Japanese counterparts;  2) identify common challenges facing
              the developers of such facilities, inclusion of such experiences in the actual
              design development/integration of the proposed facility at Buffalo and other
              NEES locations; and 3) cultivate collaborative partnerships for future sharing
              of facilities to extend testing capabilities to further the common goals.  The
              project brings together the efforts of laboratories that have complementary
              expertise and research capabilities. Through the exchange of ideas and
              technology, this project will broaden our knowledge base and promote
              international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish
              the results of their collaborations on the NEES web site.
