Abstract    :
              Physics (13)

In this project, the investigator is building an advanced
              physics lab course into an equipment-intensive course where students learn and
              develop hands-on skills in the areas of computer interfacing, modular
              instrumentation, and vacuum techniques while they learn to work
              collaboratively, as they would in a technical job environment.

Recent
              physics education research has shown the success of the collaborative approach
              in teaching introductory physics. This project supports the full-scale
              implementation of teaching and learning advanced experimental techniques in a
              collaborative environment by adapting the ideas developed by P. Heller and M.
              Hollabaugh ("Teaching Problem Solving Through Cooperative Grouping. Part 2:
              Designing Problems and Structuring Groups," Am. J. Phys. 60, 637-644 [1992])
              and applying them to an upper-division laboratory course. Specifically,
              "context-rich" problems are being developed and student groups are being
              managed to foster problem solving skills in the laboratory.

The new advanced
              physics lab course is structured around three experimental problems: detecting
              mechanical chaos, measuring the lifetime of an exotic atom, and designing and
              characterizing a simple, low-energy electron gun. The experiments are adapted
              from F. Moon's book on chaos, _Chaotic and Fractal Dynamics_ (Wiley, 1992, pp.
              451-456); M. Yuly's paper on positronium decay, "Positronium in the
              Undergraduate Laboratory," Am. J. Phys. 67, 880-884 (1999); and the discussion
              of vacuum techniques and electron optics in _Building Scientific Apparatus_, 2d
              edn., by J. Moore, C. Davis, and M. Coplan (Perseus Books, 1991, pp. 75-118 and
              305-344). The problems were chosen because of the instrumentation they involve
              and the skills students can learn from them. By working on the same problem and
              discussing the experimental techniques presented in a closely coordinated
              lecture, students develop both individual skills and the ability to work in a
              group. The collaborative model has been tested with a mechanical chaos
              experiment, with excellent results, particularly in terms of increased student
              readiness for independent research projects.

The project is being evaluated
              by students, both formatively over the course of the project and longitudinally
              as they progress in the major; by faculty, both internally and externally; and
              by presenting for review and comment a detailed instructor's manual, supporting
              Web site, and articles in journals such as the _American Journal of Physics_
              and _The Physics Teacher_.
