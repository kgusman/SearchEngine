              Abstract  Children's Motivational & Adrenocortical Responses to Challenge: 
              Mediators of Child Care Effects on Kindergarten Adjustment  Jacquelyn Mize
              and Gregory S. Pettit  	Intervention and correlational research studies
              provide compelling evidence that high-quality preschool programs have
              beneficial effects on cognitive and language development and school achievement
              for middle-class and at-risk children, and that these effects often persist
              into the elementary grades. Historically, beneficial effects of early childhood
              programs have been explained as the result of enhanced academic learning for
              children attending the programs. However, more recent models focus on
              relationships as the critical contexts, and social-emotional processes as the
              critical mechanisms, through which early childhood environments influence
              children's subsequent academic success. The social-emotional mechanisms through
              which early childcare exerts influence have not been elucidated.  	This
              research examines two social-emotional processes that may account for
              variations in the effects of early childhood programs on children's adjustment
              and achievement in their first year of public school. These social-emotional
              processes are compared with academic achievement as mediators, or explanations,
              of the effects of the early childhood environment on early school adjustment.
              Specifically, it is proposed that: (1) effortful control, particularly in
              challenging situations, as measured by children's behavior and levels of stress
              hormones (e.g., cortisol); and (2) children's motivation and beliefs about
              achievement, account for the effects of teacher-child interactions on early
              school adjustment. Children's regulation and motivational beliefs and behaviors
              are thought to arise, in part, from teacher-child interactions.	 Three cohorts
              of children from diverse family backgrounds (n = 60 in each cohort; middle- to
              low-SES, approximately 38% minority; approximately 50% low income) are being
              followed from the beginning of their experiences in 4-year-old preschool
              classrooms through the end of their first year in public school (kindergarten).
              Participating children are enrolled in preschool classrooms that vary widely in
              quality; these include state-supported pre-kindergarten demonstration projects,
              for profit centers, and federally supported programs for low-income families.
              Teacher effects on effortful control and motivation are assessed through
              observations and questionnaires. Parent effects on effortful control and
              motivation are assessed through questionnaires. In preschool, the quality of
              teacher-child relationships are assessed via teacher report, observations of
              classroom interaction, and the child's reliance on the teacher as a support
              during a challenge task. Children's effortful control is assessed in a series
              of tasks that include the ability to delay gratification; response to
              disappointment; slowing motor activity; suppressing or initiating activity to
              signal; effortful attention; and ability to lower voice. Children's responses
              to failure on a series of puzzles are used to measure motivational beliefs and
              patterns. Children's stress hormone levels will be assessed during daily
              activities in the morning and afternoon (basal levels), and before and after a
              challenging task (reactive levels). Basal and reactive hormone levels are seen
              as indicators of the functioning of the child's hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal
              axis (HPA), which may temper or exacerbate the effects of preschool program
              quality and parenting on effortful control and achievement. Achievement will be
              assessed in fall and spring of the pre-kindergarten year with normed
              school-readiness and language measures. Children's kindergarten adjustment will
              be assessed with teacher ratings and interviews with children. This study will
              answer enduring questions regarding how preschool programs affect children's
              development, and the qualities of programs that contribute to children's
              success in school.  This information will be used in teacher-training and
              program-design to insure that all young children enter school ready to learn.
