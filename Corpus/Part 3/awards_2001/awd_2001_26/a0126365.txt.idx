Abstract    :
               Abstract   Building Capacity for a Research Center on Mediated
              Learning  Mary Martini   	Higher-order thinking skills are important in
              enabling young people to prepare for our rapidly changing society.  The
              proposed project will establish the groundwork at the University of Hawaii for
              a collaborative research center on the role of socially mediated learning in
              the cognitive development of children. The proposed center will facilitate and
              sustain a research program focused on determining how children develop higher
              order thinking and problem-solving abilities and how adults mediate this
              learning in everyday social interactions and cultural and learning activities. 
              The center aims to advance our knowledge in this area by encouraging
              collaborative projects that combine different but potentially complementary
              research approaches-specifically those of ethnographic observation,
              experimental cognitive development research, and developmental neuroscience.
                	Two models of such integrative work are: 1) to initially study learning
              and teaching processes in their natural contexts in homes, classrooms, lessons,
              playing fields, etc.,  using observational and ethnographic methods, and then
              to evaluate hypotheses about the processes operating in those settings using
              experimental research designs; and 2) to initially study cognitive and learning
              processes in laboratory settings, and then seek to deepen our understanding of
              how those processes take shape through more naturalistic, observational
              research.  A major goal of the planning year will be to examine the potential
              applicability of these two models, as well as of other possible models, to the
              study of children's socially mediated learning.  	Center research will focus
              on the effects of adult (and peer) guidance on cognitive and neuro-cognitive
              processing.  Some research questions will be: How do children take on the
              problem solving strategies presented by others?  How do children generalize the
              strategies learning in one domain and context to others?  How do adults mediate
              learning in different settings-at home, in classrooms, in work settings, in
              lessons or sports activities?  Can effective mediation styles used in one
              setting transfer to other settings to enhance learning?                A
              workshop will be held to develop the activities that will be incorporated into
              a center proposal, including: 1) developing a shared knowledge base and set of
              research models among the participating researchers; 2) providing a working
              forum in which participating researchers can develop specific research
              proposals; 3) developing collaborations among University of Hawaii, mainland
              and community researchers; and 4) developing the infrastructure for the
              envisioned research center at the University of Hawaii.
