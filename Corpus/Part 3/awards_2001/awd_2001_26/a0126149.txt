Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to characterize the morphology, ice motion
              velocity and mass balance of Lambert Glacier, Antarctica using state-of-the-art
              remote sensing and GIS techniques.  Lambert Glacier is the largest ice stream
              in the world. Because of its size, it plays a fundamental role in the study of
              glacial dynamics and mass budget in response to present and future climate
              changes.  Along with the bedrock topography and ice thickness data derived from
              airborne radio echo soundings and snow accumulation data compiled from
              ground-based measurements, the dynamic behavior and mass balance of the Lambert
              glacial basin in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment will be
              examined.  Specific objectives are to: (1) Extract two-dimensional ice velocity
              field over the entire Lambert glacial basin using speckle matching and
              differential interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques, and produce a full
              coverage of radar coherence map over the drainage basin. With the ice velocity
              data, calculate the strain rate field from the initiation areas of the ice
              stream onto the Amery Ice Shelf; (2) Derive high-resolution digital elevation
              model (DEM) over the Lambert glacial drainage basin using SAR stereo,
              differential interferometric SAR, and GLAS laser altimetry techniques. Based on
              the DEM, extract ice divides and ice flow directions, delineate the snow
              catchment basin, and calculate the balance deformation velocity and the basal
              shear stress; (3) Interpolate traverse ice thickness data collected by
              Australian and Russian airborne radio echo sounding surveys into a regular
              grid, and derive a regular grid of bedrock topography in combination with the
              DEM; (4) Integrate newly derived ice velocity and ice thickness data as well as
              snow accumulation rate data compiled from previous ground-based measurements
              into a geographic information system (GIS), and calculate the mass flux through
              the ice stream at the grounding lines and net mass balance throughout the
              drainage basin.  With these new measurements and calculations derived from
              advanced remote sensing techniques, we will be able to improve our
              understanding of dynamic behavior and current mass balance status of the
              Lambert glacial basin, gain an insight on the relationship between ice mass
              change and the variation in regional and global climate at decadal scale, and
              provide an evaluation on the issue of whether the Lambert glacier basin is
              subject to surging in the context of future climate change.
