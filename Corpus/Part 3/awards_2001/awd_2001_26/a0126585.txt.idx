              Abstract  Child Temperament and Personality Across Contexts  Mary
              Rothbart  The major objective of this Workshop on Child Temperament and
              Personality Across Contexts and the planning project of which it is a part, is
              to bring together a collaborative network to plan multidisciplinary,
              cross-cultural research on the development of child temperament and
              personality.  Collaborators organized by James Victor of Hampton University and
              Mary Rothbart, University of Oregon, will plan projects enabling the group to
              develop proposals for individual investigator, small collaboration and
              large-scale projects to meet the NSF objective of integrating child development
              research across traditional knowledge domains, cultural contexts, and levels of
              analysis. The workshop has three specific aims.  First, scientists studying
              biological, emotional, social, and behavioral aspects of temperament and
              personality will plan the development of uniform temperament and personality
              measurement scales for children.  These researchers include James Victor and
              Spencer Baker, Hampton University; Mary Rothbart and Gerard Saucier, University
              of Oregon; Michael Posner, Cornell University; and Charles Halverson and
              Valerie Havill, University of Georgia.  Second, child development collaborators
              in the domain of risk identification and prevention who study issues across a
              broad array of contexts (family, child-care, school, community, culture and
              language) will participate in the project.  These include Mark Roosa, Arizona
              State University; Guillermo Bernal, University of Puerto Rico; Wendy Kliewer,
              Lenn Murrelle and Evelyn Reed-Victor, Virginia Commonwealth University; Sandee
              McClowry, New York University; and Lynn Pelco, College of William and Mary. 
              Third, collaborators from both of these domains will address ethnic and
              cultural contexts in temperament and personality research.  Collaborators will
              plan studies that examine how adult informants in different contexts, describe,
              interpret, and accommodate individual differences in child temperament and
              personality. The work will be based on bringing together independently
              developed measures of temperament and personality.  The initial Planning
              Workshop is to be held in Eugene, Oregon, no later than November 15, 2001. 
              This workshop will be an intensive meeting, identifying dimensions to be
              studied across contexts in multidisciplinary collaboration.  During day 1 of
              the workshop, emphasis will be on the common instrument.  Dr. Rothbart will
              present issues relating to the measurement of temperament, including
              computer-administered tasks of temperament dimensions.  Dr. Victor will present
              results from the Hampton Version personality instrument for developing
              appropriate dimensions for a common instrument.  Discussants for this session
              will be three distinguished researchers, Dr. Charles Halverson, for child
              personality from the lexical tradition; Dr. Paul Costa, adult personality; and
              Gerard Saucier, the adult lexical tradition. On Day 2, domain specific groups
              will prepare feedback on development of common measures from the perspective of
              risk and cross-cultural populations, and identify possible across-site
              collaborations.  The afternoon session will focus on the development of
              guidelines for collaboration and the formation of domain work groups.  The
              major outcomes for the second day are a) achieving further refinement of plans
              for development of the common temperament and personality instrument, taking
              risk and cultural context issues into account, and b) the formation of
              collaborative work groups for work to be completed in the second phase of the
              planning grant.  After review and feedback, summaries submitted after this
              meeting will be posted on the planning project website for review and input
              from the collaborative network, and form the basis for future proposals.
