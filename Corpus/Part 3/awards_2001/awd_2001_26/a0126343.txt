Abstract    :
              This award supports a three-year renewal project to complete measurement of
              cosmogenic nuclides in the Siple Dome ice core as part of the West Antarctic
              ice core program. The investigators will continue to measure profiles of
              Beryllium-10  (half-life = 1.5x10 6 years) and Chlorine-36 (half-life = 3.0x10
              5 years) in the entire ice core which spans the time period from the present to
              about 100 kyr. It will be particularly instructive to compare the Antarctic
              record with the detailed Arctic record that was measured by these investigators
              as part of the GISP2 project. This comparison will help separate global from
              local effects at the different drill sites. Cosmogenic radionuclides in polar
              ice cores have been used to study the long-term variations in several important
              geophysical variables, including solar activity, geomagnetic field strength,
              atmospheric circulation, snow accumulation rates, and others. The time series
              of nuclide concentrations resulting from this work will be applied to several
              problem areas: perfecting the ice core chronology, deducing the history of
              solar activity, deducing the history of variations in the geomagnetic field,
              and studying the possible role of solar variations on climate. Comparison of
              Beryllium-10  and Chlorine-36  profiles in different cores will allow us to
              improve the ice core chronology and directly compare ice cores from different
              regions of the globe. Additional comparison with the Carbon-14 record will
              allow correlation of  the ice core paleoenvironment record to other, Carbon-14
              dated, paleoclimate records.
