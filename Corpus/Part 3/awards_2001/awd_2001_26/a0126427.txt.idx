              Abstract  Collaborative Research in the Socialization of Preschoolers' Beliefs
              Across Parent and Peer Relationships  Kelly K. Bost & Brent A.
              McBride  Family relationships are the crucible within which children's social
              competencies are forged and honed, however, the payoff for the child's social
              competence is derived from interactions in the peer group. Children well
              equipped (by virtue of the quality of their family relationships) with
              interaction skills, beliefs about the desirability of social activities, and
              convictions that social initiations will lead to positive outcomes tend to
              become central, accepted members of their peer groups during childhood.
              Furthermore, these children frequently accumulate social power in the peer
              group that can be parlayed into preferential access to the physical and social
              resources available in the group. These facts form the crux of a paradox
              because parent-child relationships tend to emphasize affiliation, coherence,
              and nurturance/protection at the expense of competition, conflict, and
              deception whereas this balance is often reversed in the peer group. The
              question arises: What is learned in the family that prepares children for the
              very different social demands imposed by the peer group during early childhood?
              In this project, we will collect data that can begin to answer this question.
                Investigators from Auburn University and the University of Illinois pool
              their expertise in parent-child and peer relationships for this 4-year
              longitudinal study. A total sample of 100 families (50 at each site) will be
              recruited. Insofar as possible, two-parent families will be recruited (a
              minimum of 50% for the total sample) so that assessments of both mother-child
              and father-child relationships can be obtained. Assessments of sibling
              interactions and relationships will be obtained when possible. Because
              attachment theory proposes the most well articulated characterization of
              parent-child relationships available in the developmental sciences, assessments
              of both child and parent will emphasize the 'secure base' aspects of their
              relationship. Parents will be assessed in terms of their demonstrated ability
              to serve as a secure base for their child and in terms of the availability of a
              'secure base script' in assessments of the adults themselves. Starting in the
              second project year (as the children turn 3.0-3.5 years of age) assessments
              will take place also in their peer groups. A standard battery of social
              competence assessments will be collected and friendship and social dominance
              status also will be ascertained. Between 3.5- 4.0 years of age, the
              availability of secure-base scripts in child-parent narratives will be
              assessed, using tasks developed for this purpose. Both classroom and
              parent-child assessments will continue in the third project year (as the child
              turns 4.0 to 4.5 years of age). Investigators at the Illinois site will place
              an additional emphasis on collecting, decoding and analyzing data with respect
              to the nature and quality of father-child relationships and children's broader
              social networks and supports.
