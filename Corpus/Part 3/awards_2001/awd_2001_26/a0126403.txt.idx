Abstract    :
              FACILITATING EDUCATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH  In 2000, the National
              Science Foundation (NSF) announced a special competition, Biocomplexity in the
              Environment (BE): Integrated Research and Education in Environmental Systems.
              This five-year initiative epitomizes NSF's stated priorities of enhancing the
              integration of work done in research and education.  It requires that all
              research proposals be accompanied by a related educational or outreach
              activity.  However NSF is aware that many scientists have little experience
              with translating or applying their research methods and findings to educational
              settings.  Proposing and designing education projects that are useful,
              meaningful, achievable, and whose outcomes can be assessed for their short- and
              long-term efficacy is a challenging task.  The NRC aims to facilitate the
              integration of research and education by convening a 2-day workshop focused on
              the educational efforts of scientists working in environmental research and
              related disciplines.  Participants will include researchers who have
              successfully integrated education with their research, researchers just
              beginning educational projects, and education professionals with expertise in
              areas such as the life, chemical, and earth sciences; assessment of teaching
              and learning; student research programs; interdisciplinary approaches to
              teaching and learning science; and state and national standards for science. 
              At the workshop Scientist/Educators whose work is exemplary will present their
              approaches, methods, and perspectives.  The sharing of their "stories" will be
              used as the basis for a discussion on how to develop, implement, integrate and
              assess educational components of research projects.  The workshop discussions
              will be summarized and published as a report together with papers submitted by
              participants. The workshop summary report will provide a resource to assist
              scientists who are struggling to integrate education components into their
              research.
