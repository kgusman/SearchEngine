Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
In this project, four science departments (Chemistry,
              Biology, Physics, and Geology) at SUNY Potsdam are using Atomic Force
              Microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (AFM/STM) to continue their
              ongoing efforts to incorporate advanced technologies into laboratory
              experiences for science majors. While examples of atomic imaging techniques in
              new textbooks have enhanced student's visualization of atoms and molecules, the
              lack of an AFM and appropriate related laboratory experiences has limited
              student learning in this area. Bridging the gap between coursework and the
              laboratory, a number of new experiments based on AFM/STM use are being
              developed, some of which are integrated across the curriculum.
	The ability to
              engage students in experiments using AFM/STM is creating possibilities for
              designing innovative courses and is advancing undergraduate research. This
              equipment enables students in chemistry and biology classes to (1) measure the
              forces between molecules, including antigen/antibody interactions (V.W. Jones,
              J.R. Kenseth, M.D. Porter, C.L. Mosher, and E. Henderson, "Microminiaturized
              Immunoassays Using Atomic Force Microscopy and Compositionally Patterned
              Antigen Arrays," Anal. Chem., 1998, 70, 1233-1241), (2) explore phospholipid
              and drug interactions (T.H. Ha, C.H. Kim, J.S. Park, and K. Kim, "Interaction
              of Indolicidin with Model Lipid Bilayer: Quartz Crystal Microbalance and Atomic
              Force Microscopy Study," Langmuir, 2000, 16, 871-875), (3) examine structure of
              polymer films (D. Raghavan, M. VanLandingham, X. Gu, and T. Nguyen,
              "Characterization of Heterogeneous Regions in Polymer Systems Using Tapping
              Mode and Force Mode Atomic Force Microscopy," Langmuir, 2000, 16, 9448-9459),
              (4) observe pitting corrosion and to study the effect of inhibitors on metal
              corrosion, imaging the surface of nanoelectrocatalytic materials used for
              methanol oxidation, (5) examine microporosity and mesoporosity in different
              carbon materials, (6) observe adherence of bacteria to surfaces, (7) examine
              the structure of biological molecules at very high resolution, and (8) study
              the viral infection process. Biology and chemistry students are now able to
              study the actions of DNA binding proteins and ligands, including restriction
              enzyme mapping and gene localization (H.B. Sun, L. Qian, and H. Yokota,
              "Detection of Abasic Sites on Individual DNA Molecules Using Atomic Force
              Microscopy," Anal. Chem., 2001,73, 2229-2232). The data generated through AFM
              analysis of these processes are then compared with those generated through
              traditional methods, and demonstrate the evolution of modern chemistry and
              molecular biology, while providing the students with a glimpse of the future
              direction of the science.
