Abstract    :
              The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) is
              a project funded under the National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research
              Equipment appropriation. The goal of NEES is to provide a national, networked
              simulation resource of 20 or more geographically-distributed, shared use,
              next-generation experimental research equipment sites, with teleobservation and
              teleoperation capabilities, which will transform the environment for earthquake
              engineering research and education through collaborative and integrated
              experimentation, computation, theory, databases, and model-based simulation to
              improve the seismic design and performance of U.S. civil and mechanical
              infrastructure systems.  NEES will be constructed through September 30, 2004,
              and then enter its operational period from October 1, 2004 through September
              30, 2014, during which time it will be operated by a NEES Consortium (to be
              established under this award). This 36-month cooperative agreement with the
              Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE) is to
              conduct the project entitled "George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake
              Engineering Simulation (NEES) Consortium Development."  This award is the
              outcome of the peer review of proposals submitted to program solicitation NSF
              01-56, "George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation
              (NEES): Consortium Development."  The extensive project team is led by CUREE
              and includes individuals from the following organizations: Civil Engineering
              Research Foundation, Cornell University, Earthquake Engineering Research
              Institute, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College,
              Oregon State University, San Jose State University, University of California at
              Berkeley, University of California at San Diego, University of Kansas at
              Lawrence, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, University of Minnesota at the
              Twin Cities, University of Southern California, and University of Texas at
              Austin.  This project team will outreach extensively to the earthquake
              engineering community, NEES System Integration awardee, and NEES equipment site
              awardees to accomplish three major tasks.  First, this project will organize
              and run activities to gain community-generated input and broad consensus for
              the organizational structure and governance of a single community-based and
              community-led NEES Consortium.  These activities must culminate in the
              completion by October 1, 2003, or earlier, of all documents required for NEES
              Consortium establishment and operation and in a proposal submitted to NSF for
              ten-year operation of NEES (FY 2005-FY 2014).  Activities are included during
              the period from October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004 to enable start-up
              operation of NEES by the NEES Consortium.  Second, this project will organize
              activities to facilitate community-generated input and consensus needed by the
              NEES system integration awardee for detailed network design. Third, this
              project will coordinate outreach and training activities for the NEES equipment
              sites as they become operational before September 30, 2004.  To accomplish this
              scope of work, project activities will include national workshops, regional
              workshops, white papers, and working groups with membership from the earthquake
              engineering community.  This project will maintain an interactive web site to
              keep the earthquake engineering community informed of activities and progress. 
              Project activities will be coordinated by an Executive Council.  These tasks,
              critical self-assessment, and project management will be conducted in
              accordance with the awardee's Project Execution Plan.   NEES and this award are
              part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.
