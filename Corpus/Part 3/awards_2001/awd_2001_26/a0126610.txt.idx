Abstract    :
              Abstract  African American and Latina/Latino Adolescents' Perceptions of and
              Responses to Racial Discrimination  William David Wakefield  Student
              achievement typically has been defined as performing well on academic
              coursework and successfully advancing through each grade level until
              graduation.  However, in today's multiethnic, multiracial, culturally diverse
              society, another factor that may influence academic achievement for ethnic
              minority young people is their perceptions of discrimination in U.S. society.
              Discrimination likely influences orientation toward school and subsequently
              academic achievement. This research is grounded in the disciplines of
              adolescent development and social psychology.  Two facets of particular
              interest in this study include better understanding factors influencing
              adolescents' perceptions of discrimination and subsequent thinking about how to
              respond to racial discrimination.    This project has three goals:  (1) to
              develop a clear understanding of how adolescents' understand and think about
              perceived discrimination that they may likely encounter at school and outside
              of school using developed quantitative measures and through development of
              qualitative interviews; (2) to disseminate the results to a national audience
              through peer-reviewed documents and presentations and including undergraduate
              and graduate research assistants in national conference participation,
              presentations, and publications; and (3) to create a viable and sustainable
              research and mentorship program within the Interdisciplinary Program in Child
              Development at California State University, Northridge.  This program will
              mentor and train underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in social
              science research skills and critical thinking through multidisciplinary and
              interdisciplinary approaches to understanding ethnic minority adolescents'
              development using a multi-tiered approach.  This program will ultimately assist
              in preparing future minority child & adolescent development scientists for
              application into M.A. and Ph.D. programs.
