Temperature-depth profiles measured in
              boreholes contain a temporal record of past changes in surface ground
              temperature (SGT) and provide valuable constraints on climatic variations over
              the last few centuries. Although much has been learned in the last two decades
              about the subject "geothermics of climate change" there are important questions
              remaining. What regions of the continents are experiencing transient ground
              warming, and by how much? What are baseline temperatures at the time of the
              industrial revolution prior to the instrumental record of global warming? What
              is the relationship between air and ground temperature over time scales
              appropriate to climate change studies? What is the sensitivity of surface
              ground temperature change to climatic parameters such as solar radiation,
              precipitation, and snow cover? What are the significant factors impacting
              comparisons between geothermal data and meteorological surface air temperature
              (SAT) records? How much heat is being stored in the outer layers of Earth as a
              result of 20th Century warming?
 This project will answer these questions by
              developing methods for and performing analyses in the geothermics of climate
              change. The study entails four interrelated tasks: (1) operation of a real-time
              surface observatory (weather station at a borehole site) to monitor
              meteorologic variables and near-surface temperature; (2) data analysis making
              quantitative estimates of the effects of solar variations, snow, and
              precipitation effects on ground temperatures; (3) repeat temperature logging in
              selected boreholes to isolate transient temperature fields associated with
              climate change; and (4) combined analysis of geothermal and meteorologic data
              to reconstruct climate change at local, regional, and global scales.
