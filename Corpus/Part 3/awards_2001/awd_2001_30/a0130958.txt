Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of synthetic routes for the
              preparation of macrocycles.  Methods to form [9] and [10]paracyclophanes and
              approaches to macrocyclization and macrolactamization will be pursued.  For
              macrolactamization, the reaction of amino groups with thioesters in the
              presence of silver salts will be used and an approach utilizing an azide as
              latent funcionality will be investigated.  The total syntheses of
              hymenocardine, pondaplin and roquefortine C will be carried out to highlight
              the strategic approach.

With this renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Madeleine M.
              Joullie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. 
              Professor Joullie will focus her work on developing strategies for the
              synthesis of unusual classes of natural products including macrocycles of 
              plant origin and alkaloids exhibiting unusual structural features.  The low
              yields of these compounds obtained from plants or other natural sources make
              the development of practical synthetic methods important.  The biological
              properties of the target molecules are of interest to the pharmaceutical
              industry.  The research also provides an excellent setting for the training of
              graduate and post-doctoral students.
