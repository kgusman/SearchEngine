Abstract    :
              Nanoscale magnetic devices are of critical technological importance.  This
              project will advance our understanding of their properties through a
              coordinated program of modeling, analysis, simulation and experiment.  Topics
              to be addressed include (a) development of improved numerical methods for the
              simulation of magnetic materials and devices; (b) exploration of the
              micromagnetic "energy landscape" and the role of noise in thermally activated
              switching; and (c) investigation of specific nanoscale effects such as
              configurational anisotropy and geometrically constrained walls.  Mathematics
              has much to contribute and much to gain.  The study of appropriate limits leads
              to challenging problems of analysis whose solution will shed light on the
              essential physics.  The analysis of noise and switching leads to the study of
              the energy landscape and to physically relevant examples of stochastic partial
              differential equations.  Modeling coordinated with laboratory experiments will
              refine our understanding of the relevant phenomena.  This Focused Research
              Group activity will draw expertise from a multidisciplinary group of
              mathematicians, physicists and computational scientists.  The project includes
              a collaboration with IBM and training of postdoctoral scientists and graduate
              students.   Magnetic storage devices lie at the foundation of modern
              computing.  Their modeling, simulation, analysis and design raise fundamental
              questions of physics and mathematics, many still unanswered.  As device size
              decreases, the relevant science changes: defects, spatial disorder and thermal
              fluctuations become crucial in the nanoscale regime.  Mathematics has much to
              contribute and much to gain.  The study of appropriate limits leads to
              challenging problems of analysis whose solution will shed light on the
              essential physics.  The analysis of noise and switching will be studied in a
              three-pronged approach: by mathematical analysis, numerical modeling and
              experimental investigation.  Modeling coordinated with laboratory experiments
              will refine our understanding of the relevant phenomena.  This Focused Research
              Group activity will draw expertise from a multidisciplinary group of
              mathematicians, physicists and computational scientists.  The project includes
              a collaboration with IBM and training of postdoctoral scientists and graduate
              students.
