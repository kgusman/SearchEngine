Abstract    :
              Haldane's rule is the observation that "when in the F1 offspring of two
              different animals races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the
              heterozygous [heterogametic] sex" (Haldane, 1922).  In the nematode genus
              Caenorhabditis, Haldane's Rule is observed in C. briggsae::C. remanei hybrids. 
              Implementation in this combination is through sexual transformation of haplo-X
              hybrids into females.  Hybrid sexual transformation likely results from
              dysgenic interactions among sex determination genes.  This hypothesis will be
              tested by mapping naturally occurring variants that suppress the hybrid sexual
              transformation phenotype relative to the sex determination genes of C. briggsae
              and C. remanei.  One such variant has been identified in each of these species.
               Mapping of sexual transformation variants will utilize single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms(SNPs) as genetic markers.  The goal of this project is to map
              hybrid sexual transformation variants to the nucleotide.  This will be
              accomplished in two stages.  A resolution of 0.1 mu (0.1% recombination) will
              be achieved by analysis of recombinant chromosomes through a single-worm PCR
              assay. Depending on the genomic region involved, this resolution will
              correspond to between 5,000 to 150,000 bp.  Increased resolution (0.0001 mu)
              will be achieved through a population-based assay designed to detect
              recombination between adjacent SNPs.  This work will further the understanding
              of the evolutionary genetics of species formation.
