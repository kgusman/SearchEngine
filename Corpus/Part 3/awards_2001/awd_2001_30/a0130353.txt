Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation supports the Boston University Conference on
              Language Development to be held at Boston University each November from 2002
              through 2006. The conference is an internationally recognized meeting for
              researchers in the areas of first and second language acquisition,
              bilingualism, language disorders, and literacy development. It is attended by
              400-500 researchers from around the world. Its presentations are chosen by
              anonymous peer review, and its proceedings are published by Cascadilla Press.
              The 2002 keynote speaker is Susan Goldin-Meadow; the 2002 plenary speaker is
              Bonnie Schwartz. Since 1976, the faculty and students of Boston University's
              Applied Linguistics Program have organized and run the conference. Dr. Shanley
              Allen leads this year's team of student and faculty organizers.
