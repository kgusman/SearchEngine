The idea of
              deploying teams of small, inexpensive robotic agents to accomplish various
              sensing, manipulation and communication tasks is one that has gained increasing
              currency over the last few years.  This project will involve three interrelated
              research thrusts that investigate various aspects of this paradigm.  The first
              thrust deals with the problems associated with coordinating the motion of teams
              of robots. Some of the questions that are addressed by this effort include the
              problem of controlling the motion of robots moving in formation and
              coordinating the action of robots engaged in cooperative manipulation of an
              object. The second thrust focuses on the issues associated with combining the
              information obtained from distributed robots to form a coherent model of the
              environment.  The third area of research concerns the problems associated with
              designing and analyzing networking strategies that are appropriate for use with
              distributed teams of robotic agents. Since the platforms are mobile, many of
              the traditional networking strategies, which were designed with fixed
              infrastructure in mind, are not applicable. As part of this proposal we intend
              to investigate questions concerning the appropriateness of various wireless
              networking technologies such as IEEE 802.11b and Bluetooth. This proposal
              requests funding to purchase the equipment required to develop a fleet of
              networked robots that would serve as a shared testbed for our research
              efforts.
