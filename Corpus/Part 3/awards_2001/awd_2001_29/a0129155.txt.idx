Abstract    :
              0129155 Brachfeld  This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Stefanie Brachfeld of Ohio State University and Catherine Kissel and
              Carlo Laj of the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Paris, France.  The
              objective of the research is the construction of a proven, millennial-scale
              correlation and dating tool for Antarctic glacial-marine sediments beyond the
              range of radio-carbon dating.  Researchers will utilize an established
              geomagnetic method of dating sediment cores in which paleointensity records
              from an undated core are correlated with high-resolution paleointensity target
              curves in order to import absolute ages to one's core site. The analyses will
              be conducted on nine late Pleistocene through Holocene kasten cores and jumbo
              piston cores from sites in the East Antarctic land margin.   The construction
              of the paleointensity records requires investigation of the remanence vector
              recorded by the sediments (paleomagnetism) and investigation of the magnetic
              mineral assemblage in the sediments (rock magnetism).  The US investigator is
              an expert in rock magnetic analyses. This is complemented by French expertise
              in paleomagnetism and access to the French lab's high-resolution pass-through
              magnetometer that will be used to measure u-channel samples.   This award
              represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS will support
              the visits of French researchers to the United States.
