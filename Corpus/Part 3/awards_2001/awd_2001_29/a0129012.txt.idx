Abstract    :
              Abstract CTS-0129012 P. Van Tassel, Wayne State University   This proposed
              workshop is conceived as one of the answers to the NSF's "Grand Challenge in
              Nanoscale Science and Engineering". It will assess the recent advances (and
              promise) in the creation and usage of devices and materials of nanometric
              dimensions. It will be hosted as part of the 2001 annual meeting of the
              American Institute of Chemical Engineers in Reno NV, with a goal to maximize
              the exposure of the traditional  engineer attendees  to the new field of
              nanotechnology. To achieve this objective, it is proposed to: 1. Invite six
              leading experts to discuss their views of the  research directions most likely
              to dominate the next ten years. A forum will follow these presentations. 2.
              Encourage the participation of young promising researchers by having each of
              the six experts nominate two of them. In summary, this workshop, and its panel
              discussions, should be an effective device to stimulate collective
              "brainstorms" among a large number of interested participants. It will  also
              provide an incentive for younger scientists' and industrial scientists'
              participation.
