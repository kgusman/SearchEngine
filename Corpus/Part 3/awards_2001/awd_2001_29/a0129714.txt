The
              purpose of this project is to investigate methods for describing certain
              nonlinear integrable systems in terms of collective modes.  A collective-mode
              description uses only a few parameters to describe the important features of a
              system, and the evolution of the system can be well understood in terms of the
              evolution of only these few parameters.  Various nonlinear optical systems of
              current technological interest, such as second harmonic generation, three-wave
              parametric interactions,  stimulated Raman scattering, and two-photon
              propagation, will be studied.  We seek to determine forms of collective modes
              that may be useful for these systems, and then to determine how parameter
              values for these collective modes may be gleaned from input data.  New types of
              collective modes, called virtual solitons, have already been discovered in
              second harmonic generation.

The purpose of this project is to develop new
              ways to express solutions of the complicated equations describing interactions
              of laser light with matter.  Simple mathematical expressions that give exact
              solutions of these equations are known for some simple pulses and certain
              combinations of such pulses.  Some of these pulses are the same type as the
              optical pulses that are used to transmit information in optical fibers.  In
              this project, we will develop ways to express other solutions of the equations
              in a more explicit form than is currently available.  In the process, we will
              find new classes of useful pulse forms and broaden the class of well-understood
              solutions.
