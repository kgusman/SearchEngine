Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to produce soft
              magnetic Fe-Co nanocomposites with end applications in EMI suppression, motors,
              generators, magnetic bearings, magnetic recording heads and many advanced
              electric systems. High performance electronic color image display has become a
              standard feature of many modern commercial products.  These products must use
              timing circuits and operating frequencies from as low as 30 MHz to over 130
              MHz.  Wide bandwidth electromagnetic interference (EMI) noises are inherent to
              these characteristically high frequency architecture systems.  Hence
              development of cost effective and high performance materials are of great
              interest to prevent EMI.  Excellent magnetic properties of nanocrystalline
              Fe-Co can find an important application in EMI prevention devices.  In
              accordance with this development, Materials Modification Inc. (MMI) proposes to
              synthesize and process Fe-Co nanocomposites by the powder metallurgy (P/M)
              route.  MMI has expertise in nanopowder processing techniques that can be
              easily scaled up for production. Upon completion of this Phase I project,
              an
advanced Fe-Co soft magnet with high permeability, large saturation
              magnetization, low energy loss (hysteretic and eddy current), and high
              temperature properties will be developed.  Composition and structure will be
              tailored at the nano-scale to obtain the desired mechanical and magnetic
              properties required for EMI suppression devices. 

The nanocrystalline Fe-Co
              soft magnets can be used in EMI prevention devices, motors and transformers,
              generators, magnetic bearings, data communication interface components,
              magnetic recording heads, sensors, and reactors.  Fe-Co nanocomposite with
              superior magnetic properties, low core-loss, and creep resistance at elevated
              temperatures can be used in integral starter/generation (ISGs) and power units
              (IPUs) in a modern aircraft.
