Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new approach for the fabrication of periodic nanoelectronic device arrays.
              Processing of structures on the sub-100nm scale poses significant challenges
              due to limited resolution of available lithographic methods.  The proposed
              technique will address the deficiencies of the existing nanofabrication
              approaches by directly growing nanostructures inside a molecularly
              self-assembled NanoWell shadow mask, which offers an unprecedented atomic-scale
              control over the nanostructure size.  During the proposed research, a silica
              shadow mask with cylindrical pores ~3-30 nm, or NanoWells, will be
              self-assembled employing organic surfactant molecules. Silicon nanorods will be
              grown inside NanoWells by both CVD and sputtering, followed by chemical removal
              of a shadow mask.  An array of Si nanorod LEDs will be fabricated to
              demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach as well as the quantum
              size effect for the Si nanorods. 

If successful, this cost effective,
              high-throughput, and ultra-high precision technique will figure into a wide
              range of electronic device array applications such as sensors, processors,
              memories and displays, and provide enhanced miniaturization, speed, and power
              reduction.  The proposed technique will offer the dramatically improved
              nanoprocessing capabilities for the fabrication of flat panel displays, sensor
              arrays, quantum dots, nanomagnetics, image and signal processors.  It will have
              a broad range of potential applications in commercial microelectronics and
              image processing industries.
