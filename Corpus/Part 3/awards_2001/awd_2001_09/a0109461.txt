Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a major
              problem faced by participants and government regulators in the electrical power
              industry.  The electric power industry in the United States and throughout much
              of the world is presently in a period of radical and rapid restructuring. The
              ultimate goal of much of this restructuring is lower prices, to be achieved
              through the development of competitive markets for electricity.  These changes
              require new tools both for the market participants and for the market
              regulators. For the participants one such new tool is the ability to optimize
              their market decisions in order to maximize profit.  For the regulators a new
              tool is needed to insure that the market operates without undue market power
              abuses by the participants.  As will be shown in this proposal, the software
              tool needs of both the participants and regulators are quite similar.  The goal
              of this project is the development of such a tool.

PowerWorld Corporation's
              present customers include traditional utilities, power marketers, industry
              consultants, several state regulatory commissions, as well as the Federal
              Energy Regulatory Commission. Many of these customers have expressed a great
              desire for PowerWorld to expand its products to include a detailed market
              simulation tool. PowerWorld Simulator, with further development, has a
              tremendous potential to be one of the most valuable new tools available in the
              coming years.
