Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address bulk
               micromachining of single crystal silicon carbide and III-V nitride
              semiconductors to develop miniaturized fluid density and viscosity sensors
              based on acoustic wave (AW) principles.  Phase I will develop sensors capable
              of precisely measuring fluid viscosity and density over wide limits under harsh
              operating conditions: high pressure, high temperature, corrosive, or abrasive. 
              The harsh environments require fabrication of microelectromechanical systems
              (MEMS) for fluid viscosity-density sensors from silicon carbide (SiC) and
              gallium-aluminum nitride (GaN-AlN) compounds, which have high melting
              temperatures (1700-3000 degrees Centigrade) and favorable chemical and
              mechanical properties.  Phase I will test the feasibility of the micromachined
              SiC-AlN fluid viscosity-density sensors by fabricating an unpackaged
              pre-prototype device from these materials and demonstrate the measurement of
              viscosity and density in a variety of fluids at various temperatures and
              pressures.

Harsh-environment MEMS fluid viscosity and density sensors have
              commercial applications in boreholes for oil exploration and production,
              monitoring of engine fluids in automobiles, aerospace and military vehicles,
              and monitoring chemical synthesis and production processes.  These devices are
              expected to increase oil-well production at reduced cost, promote more
              efficient use of engine fluids resulting from direct and continuous feedback of
              fluid characteristics, and enable real-time in situ monitoring of chemical
              processes.
