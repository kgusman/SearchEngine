Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Are ant-plant mutualisms
              disrupted in rainforest fragments?"  The subtitle is "Influence of fragment
              size and edge proximity on ant colony establishment, growth, and defense
              against herbivores."  This research investigates how rain forest fragmentation
              impacts plants and the ants that defend them from herbivores.  In addition to
              determining if the community of ant-plant mutualists is reduced in fragments, a
              focal ant-plant system is being used to experimentally investigate three
              potential mechanisms by which ant-plant mutualisms can be altered in forest
              fragments.  The field work is being carried out in Brazil.
