Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              printable, soluble conducting polymers that can be crosslinked using ultra
              violet light.  These printable, conducting polymers can be printed using
              photolithography into thin films with 2-dimensional features ranging from solid
              thin films for flexible displays to highly detailed features for printed wiring
              boards and multi chip modules.  These printed conducting polymers will also be
              low-cost, flexible, lightweight and mechanically more robust than inorganic
              electronics.  Soluble, conductive polymers will be synthesized with functional
              groups that can be crosslinked by a polymerization reaction induced by
              ultraviolet light.  Thin films will be cast onto substrates and then rendered
              insoluble by the crosslinking polymerization under ultra violet light.  The
              kinetics of photopolymerization will be measured and optimized to maximize the
              resolution of photoimaging for micron sized conducting features.  An
              engineering analysis will be performed to determine if the process conditions,
              printing resolution and conductivity of our proposed conducting polymers is
              commercially attractive for electronics applications.

Commercial
              applications for printable conducting polymers include flexible displays,
              printed wiring boards, multi chip modules, transistors, and light emitting
              diodes especially when the combination of conductivity and the properties of
              plastics (flexibility, mechanical stability, etc.) are desired.
