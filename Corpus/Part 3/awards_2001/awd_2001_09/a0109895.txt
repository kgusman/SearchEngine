     The goal of the project is to gain a new
              quantitative
insight, on the basis of advanced mathematical methods,
              into
kinetics of biological processes in irradiated cell populations.
The
              investigator formulates and analyzes a comprehensive
mechanistic mathematical
              model of these processes, including
formation of radiation-induced lesions and
              their repair,
misrepair and fixation, cell cycling and cell death. 
              Mathematical
modeling techniques include general age-dependent
              branching
stochastic processes, queueing systems, stochastic simulation,
and
              modern methods of statistical inference.  Parameters of the
model are
              estimated from experimental data on kinetics and
survival of cells in
              synchronized cultures of S3 HeLa and V79
cells exposed to continuous
              irradiation at various dose rates.
Parameter estimation is based on a
              comprehensive stochastic
simulation model of the underlying biological
              processes and on
methods of stochastic optimization in the maximum
              likelihood
setting.  The model is applied to stationary and exponential
              cell
cultures that serve as experimental counterparts of tumor
              cell
populations at different stages of tumor development.  The
distribution
              of the number of surviving clonogenic cells at the
end of radiation exposure,
              obtained from the comprehensive
simulation model of cell population kinetics,
              is compared with
explicit formulas for this distribution within simpler birth
              and
death Markov models that resulted from the preliminary studies.
The most
              important biological outcome of this work consists of
the set of estimates of
              unobservable model parameters, which are
interpretable in biologically
              appealing terms of repair processes
and cell kinetics.  The project has a
              significant impact on
evaluation, prediction and optimization of the efficacy
              of
radiation cancer treatment and associated methods of cure
              rate
estimation.
     A remarkable progress in cell biology and radiation
              biology
since the 1920's has resulted in a prodigious amount of
experimental
              data comprising all aspects of cell responses to
ionizing radiation.  These
              data represent an invaluable source of
information for furthering our
              knowledge about intracellular
processes in normal and irradiated cells. 
              However, to a large
extent, this gold mine of experimental findings amassed
              over
years remains unclaimed.  The investigator and his collaborators
attempt
              to understand and describe mathematically the most basic
processes in normal
              and irradiated cells.  This is accomplished on
the basis of advanced
              mathematical, statistical and computational
methods applied to the original
              experimental data describing
responses of several cell lines to radiation
              exposure at variable
dose rate.  The project was triggered by and has
              far-reaching
implications for cancer radiotherapy.
