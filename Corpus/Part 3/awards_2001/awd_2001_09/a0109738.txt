     There are certain confluences involving graphs in
              physics,
molecular biology, number theory, Teichmueller theory,
              dynamical
systems, fluid dynamics, and 3-manifold invariants, which in
              turn
reflect possibly deeper relations among their theoretical
foundations
              which have yet to be developed.  The investigators
organize a workshop to
              consider mathematical structures with
application to specific problems in
              fields increasingly connected
to mathematics, for example the global geometry
              of macromolecular
folding, including both proteins and RNA.  Recent
              mathematical
results allow for a treatment of the full spatial
              folding
problem: how do the physico-chemical properties of
              macromolecules
determine their spatial folding characteristics? 
              Roughly,
folding can be modeled as a family of weighted arcs, each
              arc
corresponding to a chemical bond, the weight the Boltzmann
strength of
              the bond.  The graphs formed from combining these
weighted ars give a space of
              weghted graphs representing all
possible foldings.  Can an appropriate energy
              functional be found
on such a space to study the gradient flow minimizing the
              total
energy?  Several participants use this approach to understand
dynamic
              folding.  Related spaces of graphs in biology are those of
phylogenetic trees
              formed by speciation.  Though the global
geometry of these spaces is
              understood, the nature of the local
geometry is not known; some of the
              participants study these
questions.  A recent discovery in string theory is
              the exotic
structure of an "operad" associated with spaces of graphs. 
              Some
of the researchers at the workshop investigate these higher
              order
structures, and their possible use in biology.
     Graph theory is a
              branch of mathematics dealing with objects
called graphs.  A graph consists of
              a set of points or vertices
that are connected by links or edges.  An ordinary
              map, for
example, is a graph whose vertices are towns and whose edges
              are
roads.  Although graphs are abstract objects, they have been used
to
              represent a wide variety of real objects or processes.  A
familiar use of
              graphs is to represent the evolutionary
relationships between a group of
              organisms -- family trees.  It is
a testimony to their great versatility and
              usefulness that graphs
have been used in fields as diverse as biology,
              economics, and
computer science.  In the field of biotechnology, there has
              been
an explosion in the use of graphs to represent the complex
physical
              structure of the basic proteins produced by DNA.  This
work has important
              applications in understanding genetic diseases
and in designing medicines to
              cure them.  Because methods based on
graph theory have been developed
              independently in many fields, it
is extremely likely that sharing problems and
              results between
fields will lead to advances.  The purpose of this workshop is
              to
bring together mathematicians and biologists working on problems
involving
              graph theory to describe and discuss their work in an
interdisciplinary
              setting.
