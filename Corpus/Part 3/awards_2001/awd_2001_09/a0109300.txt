Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will identify
              commercially-important genes in Pinctada margaritifera as targets for future
              manipulation in order to improve the efficiency and profitability of black
              pearl farming. This work will also attempt to produce transgenic pearl oysters
              that carry the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) transgene under a constitutive
              eukaryotic promoter.  Transgenic animals expressing the reporter gene will be
              followed to monitor expression patterns of the transgene in a controlled
              quarantine nursery system.  Concurrent experiments will isolate genes involved
              in growth regulation and nacre formation in this species.  Candidate growth
              hormone and nacre protein genes will be sequenced, compared to known genes of
              similar function in other molluscs and verified as homologous 

The
              commercial application of this project will be at the high end of the black
              pearl market that is estimated to be of the order of $ 150 million in the
              Pacific alone.  This project is expected to result in the production of faster
              growing oysters that yield bigger and higher quality pearls than those
              currently available.
