This dissertation project is a study of the relationship
              between law and marriage practices in Khartoum, Sudan, focusing on cases in
              Islamic law which involve the husband's responsibility to provide for his wife
              and her duty to obey him. Through an examination of legal codes, marriage
              contracts and archives, observations of courtroom proceedings and interviews
              with men and women involved in divorce proceedings in two different
              communities, this project will provide answers to two distinct but interrelated
              questions: Is the Islamic law promulgated recently in Sudan substantially
              different from the secular law previously applied there, or is there a
              continuity in modern Sudanese law that distinguishes it from Sudan's'
              pre-colonial Islamic past?  If the law practiced in Sudan today is
              distinctively modern, how has the Islamic legal tradition evolved?  The
              information from this study will contribute to understanding on law, tradition
              and the relationship between religion and the state.  The data to be collected
              will provide information that can be compared with studies of law and marriage
              in other Islamic states, and will address studies of Islamic movements in
              secular states. It will advance our understanding of the transformation of
              traditional into modern societies, will advance the education of a young social
              scientists, and will improve our understanding of this important region of the
              world.
