Abstract    :
              This project brings together two areas of research: intergroup cognition and
              emotion. The goal is to investigate how social perceivers' emotional states
              shape their attitudes of specific social targets in ways outside of their
              awareness and control. Although the past two decades have witnessed new and
              important insights into psychological processes underlying the form and
              function of stereotypes and prejudice, the role of the emotional system in
              shaping these phenomena has only recently been explored systematically. For
              example, research on the interplay between emotion and social cognition has
              revealed that specific emotional states (e.g., anger, sadness, happiness) have
              distinct effects on consciously reported beliefs and attitudes toward social
              groups, but it is silent about whether and how emotions shape nonconscious
              expressions of intergroup perception and behavior. Given that emotions exist to
              promote adaptive responses to important environmental challenges, it seems
              reasonable to expect that they should influence people's ability to appraise
              stimuli quickly and automatically as well as slowly and carefully. Moreover,
              given that membership in social groups, and the benefits and conflicts inherent
              in such affiliations, play a central role in human life, it is expected that
              appraisals of social groups are likely to be influenced by emotional states via
              both automatic and controlled mental processes. This project represents an
              initial attempt to examine the role of discrete emotions in shaping automatic
              and controlled intergroup cognition by examining whether specific negative
              emotions (e.g., anger, sadness) produce different effects on automatic
              intergroup attitudes and, if so, how such attitudes contrast with self-reported
              judgments generated after thoughtful consideration.
