The efficacy of topological methods in
              contemporary applied
mathematics is primarily attributable to the fact that
              topological
features of a system are inherently robust and global. This
              
project focuses on a technology transfer from contemporary ideas 
in
              topology, geometry, and dynamics to bear upon application 
domains which
              include the following:  First, Robotics: tools 
from configuration space
              theory, CAT(0)complexes, and 
computational topology will be directed toward
              specific 
problems in reconfigurable robotics, sensor-based navigation 
of
              mobile agents, and self-assembly systems.  Second, Parabolic 
coupled systems:
              a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids 
will be used to solve parabolic
              variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian
              mechanics, and 
coupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid
              
index will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. 
Third,
              Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology 
will be directed
              toward solving global problems of the dynamics 
and stability of Eulerian
              fluid flows in dimensions higher 
than two.  

In most systems of interest
              in science and engineering, 
multiple cooperative tasks must be globally
              coordinated. 
A common thread is that whether the tasks involve 
macro-scale
              robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, 
or fluid particles, there
              is an abstract space of configurations
lurking behind the physical phenomena.
              Unearthing and 
examining those properties of physically-motivated
              
configuration spaces which capture the global features, the 
topology,
              geometry, and dynamics, holds the promise of 
providing global tools which
              transcend the physical 
instantiation of the system at hand: ostensibly
              different 
systems possess similar topological underpinnings. 
The research
              component of this project is the development 
of contemporary topological and
              global-geometric techniques 
for analyzing the dynamics and coordination of
              systems of 
interest in engineering and computer science. The overall 
goal
              is an effective technology transfer from cutting-edge 
perspectives in
              topology to bear upon systems in application 
domains which include robotics,
              mechanics, and fluid dynamics. 
This is combined with a blend of pedagogical
              service across 
graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, featuring 
a
              focused research group on topological robotics and a 
high-school outreach
              program of expository lectures on the 
relevance and joy of mathematical
              research.
