Abstract    :
              

There is a great demand for technologies that enable neuroscientists and
              clinicians to observe the simultaneous activity of large numbers of neurons in
              the brain.  The monitoring of these groups or "neural ensembles" allows
              researchers to begin to understand the cooperative mechanisms used by neurons
              to encode and process information.  Recent advances in MEMS technology have
              produced small arrays of microelectrodes containing as many as 100 recording
              sites.  "Next generation" neural recording systems must be capable of observing
              100-1000 neurons simultaneously, in a fully-implanted unit.
While integrated
              electronics have been developed for small-scale amplification of the weak
              extracellular neural signals (<100 electrodes), existing circuits have high
              levels of noise and consume too much power to be fully implanted in larger
              quantities.  We propose to develop low-power, low-noise analog and mixed-signal
              VLSI systems allowing fully implantable recording of 100-1000 neurons.
A fully
              implanted multichannel neural recording system must use an RF or inductive-link
              transmitter for transcutaneous telemetry.  We will investigate techniques for
              on-chip data reduction (e.g., spike thresholding, feature detection) to assist
              in spike sorting and reduce the required bandwidth (and hence power) of such a
              transmitter.
The educational component of the proposed work involves the
              improvement of the VLSI curriculum in the PI's department.  This improvement
              will consist of three main thrusts: (1) Development of a laboratory component
              of a course in analog integrated circuit design taught by the PI.  The
              construction of "class chips" will allow students to measure VLSI circuits in
              modern submicron fabrication technologies.  (2) Development of a new advanced
              analog VLSI course.  (3) Enlisting industrial partners to evaluate our VLSI
              curriculum.  In addition to this curriculum development, the PI will also
              mentor a graduate student who will perform research related to the proposal.
