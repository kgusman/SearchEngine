Abstract    :
              Statistical depth functions have become increasingly pursued as a promising tool
              in robust and nonparametric multivariate data analysis and inference. This
              project is to conduct a systematic and thorough study of these functions and
              their applications. The objectives of this project include: 1)to establish
              bases and provide specific guidance for selection of depth functions and their
              induced estimators for practitioners, 2) to introduce depth associated
              practical inference procedures, 3) to deepen and extend existing depth
              applications while pushing depth methodology to new frontiers, 4) to develop
              fast and accurate algorithms and toolkits for the practical computing of depth
              functions and associated procedures, and 5) to incorporate research activities
              into the educational process and to engage the participation of
              underrepresented minorities in the proposed activities. 

Simple
              one-dimensional statistics based on ordering have played such an important role
              in one-dimensional data analysis and their multi-dimensional analogues have
              been sought for years, without completely satisfactory results. The extension
              to higher dimensions of these one-dimensional statistics, such as the median,
              is difficult because there is no natural and unambiguous method of fully
              ordering or ranking multi-dimensional observations. Statistical depth functions
              are proving to be a very promising tool for ordering multi-dimensional
              observations. The main idea of depth functions is to provide from the "deepest"
              point a "center-outward" ordering of multi-dimensional observations.
              Multi-dimensional data ordering is not the only application of depth functions
              though. Depth functions have brought us new perspectives towards
              multidimensional exploratory data analysis and inference, and have been proven
              to have significant applications in disciplines ranging from industrial
              engineering to biomedical sciences. Research in depth theory and methodology,
              however, is still in its preliminary stage and a number of fundamental issues
              are yet to be addressed including: 1) depth functions have been introduced ad
              hoc in many areas, and in great variety, without regards as to whether they
              meet any particular set of criteria and without regard to a general mechanism
              to construct them, 2) a large number of depth induced estimators exist with
              little guidance for choosing among them, an obstacle both, to potential users
              and to those designing software packages, 3) computing depth functions and
              associated procedures is challenging-- without fast and accurate algorithms
              further developments of depth methodology can be hampered, 4) depth-associated
              inference procedures have not been developed in general, and applications of
              depth functions are yet to be further deepened, broadened, and pushed to new
              frontiers: and finally, 5) depth methodology has not been integrated into the
              educational process. The proposal will address all these issues. The project
              will 1) extend the areas of application and methodological advantages of 
              one-dimensional statistical procedures and methods based on ordering to the
              higher-dimensional context, 2) stimulate discovery and understanding within the
              field of depth theory and methodology, 3) advance nonparametric and robust
              multivariate exploratory data analysis built on the depth methodology, 4)
              promote inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning while broadening the
              participation of underrepresented groups, 5) establish a strong research and
              education program in statistics involving researchers in the depth community
              and train undergraduate and graduate students from various disciplines, and 6)
              build for the PI a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions
              to research and education.
