              AST- 0134999
Max Tegmark

Dr. Tegmark is awarded funds at the University of
              Pennsylvania to refine current cosmological models.  These models will make use
              of existing and new data that include observations of the cosmic microwave
              background, galaxy surveys, supernova surveys, and others. With global analysis
              of these data, he expects to be able to address the natures of dark matter and
              dark energy beyond just their current density, the behavior of gravity on large
              scales, the nature of the early universe, and the history of structure
              formation in the universe. 

The PI will also initiate a high-school outreach
              program in the Philadelphia school district.  The PI and graduate students will
              present lectures and demonstrations on cosmology to high-school science
              classes, hoping to recruit students into existing programs that typically reach
              only the affluent suburbs. In addition to his regular course development, the
              PI will also enhance his existing website on cosmology to contain a
              comprehensible introduction to state-of-the-art cosmology research in lay
              terms, intended for the general public.
