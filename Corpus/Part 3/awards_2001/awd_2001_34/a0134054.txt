Arsenic is the only contaminant for which exposure through
              drinking water has been proven to cause cancer in humans.  The US Environmental
              Protection Agency has concluded that the present drinking water limit of 50
              ug/L arsenic is not sufficiently protective and proposes a new limit of 10
              ug/L.  In most cases, the arsenic originates in the geologic materials of the
              aquifer.  While correlations with bedrock types have been made, the factors
              that affect arsenic concentrations and speciation in drinking water are poorly
              understood.  As(III), the reduced inorganic form, is more mobile and more toxic
              than As(V), thus speciation affects both the concentration and the health
              implications of arsenic exposure.   

Microorganisms probably affect As
              concentrations in groundwater, but the magnitude and nature of their
              participation in the arsenic cycle have not yet been clarified. Microorganisms
              can affect the chemistry of arsenic compounds in a number of ways.  Laboratory
              and field studies as proposed in this program will build on the PI's
              preliminary data that indicate the presence of arsenate reducing microorganisms
              in well water to determine how microbial activities affect soluble arsenic
              concentrations.  This information will be used to create a conceptual model of
              the processes that affect As in groundwater.  Molecular probes will be
              developed to determine the importance of the isolated arsenate-degrading
              microorganisms in situ.  

Existing geological data and field data gathered
              by high school and undergraduate students will be used to assess whether or not
              the model derived from laboratory experiments is supported by field
              observations.  Since the project requires an interdisciplinary approach, links
              with microbial ecologists and environmental microbiologists will be
              strengthened to support the investigator's research goals.  The research
              results will form the basis of new modules in two undergraduate environmental
              engineering courses.  An outreach program for high school students will also
              contribute to the collection of field data.
