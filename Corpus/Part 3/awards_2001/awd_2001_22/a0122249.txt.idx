Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. Andrew L. Mack at the Wildlife Conservation
              Society (WCS) for upgrading infrastructure of the Crater Mountain Biological
              Research Station (CMBRS).  The stations is located in Papua New Guinea (PNG),
              the young democracy occupying the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, the
              world's second largest island after Greenland.  The island is home to over 5%
              of Earth's biodiversity and is one of three remaining tropical rainforest
              wilderness areas on our planet.  Despite the unique biota PNG is one of the
              least-studied and poorest-known major ecoregions.  The CMBRS and the WCS
              programs undertaken there are dedicated to furthering our knowledge of this
              critically important ecoregion and providing outstanding education
              opportunities for biology students in a pristine rainforest wilderness.  CMBRS
              has been the premier rainforest research destination in PNG for over a decade--
              nearly 100 researchers have worked here resulting in over 50
              publications.  Despite substantial efforts by WCS to maintain the station,
              the degradation from the tropical climate and twenty feet of annual rainfall is
              taking its toll on the station.  It has become necessary to rebuild the station
              and upgrade its facilities to meet the increasing demands of visiting
              scientists and students.  A new facility constructed of welded steel and vinyl
              siding will replace the present all-wood structure.  This new facility will
              have an expected lifespan of over forty years.  The materials will be
              pre-fabricated in PNG by a company that supplies mining camps and delivered to
              the remote CMBRS site by helicopter.  The grant will also upgrade the current
              solar-powered electrical service and enable improved, modern computing
              facilities in this remote field site.    The station is in the heart of PNG's
              second largest (260,000 hectares) and one of the most successful conservation
              areas.  CMBRS provides scientific guidance for the conservation project,
              providing data for viable management planning.  The station also serves as a
              unique educational facility; enabling university students from the US and other
              nations access to pristine tropical forests and its diverse and endemic biota. 
              Student training programs at CMBRS immerse US undergraduate students in an
              intensive research-training program where they focus on biological field
              studies and natural history for at least three months.  The station and WCS
              also oversee a wide range of training programs for PNG nationals who otherwise
              have little access to field-based research in the nation's rainforests.  The
              education and research programs at CMBRS have significantly improved our
              knowledge of this unique ecosystem and promise to have even greater impact
              after the infrastructure improvements allow more work to be accomplished
              there.
