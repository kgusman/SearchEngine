Abstract    :
              AST 0122449 Inst : Johns Hopkins University  PI: Szalay, Alexander   Under
              this award, a broad collaboration led by Johns Hopkins University will
              establish the framework and foundation for the National Virtual Observatory
              (NVO).  Establishing the framework for the NVO is the first step towards a
              system that can provide seamless integration of data-intensive resources in
              astronomy.  When fully implemented, the NVO will serve as an engine of
              discovery for astronomy.  Large scale surveys of the sky from space and the
              ground are being initiated at wavelengths from radio to x-ray, generating vast
              amounts of high quality, irreplaceable data.  The potential for scientific
              discovery afforded by these new surveys is enormous.  Entirely new and
              unexpected scientific results of major significance will emerge from the
              combined use of the resulting datasets, science that would not be possible from
              such sets used singly.  Their large size and complexity require tools and
              structures to discover the complex phenomena encoded within them.    The NVO
              framework will be built by coordinating the diverse efforts already in
              existence and provide a focus for the development of capabilities that do not
              yet exist.  The NVO will act as an enabling and coordinating entity to foster
              the development of further tools, protocols, and collaborations necessary to
              realize the full scientific potential of large astronomical datasets in the
              coming decade.  The components of the NVO include not only the archives, but
              also metadata standards, a standardized data access layer, query and computing
              services, and data mining applications.  The new capabilities of the NVO will
              be essential to realize the full value of the tera/petabyte datasets that are
              in hand or soon to be created.  Rapid querying of multiple large-scale
              catalogs, establishment of statistical correlations, discovery of new data
              patterns and temporal variations, and confrontation with sophisticated
              numerical simulations are all avenues for new science that will be made
              possible through the NVO.  Future surveys will have well defined templates
              available to enable them to publish their data more easily.  The NVO, through
              its rich content and special portals designed for students, teachers and the
              public, will have major impact on a wide range of science education and public
              outreach projects.  The goal of the NVO is international in scope and the
              project will coordinate its development activities with the international
              community, to assure that the end result is a Global Virtual Observatory.
