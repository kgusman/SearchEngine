Abstract    :
              The investigators will design and develop a computer-based radar simulator that
              includes the transmitter, ionospheric scattering, and receiver system.  The
              simulator provides a framework by which experimenters can optimally configure a
              radar system for particular ionospheric conditions.  There is a long-standing
              need in the space science radar community for more well-trained students and
              scientific radar users.  The Advanced Radar System addresses both of those
              needs.  If successful, it can be used in a classroom setting in which students
              can interactively modify different parts of the system and examine the
              resulting effect on the received radar signal.  This is an excellent means for
              training the next generation of radar experts.  For radar users, the Advance
              Radar System provides a means to configure a radar-operating mode in a virtual
              fashion prior to the actual experiment.  This will enable the experimenter to
              modify the operating mode to gain the optimal results from the observations. 
              Finally, the proposed system may eventually replace outdated hardware and
              software at existing and planned radar systems.  The versatility of the digital
              approach to signal analysis will be demonstrated by configuring the simulator
              to reproduce the functions of a simple AM radio.
