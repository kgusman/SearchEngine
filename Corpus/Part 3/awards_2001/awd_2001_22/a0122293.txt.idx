Abstract    :
              Proposal 122293 U of Ill Urbana-Champaign PI: Bresler, Yoram  In spite of
              the focus in recent years on lossy compression of audio, images, and video,
              lossless data compression remains crucial in applications such as text files,
              facsimiles, software executables, and medical imaging. Universal source coding
              algorithms, which deal with sources whose statistics are unknown, are of
              particular importance.  Universal coding methods are designed for universal
              performance over a broad class of possible sources. In these methods the source
              parameters are estimated, either implicitly or explicitly, and the sequence
              itself is encoded accordingly. Therefore the coding length for universal
              methods is g eater than the entropy; the extra coding length, called the
              redundancy satisfies a fundamental lower bound by Rissanen.   The focus of
              research in universal data compression has been on reducing redundancies. In
              this sense, context tree weighting (CTW) has achieved the ultimate goal for the
              important class of tree sources, because it has essentially achieved Rissanen
              's bound. However, in addition to low redundancies, a universal coding method
              must be computationally fast, and consume little memory. Neither of the two
              leading methods, CTW or PPM, a compression method that has been fine-tuned by
              various heuristics for practical use, are particularly strong performers in
              these respects.  Therefore, the main goal of the proposed research is to
              develop algorithms featuring fast computation and low memory use, while
              providing compression near Rissanen 's bound.   Like some of the most
              efficient high-performance universal compression algorithms to-date, the
              proposed approach is based on the Burrows Wheeler transform (BWT). The BWT is
              an invertible transform whose output contains segments in which symbols are
              approximately independent identically distributed. Owing to this similarity to
              piecewise i.i.d. (PIID), compressing the BWT output using PIID methods yields
              good compression results. However, such methods cannot achieve universal
              coding redundancies close to Rissanen 's bound because they require (whether
              implicitly or Explicitly) extra bits to encode the positions of transitions
              between segments in the BWT output.  Recognizing this hidden overhead, this
              project proposes to take a fresh look at BWT based-methods and the relationship
              to the fundamental redundancy bounds. The project will explore ways to close
              the gap between traditional BWT-based methods and Rissanen 's bound while
              retaining the computational efficiency of the BWT. A particular challenge will
              be to apply this approach to lossless image compression.   The resulting
              algorithms will have linear complexity, and be better than any current
              algorithm with comparable asymptotic compression performance, in terms of
              computation and/or memory use. Some versions of these algorithms will also have
              simple structure, admitting fast hardware implementations. Furthermore, this
              research will reveal the role of context modeling in universal lossless image
              compression. Since near-Rissanen redundancies with linear complexity are hard
              to beat, we expect a shift in the universal coding literature from compression
              improvement to implementation and practicality.
