Abstract    :
              0122863  Kilduff  The objective of this research is to obtain a fundamental
              understanding of two kinds of adsorption-desorption hysteresis.  These include
              thermodynamically irreversible sorption, in which adsorption and desorption
              follow different microscopic pathways, and hysteresis due to abiotic
              surface-catalyzed chemical transformation of the adsorbate where the products
              remain irretrievably bound to the solid.  This research will focus on the
              principle thermodynamic sorbents of organic compounds in natural settings:
              macromolecular organic carbon (humic substances) and micrographitic OC (black
              carbon).  Sorption experiments will be performed on well-characterized model
              sorbents, whose behavior can be better related to mechanism than whole natural
              geosorbents. Adsorption and desorption data will be used to compute an
              irreversibility index to quantify irreversible sorption hysteresis. 
              Non-reactive test compounds will be trichloromethane, trichloroethene, benzene,
              and naphthalene, and the reactive test compounds will be phenol, catechol, and
              pyrogallol.  An understanding of hysteresis is crucial to modeling a chemical's
              fate, defining soil or sediment quality criteria, developing remediation
              technologies, and setting standards for acceptable levels of contamination
              after remediation.   This is a collaborative research grant between Connecticut
              Agricultural Experiment Station (BES-0122761) and Rensselaer Polytechnic
              Institute (BES-0122863).  ***
