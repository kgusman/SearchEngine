Abstract    :
              Improvements in Facilities and Equipment at Mpala Research Centre, Kenya Daniel
              I.Rubenstein, P.I.  The goal of the project is to enhance the quality of
              ecological research in the arid lands of East Africa by improving the physical
              infrastructure and the research capabilities of the Mpala Research Centre.  The
              Centre, whose purpose is to advance research in the environmental, biological,
              and conservation sciences, lies at the heart of the Laikipia ecosystem, a
              diverse savanna maintaining prodigious wildlife populations, much of it not
              formally protected in National Parks or Reserves.  This landscape is prone to
              severe environmental fluctuations that produce periodic droughts and floods
              which challenges the ability of indigenous peoples, commercial ranchers and the
              wildlife itself to survive. It is part of the Centre's mission to shape
              research programs that will provide scientific insights that help maintain the
              ecosystem while enhancing the quality of life of the people utilizing the
              ecosystem's resources.  Fulfilling this mission requires melding
              institutionally driven mission-motivated research with applications emerging
              from fundamental research projects initiated by individual investigators. 
              Improving the ability of scientists from all over the world, but mostly those
              from the US whose research is already supported by the National Science
              Foundation, to carry out these different types of research requires that the
              Centre enhance and enlarge its physical plant and provide additional common
              research support facilities.   In particular the Centre will improve its:  1)
              electrical system to provide uninterrupted electricity to run laboratory
              equipment and computers essential for data recording and analysis; 2)  research
              space so that the large and integrated projects have adequate space for the
              teams to function coherently; 3) housing stock to accommodate the Resident
              Scientist who serves as the local research coordinator and the newly hired
              Geographical Information System specialist who will provide support for the
              analysis of spatial problems so important for the understanding of climate
              patterns and wildlife as well as  livestock movements and population dynamics;
              4)  monitoring equipment both on the ground and in the air to provide the
              long-term data bases so essential for forecasting changes in environmental
              conditions, wildlife numbers and livestock levels so that rational and
              sustainable programs of management and conservation can be formulated; and 5) 
              stock of shared and communal research, communication and computer equipment
              along with 4 x 4 vehicles for traveling over the rugged terrain.   Research
              at Mpala Research Centre is intended to advance an informed and integrated
              approach to natural resource management and conservation within the Laikipia
              savanna ecosystem.  In doing so the research provides the scientific background
              that is used by commercial ranches and the group ranches composed of indigenous
              peoples to better manage their lands, stock and wildlife in economically and
              ecologically sensible ways.  Policies based on research are helping ensure that
              wildlife helps 'pay' for its protection by means of sustainable regimes of
              culling and consumption on some lands and ecotourism enterprises on others.  In
              addition, outreach to these various communities on how to live with predators
              and wildlife competitors is helping maintain the dynamics of this harsh
              ecosystem.  Courses taught with 'hands on' projects to wildlife professionals
              from governmental and non-governmental organization as well as student groups
              from Kenyan and international Universities are common and are helping transform
              the minds of the next generation of environmental leaders along with those who
              are making critical decisions today.
