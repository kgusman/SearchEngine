Abstract    :
              Abstract - 0122242	  A grant has been awarded to Dr. David Hartnett at Kansas
              State University to construct a duplex-unit housing facility at the Konza
              Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in Kansas to expand housing accommodations
              for visiting research scientists and students.  KPBS is a 8,600 acre tallgrass
              prairie preserve and research station managed by Kansas State University for
              basic biological research, long-term ecological research on grassland
              ecosystems, science education, and conservation.  The station has become
              recognized internationally as the premier grasslands research station in the
              United States and has attracted scores of researchers and students from
              institutions throughout the U.S. and several foreign countries.  The
              construction of this additional  facility will meet the increasing needs for
              accommodating visiting scientists and will enhance the research capacity and
              support facilities at the station.  	A 1,750 square-foot duplex housing unit
              will be constructed at the KPBS near Manhattan, Kansas.  Each of two
              self-contained living units will contain two multiple-occupancy bedrooms,
              living area, and completely equipped kitchen, laundry, and bath facilities. 
              The building will be constructed at the station headquarters site adjacent to
              the KPBS research laboratories, library and other facilities.  The addition of
              this housing facility will double the lodging capacity at KPBS and will
              complement current dormitory-style accommodations by providing private,
              self-contained housing units suitable for longer-term residency by visiting
              scientists.  	KPBS is a center for important research on global climate
              change, conservation of biodiversity, rangeland management, agriculture, and
              water quality.  The station is conducting research on important global
              environmental issues in grassland ecosystems including exotic species
              invasions, the role of grasslands in global carbon cycling and sequestration,
              and loss of grassland due to regional expansion of woody vegetation.   New
              approaches in remote sensing and other technologies are also being developed to
              address these important research questions.   In addition, KPBS serves as a
              regional center for K-12, university, and adult community education programs in
              ecology focused on both regional and global problems.  Expansion of on-site
              housing accommodations at KPBS will aid in attracting leading scientists to
              help address these issues. This expansion of station facilities and support
              infrastructure at KPBS will significantly enhance these important on-going and
              new research programs and on-site undergraduate and graduate training and
              public education programs.
