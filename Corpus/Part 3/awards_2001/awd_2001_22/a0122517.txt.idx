Abstract    :
              0122517 Williams  The Conifer Microsatellite Workshop at Texas A&M lab is
              part of an effort to transfer pine microsatellite technology to other labs. The
              June 4-7 2001 workshop will train investigators, postdocs and graduate students
              from government, universities and industry. The workshop has the following
              components: lectures, lab and computational training, a seminar series on case
              study applications, a roundtable discussion on direction of ecological and
              evolutionary genomics and a handbook of lab protocols and computational
              resources. As part of the lab training, the participants will test whether
              Pinus taeda microsatellites are useful in other conifer species. Instructional
              quality will be evaluated by the Center of Teaching
              Excellence.  Microsatellites and other sequence-based genomics tools
              facilitate cross-disciplinary research in evolution, ecological genetics and
              functional genomics(EEFG). The emerging EEFG paradigm is powerful for the
              conifer research community because 1) conifers are the oldest extant seed
              plants, thus EEFG research can make significant inferences to land plant
              evolution and 2) conifers have highly duplicated, leviathan genomes in need of
              novel approaches for studying genome organization and function. Nuclear
              microsatellites from conserved parts of the conifer genome is one of the first
              specialized tools to be developed for EEFG research in conifers.
