Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. Thomas W. Steele of the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison to construct a new dormitory at the university's Kemp Natural
              Resources Station, Woodruff, WI. Kemp Station is a multi-disciplinary research
              and teaching facility located in the ecologically diverse Northern Highland
              Region of north central Wisconsin. During the 1990s, Kemp Station experienced a
              substantial increase in scientific and educational activity. In 1997, lodging
              demands began to exceed available space. This unmet demand has grown each year
              so that the Station now turns away some 700 person-nights of lodging requests
              annually. The proposed dormitory will address the lodging shortfall, allowing
              Kemp Station to better fulfill its mission of environmental research,
              instruction and outreach.   Lodging capacity will be expanded via
              construction of a modern, 150-m2 (1,600-ft2), all-season dormitory. The new
              building will consist of 6 3-person suites, bath areas, and large kitchen and
              living area. The dormitory will be connected to the Station's research
              laboratory via a fiber optic cable, providing users with convenient computer
              network and Internet access.   Construction of a new dormitory is fundamental
              to Kemp Station's comprehensive program of research, instruction and outreach.
              The Station's research activities are incredibly diverse. For example, the
              Station has supported microscopic and molecular studies of green algae. This
              work has enhanced our knowledge about the origins, evolution, and early
              diversification of land plants. At the other end of the scale, the Station is
              currently facilitating landscape-level studies examining the exchange of carbon
              dioxide between the atmosphere and temperate forests. This research has already
              expanded our knowledge of biosphere-atmosphere interactions and will ultimately
              improve our understanding of ecological responses to climate change. The
              knowledge gained from these and other scientific endeavors are used directly in
              the Station's instructional and public outreach programs. The Station hosts
              approximately 15 undergraduate courses annually, providing today's students
              with the skills and knowledge necessary to become tomorrow's natural resource
              managers. In addition, the Station's outreach program puts science to work. It
              strives to increase public understanding of current environmental issues and
              promote wise resource stewardship. Thus, expansion of the lodging facilities at
              the Kemp Natural Resources Station will provide the infrastructure necessary to
              advance environmental science and education in northern Wisconsin and
              throughout the Great Lakes Region.
