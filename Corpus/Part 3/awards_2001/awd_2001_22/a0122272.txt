Abstract    :
              The University of California, San Diego, in collaboration with University of
              Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,   is funded by a Cooperative Agreement from the
              Division of Advanced Computational Infrastructure in the amount of  $26,450,500
               to construct a Distributed Terascale Facility (DTF) that will span four
              institutions: 1) San Diego Supercomputer Center, 2)National Center for
              Supercomputing Applications , 3) California Institute of Technology  and 4)
              Argonne National Laboratory .  In partnership with IBM, Intel, Myrinet, Qwest,
              Oracle and SUN, they will construct a DTF based on multiple terascale Linux
              clusters, as well as large-scale storage archives and data management software.
                A 40 gigabit/second optical mesh will interconnect the DTF's components.
              

The DTF hardware will be integrated, using Globus middleware and other
              Computational Grid technologies develop by the Partnerships for Advanced
              Computational Infrastructure (PACI), to create a system with an aggregate of
              11.6 TF of computing capability and 525 TB of disk storage to support terascale
              computing (6.1 TF and 153 TB at NCSA), distributed data management (4.1 TF and
              248 TB at SDSC), remote rendering and visualization (1 TF and 31 TB at
              Argonne), and data-intensive scientific application analysis (0.4 TF and 93 TB
              at Caltech). A unified Operations Center will coordinate management, user
              support, and access. 

The DTF TeraGrid will have broad impact on the
              computational science community and will ultimately benefit society as a whole.
               First, the TeraGrid will advance discovery and promote understanding by making
              available to academic researchers next generation information technologies that
              are an order of magnitude more capable than now generally available.  Second,
              the TeraGrid will empower broad scientific and engineering communities through
              its focus on commodity clusters, common usage models and community codes.  
              Third, experience gained through DTF operation, insights and software from the
              TeraGrid will be packaged in a series of software distributions for community
              use.  This software packaging will extend TeraGrid technologies to the broader
              national community, including Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) and EPSCoR
              Institutions.
