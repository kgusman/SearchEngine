Abstract    :
                  A grant has been awarded to Dr. Robert R. Parmenter and Dr. James R. Gosz at
              the University of New Mexico for a renovation project at the Sevilleta Research
              Field Station, located on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Sevilleta
              National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico.  The Sevilleta Research Field
              Station provides field support to a large number of scientists and students
              studying the ecology, geology, anthropology, and climatology of the Middle Rio
              Grande Valley.  The research and training use of the field station has
              increased dramatically in the 1990's, and demand for laboratory space at the
              field station has outstripped available facilities; in addition, new long-term
              initiatives for collecting and storing dried/preserved samples of soils, plant
              materials, and arthropods, will require expanded laboratory and long-term
              storage space.        With this NSF grant, and with cost share from the
              University of New Mexico, the UNM scientists will implement a three-part plan
              in which they will build a new sample storage building and renovate the
              station's current shop/storage building into laboratory space.  The plan
              includes:  (1)  moving the station's shop operations into a new, shared shop
              facility being constructed by FWS, thereby enhancing shop capabilities and
              creating new lab space, (2) constructing a new storage building for existing
              field equipment and long-term storage of field samples, and (3) renovating the
              old shop/storage building into a sample processing laboratory, complete with
              laboratory benches, casework and increased drying-oven capacities for
              processing soil and vegetation samples.        These improvements will result
              in a net gain of 1,500 square feet of laboratory space, and nearly double the
              station's available storage and shop space.  The net result will be more usable
              work space for visiting researchers and students, and a more efficient use of
              combined building space with FWS.  The improved facilities will allow increases
              in both the quantity and efficiency of research activities in the Middle Rio
              Grande Valley conducted at the Sevilleta Research Field Station, and therefore
              will contribute to a large spectrum of databases on the ecology of this region
              in the American Southwest.
