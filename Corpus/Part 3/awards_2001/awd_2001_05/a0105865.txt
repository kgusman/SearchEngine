This Americas Program award will support Dr. Mark Bulmer and
              Dr. Bruce Campbell, both of the Smithsonian Institution, and Dr. Tracy Gregg of
              SUNY at Buffalo in a research collaboration with Eng. Guido Salas of the
              Universidad Nacional de San Agustin in Arequipa, Peru. The overall objective of
              this study is to improve current knowledge of the emplacement of thick lava
              flows by studying those at Sabancaya volcano in Southern Peru. These flows have
              unique topographic and geochemical signatures. Three tasks are proposed: (1)
              Determine quantitative inferences on the rheology and flow regime of the lava
              flows based on the dimensions, topography, morphology, petrography and
              geochemistry of the flows; (2) Compare the flow properties derived in Task 1 to
              a variety of natural lava flows and laboratory simulations; and (3) Use the
              results gained from Tasks 1 and 2 to determine the extent to which the surface
              structure and roughness of different lava flow surfaces can be used as a
              diagnostic tool in remote sensing for accurate geologic interpretation of
              emplacement styles and lava compositions.

The eruption of large evolved lava
              flows on Earth has never been witnessed, making careful data analyses combined
              with numerical (and possibly physical) modeling the only way to understand
              them. Furthermore, little is known about the magmatic processes that govern the
              generation, ascent and eruption of these viscous flows. For this collaboration,
              the U.S. researchers will contribute archived data sets of satellite and
              airborne visible and near-infrared data of Sabancaya volcano and the
              surrounding region, while the Peruvian side will contribute access to geologic
              samples from 1989 when the first of the most recent eruptions began, and their
              expertise concerning the surrounding region.  The Sabancaya flows will provide
              an important reference point for the geological interpretation of remotely
              sensed data of volcanic terrains.
