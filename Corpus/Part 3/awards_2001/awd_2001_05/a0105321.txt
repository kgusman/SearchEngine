Abstract    :
              0105321  Theis  This grant provides support for a conference entitled "Summer
              2001 Symposium on Sustainability" to be convened by the Center for
              Environmental Management at Clarkson University in June 2001.  The symposium
              will bring together educators, students, researchers and practitioners with a
              common agenda, but different backgrounds in natural and industrial ecology,
              engineering and science, economics, management and social sciences, and
              environmental policy to investigate the basis of sustainability, factors
              asociated with its applicability and the possibility of progressing towards an
              agreement of research and education principles and methodologies that transcend
              traditional disciplinary boundaries.  This symposium will emphasize the
              integration of research and educational approaches to sustainability and,
              therefore, graduate student participation is central to its objectives.  The
              symposium will be organized around four overlapping research areas:  Industrial
              Ecology, Ecological Economics, Ecosystem Health and Environmental Policy with
              the overarching goal to foster further collaboration among individual
              researchers and educators in these areas.  
A major output of the symposium
              will be the publication of principal findings in the peer-reviewed academic
              journals affilitated with the above four areas:  Ecological Economics, Journal
              of Industrial Ecology, Ecosystem Health, and Environmental Engineering and
              Policy.  Additionally, the Center will dedicate a special section of its web
              pages to the conference and proceedings. ***
