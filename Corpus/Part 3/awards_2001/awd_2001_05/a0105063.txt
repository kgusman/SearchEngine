Abstract    :
              In many fire-prone ecosystems of North America, the historical fire regimes have
              been disrupted for decades, resulting in decline and disappearance of unique
              species that reside in them. This study will determine the effects of
              experimental fire regimes on the Big Pine Partridge Pea, Chamaecrista keyensis
              (Fabaceae), a legume herb that only occurs in pine rocklands of the lower
              Florida Keys.  Lower Keys pine rocklands are one of the fire-dependent
              ecosystems in Florida, but their historical fire regime is unclear.

An
              ongoing, larger study funded by the Department of the Interior, includes
              experimental treatments (summer burn, winter burn, and unburned controls) on
              blocks of pine rockland on Big Pine Key.  Within this design are detailed plant
              population studies, including monitoring soil seed bank dynamics.  Preliminary
              results indicate that the winter burn treatment may be the most beneficial for
              maintaining or increasing populations of Big Pine Partridge Pea.  These
              seasonal fire treatments are being repeated to see whether this trend holds. 
              This study will also determine the relationship of Big Pine Partridge Pea
              population dynamics with habitat variables influenced by fire. This research
              will help to identify the historical fire regimes under which the Lower Keys
              pine rocklands and their unique species evolved.  Results will shed light on
              the processes that can lead to local population decline and extinction of a
              rare species.
