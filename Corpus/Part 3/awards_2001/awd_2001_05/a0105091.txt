This research investigates local and landscape-scale controls
              on the abundance of the spring salamander, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus
              (Plethodontidae), in headwater streams throughout the northeastern United
              States.  Spring salamander abundance is negatively related to (1) post-timber
              harvest accumulation of sediment in streams, (2) the presence of predatory
              brook trout, and (3) distance to other streams which are potential immigrant
              sources.  Experiments exploring the combined effects of sediment level and
              brook trout on spring salamander survival are proposed.  These experiments will
              address the hypothesis that post-harvest sediment input reduces the survival of
              larval spring salamanders in streams occupied by brook trout by reducing the
              availability of refuges among the rocks of the streambed. 

Species abundance
              is controlled by factors acting both locally and at the landscape-scale.  Local
              controls include within-population reproduction and survival rates. 
              Landscape-scale controls are a function of dispersal rates among populations.
              Landscape-scale controls have been shown to be critical to species persistence
              in natural systems affected by human activities, but are poorly understood in
              stream systems.  These experiments will elucidate how habitat disturbance
              affects species interactions in headwater streams and will permit the
              assessment of the mitigating influence of among-stream dispersal.  This
              analysis will expand understanding of the basic ecology of stream species, and
              significantly improve the effectiveness of recovery strategies for these
              species following timber harvest.
