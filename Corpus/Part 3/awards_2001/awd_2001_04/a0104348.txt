Dr. Norman is awarded an NSF Astronomy
              and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and
              education at the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory (CTIO) of the National
              Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO), in La Serena, Chile.  She will use the
              Deep Lens Survey (DLS) underway at CTIO to continue her studies of the
              two-point angular correlation function between foreground galaxies and high
              redshift quasi-stellar objects (QSOs).  The DLS will increase ten-fold the
              number of QSOs used in the most recent large scale, homogeneous survey
              completed in her earlier work.  This increase in sample will enable a more
              accurate measure of the amplitude and scale of the correlation function which
              will be used to put limits on cosmological parameters.  The DLS will also
              provide data to search for galaxy distortions or shear in these QSO fields. 
              She will also work with the DLS team to improve the image quality of the MOSAIC
              II camera on the CTIO 4-meter to ensure that any shear signals, if present, can
              be detected.  Dr. Norman will also initiate and participate in a number of
              outreach projects at CTIO and NOAO that will bridge educational initiatives in
              the US and in Chile.  She plans on becoming involved in the CTIO Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates Program, working with a local student group in
              La Serena to provide astronomy activities, with the goal of linking
              professional and amateur astronomers with 4th - 9th grade teachers in local
              communities (Project  ASTRO), and working as a resource within the NOAO
              Research Based Science Education Program.
