The principal investigator proposes to study the
              question
which manifolds admit  Riemannian metrics of positive scalar
and
              Ricci curvature, respectively. Concerning the
first question, previous work of
              the principal
investigator shows that these questions boil down to
computing
              abelian groups which depend only on the
dimension, the fundamental group and
              the first two
Stiefel-Whitney classes of the manifold these metrics
live on. 
              The role these groups play in the 
existence/classification problem for
              positive scalar
curvature metrics is analogous of the role of Wall's
surgery
              obstruction groups in the existence/classification
problem for smooth
              structures.  The principal investigator 
hopes to  gain an
              algebraic/functorial  understanding of 
these groups by studying various maps
              that relate these 
groups with homology/K-theory/connective K-theory of
              
classifying spaces of groups, and with the K-theory of the
associated group
              C*-algebras. Concerning positive Ricci 
curvature, the investigator is
              pursuing a proof of his 
conjecture that the existence of a positive Ricci
              
curvature metric on a spin manifold with vanishing 
first Pontryagin class
              implies the vanishing of its
Witten genus. This invariant arose from
              considerations 
in string theory. Heuristically it is the index of a yet 
to
              be rigorously defined "Dirac operator" on the free 
loop space of this
              manifold. Mike Hopkins has described a 
homotopy theoretic way to define the
              Witten genus of a 
family of such manifolds which  lives in the elliptic
              
cohomology of the parameter space. It is a very interesting 
challenge to
              express the elliptic cohomology and the
family Witten genus in terms of the
              objects that string 
theorists are analysing and thus to give a geometric
              
interpretation of Hopkins construction.


These projects fit in the
              general framework of trying 
to relate the topology of a manifold (qualitative
              
information about its global shape) and its geometry 
(quantitative
              information about its local shape). For
2-dimensional manifolds (like the
              surface of a ball or 
a tire), a nice classification has been known for a long
              
time: Two such surfaces have the same topology (that is, 
they can be
              deformed into each other if we think of
them as being made of thin rubber) if
              and only if they 
have the same number of `holes' (the surface of a ball 
no
              holes, the surface of a tire or a cup has one hole, 
and a pretzel has two
              holes).  Moreover, if a surface has
`positive curvature' in the sense that the
              angle sum in 
each triangle whose edges are geodesics (shortest curves) 
is
              larger than 180 degrees, then this surface has the 
same topology as the
              surface of a ball. It is a major 
goal of modern day mathematics to generalize
              these 
results to higher dimensional manifolds.  For example, 
our universe
              is a manifold of dimension 3, Einstein's 
space-time has dimension 4, and
              manifolds of dimension 10, respectively, 26 play a crucial role in the
              theoretical 
physics of the attempted unification of the four 
fundamental
              forces.
