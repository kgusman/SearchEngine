Dr. Pisano will carry out a program of
              research as an MPS Distinguished Research Postdoctoral Fellow at the Australian
              National Telescope Facility.   His research will focus on the HI properties of
              loose groups of galaxies, in an effort to resolve controversial models for the
              formation of our Milky Way Galaxy and others more distant galaxies.  Most
              galaxies, including our own, reside in groups, although many properties of
              loose groups, such as our own Local Group, are relatively poorly understood. 
              It is not known whether loose groups of galaxies are still assembling, for
              example, or how the environment affects members of these groups.  Some galaxy
              formation models suggest that hundreds of dark matter halos should exist in
              loose groups.   Perhaps the high velocity clouds seen around the Milky Way are
              associated with these dark matter halos and are the gaseous debris associated
              with the formation of the Local Group.  If these theories are correct, then the
              analogs of high velocity clouds and satellite galaxies should exist in other
              loose groups as well.  This research program will test these hypotheses, with
              HI and optical observations of loose groups of galaxies, that will search for
              the presence of high velocity clouds in loose groups and detect low-mass,
              gas-rich galaxies. This research is funded through the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences.
