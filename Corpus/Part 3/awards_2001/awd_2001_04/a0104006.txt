Millson and his collaborators will explore the
              geometric 
properties of configuration spaces of n-gon linkages in 
Lie
              algebras, symmetric spaces, compact Lie groups and 
Euclidean buildings
              beginning with the question of deciding 
when these moduli spaces are nonempty
              (finding the generalized
triangle inequalities). In addition they will study
              the finer 
structure of these moduli spaces. In particular, they will 
study
              commutative and noncommutative Hamiltonian systems of differential equations on
              these spaces and use the quantizations 
of these systems to obtain results
              about the representation 
theory of compact Lie groups and of the Artin groups
              of Lie 
type. Millson and B.Leeb have obtained necessary and sufficient
              conditions for the moduli spaces of n-gon linkages in Lie 
algebras to be
              nonempty generalizing well-known results of 
Klyachko for sl(n,C). Millson,
              M.Kapovich and B.Leeb have 
found necessary and sufficient conditions for the
              moduli 
spaces of n-gon linkages in Euclidean buildings and symmetric 
spaces
              to be nonempty. In some cases, Millson and 
H.Flaschka have constructed
              (commutative) integrable 
Hamiltonian systems on these spaces but the flows
              are 
not periodic. For applications to the representation 
theory of compact
              Lie groups it is critical to find the 
associated "action variables," i.e.
              find Hamiltonians 
with periodic flows which are functions of the original
              Poisson-commuting Hamiltonians. Millson and Toledano-Laredo 
have constructed
              representations of Artin groups of Lie 
type by quantizing certain
              noncommutative Hamiltonian systems. 
They hope to construct the trigonometric
              analogues of their 
quantum systems. The results just mentioned may be found
              at http://www.math.umd.edu/~jjm.
        
Millson's work begins with one of
              the first theorems of 
high-school geometry - the theorem that if two
              triangles 
have the same set of side lengths then they are congruent.  
The
              analogue for quadrilaterals is clearly false: one can 
change a square into a
              rhombus without changing the side
lengths. So one is led to try to parametrize
              the set of 
all planar n-gons with the same side lengths. From there 
one is
              led to a favorite theme of nineteenth century 
mathematics, the study of
              planar linkages (systems of
rods and hinges).  In the nineteenth century such
              a 
study was of immense practical significance - the problem 
was to convert
              linear motion (of a piston rod) to circular 
motion (turn a wheel) by a
              linkage. The problem was
solved by a French naval officer, Peaucellier.  It
              turns 
out that from the modern point of view the nineteenth 
century work is
              insufficiently precise.  Millson and 
Kapovich have corrected the errors and
              written up a proof 
of a result (often attributed to Thurston) that, given
              
any smooth manifold M, there is a planar linkage whose 
configuration space
              is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union 
of a number of copies of M.  This result
              will appear in
the journal "Topology".  The above work on planar linkages
              
led to a study of n-gon linkages in space.  This theory is 
enormously
              richer, connecting with symplectic geometry, 
integrable Hamiltonian systems
              and representation theory.
The analogous theory in spherical and hyperbolic
              three-space 
and their generalizations (compact Lie groups and the 
symmetric
              spaces of their complexifications) appears to 
connect up with some of the
              newest objects in geometry 
and algebra, for example Poisson Lie groups and
              
quantum groups.
