The project consists of three main components:
              geometric 
integration using Lie group methods, numerical 
integration of
              conservative systems, and bifurcation 
theory of relative critical points. 
              The first component 
involves the design of efficient, stable geometric
              
integration schemes on Lie groups and homogeneous 
manifolds.  The primary
              goals are minimization of 
computational costs with accurate capture of key
              features 
and facilitation of the adaptation of existing numerical 
codes to
              geometric schemes.  The second component 
addresses the role of approximate or
              exact preservation 
of conserved quantities or structures in the numerical
              
integration of conservative systems.  Comparisons of the 
symplectic,
              energy, and momentum errors to overall 
algorithm performance, including
              accuracy of capture of 
such key features of the underlying system as
              (relative) 
equilibria and separatrices, will be carried out for a 
variety
              of algorithms, including variational algorithms.  
The third component
              addresses the variational 
characterization of relative equilibria, that is,
              steady 
motions, as critical points of appropriate functionals.  
The notion
              of a relative critical point unifies and 
generalizes the two most widely used
              characterizations; 
this generalization will facilitate the extension of
              
existing bifurcation and stability results to a wide 
range of finite and
              infinite dimensional systems and will 
provide insights into the geometric
              structure of sets of 
relative equilibria.

Specific applications of
              geometric integration methods 
include the Landau--Lifschitz--Ginzburg (LLG)
              equations 
for a micromagnetic field and various mathematical models 
of
              muscular hydrostats.  The LLG equations model systems 
such as read/write
              heads on disk drives, nanocrystralline 
magnets, and magnetohydrodynamic
              materials; efficient, 
accurate numerical algorithms are needed to carry out
              
simulations on the spatial and temporal scales relevant 
to industrial
              applications.  Muscular hydrostats are 
structural components of many
              biological systems, 
including many kinds of worms, reptile and amphibian
              
tongues, and sea anemones; plausible mathematical models 
of these systems
              are needed to test theories of the 
evolution of such systems.  Conservative
              systems arise 
throughout physics and mechanics, playing a crucial role 
in
              both industrial and theoretical research. Numerical 
simulations that respect
              the conservation laws of such 
systems have been shown to be crucial in
              several fields, 
including astrophysics. The bifurcation analyses will be
              
applied to problems in fluid mechanics, elasticity, and 
stellar dynamics.
