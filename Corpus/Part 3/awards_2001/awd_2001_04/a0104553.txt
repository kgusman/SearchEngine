Dr. Keating is awarded an NSF
              Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship out a program of research,
              education, and public outreach at California Institute of Technology.  His
              research program focuses on studies of the polarization of the cosmic microwave
              background radiation.  The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) provides
              a snapshot of the epoch at which radiation and matter decoupled, approximately
              300,000 years after the Big Bang.  The spectrum, spatial anisotropy, and
              polarization of the CMB can constrain theories of cosmological structure
              formation.  He will work to develop and deploy novel polarization-sensitive
              detector systems, such as the Polatron, which is designed to measure CMB
              polarization at arc-minute scales, where the signal is expected to be at a
              maximum.   He also plans a program of education and outreach that will
              introduce students to astronomy through the construction of a small radio
              telescope, which is used as payload in a mock Earth orbiting satellite.  The
              program will bring astronomy education to a low socio-economic region in
              Southern California and will be developed as a model that can be duplicated in
              other schools.
