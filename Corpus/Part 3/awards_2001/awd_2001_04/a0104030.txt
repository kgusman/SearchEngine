We
              attempt to resolve the hyperbolic case of Thurston's
Geometrization Conjecture
              for 3-dimensional manifolds.  Among the
many possible approaches, we choose to
              study the asymptotic
recursive properties of the fundamental group of the
              manifold. We
concentrate on the asymptotic shingling patterns at
              infinity
defined by the group and seek methods for proving that such
patterns
              do or do not satisfy the necessary and sufficient
conformality axiom which we
              introduced in our earlier studies. We
study this problem in three contexts:
              (1) We study closed
3-manifolds with Gromov-hyperbolic group, with emphasis on
              the
examination of concrete examples constructed by our new method
              of
twisted-face-pairings; (2) We study general subdivision
              or
local-replacement rules in the plane, where we have more freedom
in
              constructing examples with special properties; and (3) We
study branched
              coverings of the 2-sphere by the 2-sphere, where
the corresponding problem is
              to some extent already solved by
means of Thurston's combinatorial
              characterization of rational
maps.  It is in the third context that the
              connection with
classical Teich- mueller theory becomes apparent; we are
              seeking
an appropriate version of Teichmueller theory for our setting. In
all
              of these contexts, we use the circle-packing programs of Ken
Stephenson, the
              automatic group programs of Epstein, Holt, and
Rees, and the program SnapPea
              of Jeff Weeks in conjunction with
programs of the proposer and his coworkers
              to construct,
geometrically optimize, and explore the patterns being
              studied.

William P. Thurston has supplied us with a powerful
              conjectural
picture of the spaces of 3-dimensional mathematics,
              the
3-dimensional manifolds. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture is
the most
              important unresolved problem in low dimensional
topology, even if one sets
              aside the case of spherical geometry
where the conjecture implies the famous
              "million dollar" Poincare
Conjecture. Thurston suggests that every 3-manifold
              can be
divided in an intrinsic manner into pieces, each of which is
modelled
              on one of eight natural geometries. Within each piece,
one can apply
              well-understood algebraic and geometric techniques
to derive properties of the
              manifold. This project seeks to
resolve the generic case of the Thurston
              Conjecture, namely the
case of hyperbolic geometry. The technique employed is
              to
maximally unwind the manifold, that is, take its universal cover,
and
              study the asymptotic properties of this cover. The cover can
be studied
              combinatorially almost as a growing cellular organism
as a plant or animal
              might be studied by a cell biologist. The
cover can be studied computationally
              as a cellular automaton
might be studied by a computer scientist. The cover
              can be
studied analytically by methods of discrete dynamical systems
              or
differential equations or conformal mapping.
