     The investigator seeks to improve ultrasound imaging
              in
order for it to be a more effective tool in breast cancer
diagnosis and
              treatment.  He uses modern methods of partial
differential equations and
              microlocal analysis to provide images
of the breast that are artifact-free and
              of a higher resolution
than currently available.  He models propagation and
              scattering of
ultrasonic waves using microlocal analysis and
              geometrical
optics.  In particular, the approach uses the complete waveform
              of
the ultrasound instead of just its phase.  Microlocal analysis
provides a
              clear explanation of artifacts that appear in acoustic
images.  More
              importantly, it provides a means of avoiding and
removing such artifacts.  To
              help in obtaining clear images, the
investigator looks for an arrangement of
              transducers providing
the strongest measurable scattered signal at the surface
              of the
breast.  The optimal configuration is based on a power method
              that
starts with a non-zero arbitrary source and measures the
resulting
              scattered field (caused by a tumor for example) at the
surface.  He models the
              scattering process with a linear
scattering operator based on the wave
              equation.  The scattering
operator maps sources to scattered wave fields,
              whereas the
adjoint scattering operator maps scattered wave fields
              to
sources.  By composing the scattering operator with its adjoint,
he uses
              the power method to find the eigenfunction corresponding
to the largest
              scattered signal.  Novel in the approach is the
ability to couple the power
              method with geometrical optics.  This
provides an analytical tool for
              computing the optimal sources
that can then be implemented computationally in
              a very efficient
way for both modeling and imaging the inversion.
     This
              work aims to provide a new method of imaging the female
breast for use in
              diagnosing and treating of breast cancer.  The
technique is based on
              ultrasound waves, howver it uses much more
information from these waves than
              is currently used.  In
particular, the shape of the waves that bounce off of a
              lesion or
tumor in the breast is analyzed.  The method is tailored to
              avoid
artifacts that can appear in current imaging techniques.  In
addition,
              the method will be fast and feasible to implement.
Because of the reliability
              and clarity of the images, this new
imaging technique should significantly cut
              down on the number of
unnecessary biopsies that are currently carried out in
              the United
States each year.  Because of the speed of the method, it can
              help
to provide a quick diagnosis.  The method also takes advantage
              of
recently developed three dimensional imaging technology.
Ultrasound is a
              tried and safe method of imaging; it involves no
harmful radiation.  The
              method is general enought that it could
concievably have spin-offs into other
              modes of imaging (X-Ray,
MRI, etc.).  Finally, this new method of imaging
              should create
opportunities for new and established companies to
              manufacture
devices that take advantage of it.
