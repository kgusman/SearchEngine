It is well know that some plant species tolerate damage by
              herbivores more than others, but information about how natural selection acts
              to change the expression of tolerance is scarce.  In this project, the
              investigators use a hybrid willow system to examine the role of tolerance to
              damage as an adaptive response to browsing herbivores. The researchers will
              evaluate traits that confer tolerance to damage, measure the selection gradient
              for those traits in F2 hybrids, determine the sets of trait combinations that
              are generally favored by selection, use six genetic classes of willows to
              investigate the genetic architecture of tolerance and its traits, and determine
              how plant age alters tolerance and its mechanisms. To evaluate these aspects of
              tolerance to damage, plant cuttings propagated from controlled crosses will be
              grown in common gardens, given a treatment of either 50% shoot damage or 0%
              shoot damage, and evaluated for fitness responses and for traits that confer
              fitness.

By measuring the selection gradient for candidate traits of
              tolerance, the researchers will elucidate the role that natural selection can
              play in the evolution of tolerance to damage.  In addition, they will assess
              how past selection has shaped the expression of tolerance traits in each
              parental species.  By determining how tolerance to damage is expressed, they
              can evaluate the influence of epistasis on the evolution of tolerance, as well
              as the presence or absence of additive genetic variance between the two plant
              species. These findings will provide insight into the potential for
              hybridization to enhance the adaptive responses of plants to herbivore
              damage.
