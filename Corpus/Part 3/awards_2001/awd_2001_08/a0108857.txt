     This investigator develops and applies
              mathematical
techniques for the study of activity patterns
              in
conductance-based neuronal network models incorporating features,
such as
              continuous coupling, diffusive interactions, and
heterogeneity in parameter
              values, that have largely been
neglected in previous mathematical work on
              these systems.  Many
of the mathematical results relate to the derivation
              and
subsequent analysis of subsystems of equations capturing dynamics
on
              disparate time scales.  One challenge in this endeavor is that
the additional
              features considered prevent the application of
known methods that could
              otherwise be used to reduce the
subsystem sizes and thereby facilitate
              analysis.  The particular
activity patterns that are investigated are
              sustained, localized
activity of cell populations in the thalamus involved in
              sleep
rhythms and in tracking head direction; wave propagation, block,
and
              reflection in inhomogeneous neuronal media such as branching,
thickening, or
              damaged neurons; and periodic and chaotic
oscillations in a heterogeneous
              population of respiratory
pacemaker cells in the brain stem.  While this work
              is motivated
by particular neuronal systems, it provides new steps
              in
directions with broad relevance.  Thus, the results of this
project yield
              insight into pattern formation and selection
mechanisms that apply in specific
              neuronal contexts but that also
constitute more generally occurring
              phenomena.
     Neuronal networks of the central nervous system can
typically
              display multiple types of rhythmic activity, ranging
from periodic bursts of
              synchronized oscillations to traveling
waves of activity to more disorganized
              patterns.  Many of these
forms of activity appear to be relevant to
              fundamental neuronal
processes.  The overall goal of the investigator is to
              study
mathematically the oscillatory population rhythms and wave
propagation
              arising in certain models of neuronal networks, based
on systems involved in
              such disparate tasks as navigation,
respiration, and the generation of sleep
              rhythms.  This work
elucidates the mechanisms that allow these networks to
              support,
and to modulate between, distinct activity patterns.  These
results
              lead to conclusions about the roles of various
biophysical parameters in
              shaping network dynamics, with
individual contributions teased apart in a way
              that may be quite
difficult to achieve with a purely experimental approach. 
              Such
findings can then serve as guideposts for future biological
              and
computational experiments.
