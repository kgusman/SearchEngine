This dissertation research by a cultural
              anthropology student from Rice University will study the social and cultural
              life of credit cards in Greece.  The use of cards has increased dramatically in
              recent years, related to European Union integration. Through an ethnographic
              study in three distinct neighborhoods of Athens, from working class to upper
              class, the student will study how credit cards have been interpreted as
              cultural objects signifying "modernity" and will analyze the impact of the
              cards on those who use them as well as those who are excluded form using them. 
              The traditional cultural meaning of indebtedness will be studied as it has
              developed and changed in light of the new prevalence of impersonal credit. 
              Concerns with consumption, debt, status, and social mobility will be studied as
              well as general changes in Greek society affiliated with EU integration.
              Methods will include participant observation and a formal interview of about
              100 respondents drawn from the three neighborhoods, as well as follow up
              intensive and repeated interviews with a small subsample of 30 respondents (10
              from each neighborhood), interviews with bankers, and analysis of articles,
              records and documents on the credit card industry. This research will advance
              our understanding of how this ubiquitous financial instrument is being
              incorporated into a changing traditional society, and this new knowledge will
              help us understand the use of credit cards in our own society. The project also
              adds to the training of a young social scientist and increases our knowledge
              about this important region of the world.
