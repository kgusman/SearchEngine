Collaborative Research:  Elevated Atmospheric CO2 Alters Plant
              Detritus Nutritional Quality: Effects on Microbial and Detritivore Food Webs in
              Aquatic Ecosystems.

Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) resulting from
              the combustion of fossil fuels, directly affects the photosynthesis rate,
              growth, and chemical make-up of tree foliage.  The investigators have
              demonstrated that when aspen trees are grown under elevated CO2 levels, their
              leaves contain less nitrogen and higher concentrations of plant defense
              compounds (phenolic compounds, lignins and tannins), which renders them less
              nutritious to their animal and microorganism consumers.  Since small headwater
              streams in forested landscapes rely heavily on tree leaf litter to fuel their
              food webs, parallel field and laboratory studies will measure the effect that
              the CO2-induced change in food quality of aspen leaf litter will have on the
              growth and reproduction of stream bacteria, fungi, and invertebrate consumers. 
              The difference in microbial and invertebrate growth rates in turn could affect
              food web structure and functions and carbon dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.
