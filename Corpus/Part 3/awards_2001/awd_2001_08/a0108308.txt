Description: This award is to support a collaborative project
              between Dr. Ahmed Kamel, Department of Computer Science, North Dakota State
              University, Fargo, North Dakota and Dr. Ahmed Rafea, Department of Computer
              Science, The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt.  They plan to devise
              new capabilities for complex-problem solvers by utilizing two technologies, the
              knowledge-based system technology, which is a mature technology, and the
              intelligent agents technology which is emerging and is still evolving.  They
              plan to develop a distributed knowledge-based intelligent architecture for
              cooperative problem solving, and to test the new system in an application
              dealing with agricultural (wheat) production management. 

Scope: The project
              supports collaboration between a US scientist and an Egyptian scientist in a
              research project that is timely and which has significant potential
              applications.  The two PIs are currently collaborating on a project for the
              management of irrigated wheat in Egypt.  That project is generating a working
              set of applications that will be utilized as a test bed for the distributed
              knowledge-based intelligent architecture developed in this research.  Such
              architecture will be useful in many similar problems where the data sources and
              computer tools are geographically distributed.  The research will involve one
              US graduate student and two graduate students from Egypt.  This project meets
              the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual
              interest.
