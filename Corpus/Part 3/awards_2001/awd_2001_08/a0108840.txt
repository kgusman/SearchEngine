Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              development of an ultrafast TOC analyzer to enable real-time recycling of spent
              rinse waters from semiconductor wet benches.  At the present time,
              semiconductor fabrication facilities generate about 3800 gallons of wastewater
              discharge per wafer, which is equivalent to 53 million gallons of wastewater
              per year for facilities operating at 100 gpm (gallons per minute).  Recycling
              spent rinse waters from semiconductor wet benches provides a viable solution to
              dramatically reduce the environmental impact of this manufacturing process. 
              On-line monitoring of key contaminants in real time is necessary to
              successfully operate future water systems having recycle and reuse
              capabilities.  Phase I research will be directed at developing microfluidic
              sensors having reliable, ultra-fast response times to trace concentrations of
              organic contaminants found in spent r5inse waters from simiconductor wet
              benches.  Specific performance goals for Phase I devices include: <30 s
              response time, <30 ppb detection limit, operation in <10 microSiemen/cm water
              conductivity, and 100% +/- 30% recovery of key contaminants.

An ultra-fast
              TOC analyzer will be developed that enables real-time recycling of water used
              by seimiconductor manufacturing to reduce their demand upon regional water
              supplies.  This novel instrument will find widespread applications in the
              semiconductor industry as well as other manufacturing environments that require
              real-time detection of organic contaminants in aqueous effluent.
