     The investigator studies slow-fast decompositions
              and
bifurcations of trajectories in dynamical systems with multiple
time
              scales.  This extends the theory of bifurcation in generic
families of
              dynamical systems to those with two time scales.
Emphasis is placed upon
              relaxation oscillations, periodic orbits
that have both slow and fast
              segments.  The initial stages of the
work seek a classification of degenerate
              decompositions appearing
in periodic orbits of one parameter families with
              relaxation
oscillations.  Geometric methods are used to
              determine
bifurcations associated with each degenerate
              decomposition.
Numerical investigation of examples is used to motivate the
              work
and to ensure that the results are directly applicable to
biological
              models.  Together with collaborators Kathleen Hoffman
and Warren Weckesser,
              the investigator is reexamining a classical
example, the forced van der Pol
              system that gave birth to the
discovery of chaos for dissipative dynamical
              systems, and expects
to give a full description of the bifurcations that occur
              within
this system.  He also develops algorithms for the computation
              of
structures that are difficult to compute with existing methods.
    
              Rhythmic phenomena are ubiquitous in biological systems.
Examples include the
              heartbeat, the cell cycle, circadian
rhythms, legged locomotion, and
              electrical signals in the nervous
system.  Most of these involve multiple time
              scales.  The
investigator pursues new mathematical theory and
              computational
methods that apply to dynamical systems with multiple
              time
scales.  Emphasis is given to models of neural systems, an area
in which
              the presence and importance of complex dynamics are
manifest.  The
              investigations draw upon decades of research in
characterizing generic
              phenomena observed in dynamical systems
with a single time scale.  The
              resulting body of mathematics,
sometimes called chaos theory, needs extension
              and modification
to fully explain the behavior of systems with multiple
              time
scales.  Those extensions are the goal of this project.  On a
longer
              time frame, the project lays foundations for coming
generations of biological
              models for cellular processes such as
gene expression and signal transduction.
               New biotechnology leads
to ever more complicated reaction networks that are
              simulated as
dynamical systems.  This project produces results that aid
              the
implementation and interpretation of such simulations of
              complex,
multiple time scale dynamical systems.
