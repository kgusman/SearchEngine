Abstract    :
              There are indications that the dominant source of plasma for the plasma sheet
              and the near-Earth portion of the magnetosphere may be the ionosphere. Over the
              past two decades there have been numerous investigations involving spacecraft
              observations, radar observations, and simulations directed toward understanding
              the possible mechanisms that drive the upward/outward ionospheric plasma flow
              observed in the high-latitude F region above 500 km altitude.

A good
              empirical model has not been generated for the outflow (inflow) of plasma from
              (to) the auroral zone and polar cap as a function of geomagnetic activity,
              solar activity, and season. This proposal seeks to address this latter issue
              through the utilization of ion flow data from the Defense Meteorological
              Satellite Program (DMSP) series of spacecraft, flying in the topside F region
              at the 800 km altitude level. The database from these high duty cycle
              spacecraft observations extends from 1987 to the present, covering more than a
              complete solar cycle.

Major proposed tasks in performing this research are
              1) the determination of the seasonal variation in the plasma outflow in the
              topside F region, 2) investigation of the baseline values of the outflux and
              velocity structure and of the magnitude of storm-time perturbations in the
              plasma outflow, 3) performing a superposed epoch analysis to establish the
              characteristic response of the ionosphere to changes in magnetic activity, and
              4) development of an analytic model of plasma outflow suitable for use by the
              general scientific community.
