Abstract    :
              
Jackson State Community College (JSCC) is partnering with Austin Peay State
              University, the University of Tennessee at Martin, and Arkansas State
              University to develop three comprehensive articulation programs in Precision
              Agriculture: a 2+2 program, a 4+1 program, and a 3+1 program. These partnership
              programs ultimately lead to a Bachelor of Science degree in Precision
              Agriculture. The unique feature of these articulation agreements is that
              students not only transfer from the community college to the university, but
              also from the university to the community college. This inverted degree program
              with a "reverse transfer" format allows students to graduate from both JSCC and
              a four-year institution, with the fourth year spent at JSCC. JSCC holds
              technologically sophisticated equipment not available at the partnering
              universities, and it has developed a number of innovative courses to provide
              experiential learning opportunities to students in this field. The Precision
              Agriculture program provides students with theoretical background and hands-on
              experience in agronomy, GIS, GPS, and computer science. A unique combinations
              of courses and experiences train students to work in the precision agriculture
              industry.
