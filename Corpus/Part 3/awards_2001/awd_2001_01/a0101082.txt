Abstract    :
              The last 30 years have witnessed a major transformation in American Trade
              Policy.  Until the 1970s, the U.S. government used high tariffs and import
              quotas to protect troubled industries.  Starting in the mid-1970s, those were
              replaced with 'fair trade' policies, a modified form of protectionism. 
              However, government success in including these new policies under GATT has
              varied considerably across industries.  This project attempts to explain why
              the U.S. government has changed its trade policy preferences, and why its
              ability to turn these preferences into official policies has varied.  In so
              doing, it sheds light on how states deal with global forces, international
              relations, and domestic institutions in developing policy.

To reach these
              goals, the project gathers data from archival and secondary sources, such as
              government reports, trade journals, Congressional hearings, GATT publications,
              and interviews with key figures, to compare trade policy both over time and
              across industries.  The over-time component compares trade policies and
              international agreements formed in the 1960s/1970s with those formed in the
              1980s.  The cross-industry component compares policy trajectories in textiles,
              steel, and civil aircraft -- three industries that have gone through economic
              difficulties and experienced a significant shift in the trade policies
              affecting their products.
