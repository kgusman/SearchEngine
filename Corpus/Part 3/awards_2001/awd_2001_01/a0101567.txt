Abstract    :
              Phi Theta Kappa, the honor society for two-year colleges, in cooperation with
              the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), is conducting a
              multi-disciplinary, multi-component, nationwide mentoring project to enhance
              and expand the role of community colleges in providing teacher preparation
              programs for future K-12 science and mathematics teachers. 

This project
              responds to the recommendation areas put forth in the NSF report, "Investing in
              Tomorrow's Teachers: The Integral Role of Two Year Colleges in the Science and
              Mathematics Preparation of Prospective Teachers." Project objectives are being
              accomplished through a set of proven mentoring activities that extend, for
              replication and/or adaptation, the knowledge, experience and materials achieved
              by seven community college teacher preparation programs recognized as exemplary
              by NSF --first to 18 competitively selected community colleges, and then, via
              extensive dissemination activities, to community, technical, and junior
              colleges nationwide.

Project activities include: national competition to
              select 18 colleges; two National Teacher Preparation Conferences, at which
              mentors, and resource persons from their four-year college partners, work with
              their assigned four-member college teams to develop action plans; mentoring
              services, including site visits, throughout the project; a periodic
              networking/collaboration-building newsletter, available electronically and in
              print; a case study monograph for distribution to presidents, academic deans,
              education chairs, science or mathematics chairs, and education institutions in
              the participating colleges regions; and a broad range of other dissemination
              activities through Phi Theta Kappa and AACC websites, conferences, and
              publications. The 18 community colleges selected to participate are each
              working with one assigned community college educator/mentor and one four year
              college resource person from exemplary teacher preparation programs at El
              Camino College, CA; William Rainey Harper College, IL; Henry Ford Community
              College, MI; Tulsa Community College, OK; Community College of Philadelphia,
              PA; Prince George's Community College, MD; and Green River Community College,
              WA. Mentors and resource persons represent disciplines of mathematics, biology,
              physics, chemistry, and education. 

Taken as a whole, these teacher
              preparation programs address NSF's teacher preparation recommendation areas:
              recruitment of prospective teachers; strengthening undergraduate courses and
              infrastructure; preservice experiences; inservice activities; and liaison
              between two and four year institutions.
