Abstract    :
              The investigators propose to study the electrodynamics of the coupled
              magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) system in the vicinity of the region-2 shielding
              currents that link the inner plasma sheet and inner magnetosphere to the
              auroral and subauroral ionosphere. The project will focus on two outstanding
              physics questions: (1) the effects of field-aligned potential drops on global
              electric field and precipitation patterns, and (2) the physical mechanisms
              involved in the generation of Polarization Jet (PJ) events. The principal tool
              for carrying out the proposed investigation will be the Rice Convection Model
              (RCM), an established computer model that self-consistently follows the time
              evolution of electric fields, currents, and plasma flow velocities in the
              quasi-static approximation. Improvements in the numerical machinery and
              algorithms of the RCM will be implemented, as needed, to investigate these
              phenomena. Model results will be archived and visualization tools provided to
              facilitate comparisons with data from incoherent scatter radars and
              polar-orbiting spacecraft, and with empirically derived patterns of electric
              fields developed within the context of the NSF CEDAR initiative. Comparisons
              with observational data will be carried out in collaboration with Utah State
              University and as part of the GEM Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling Campaign.
