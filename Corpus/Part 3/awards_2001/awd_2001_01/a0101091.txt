Abstract    :
              As members of a minority group become integrated into the dominant society, they
              may lose their ethnic identification through a process of assimilation.  To
              test theories of assimilation, this project examines the self-identification of
              third and fourth generation Americans of Mexican ancestry, and how this
              self-identification is shaped by high levels of ongoing Mexican immigration.
              Using national-level census data and personal interviews conducted in two U.S.
              cities, the project makes special efforts to measure ethnic identification.  It
              then uses quantitative and qualitative methods to first assess the impact of
              generation, educational attainment, and residential ethnic concentration of
              immigrants on Mexican-American intermarriage and the identity of children of
              such unions.  It next examines how social context and culture shape the
              self-identity of later-generation Mexican-Americans.  And it lastly draws out
              the implications of Mexican self-identity for deciding how to respond to
              questions in the U.S. census about ethnicity.
