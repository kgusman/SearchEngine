Abstract    :
              

Microzooplankton, grazing organisms < 200 gm in size, have a central role in
              marine pelagic food webs and are significant consumers of phytoplankton and a
              major food resource for larger zooplankton. The PI's will provide detailed
              information on microzooplankton stocks in the GLOBEC California Current System
              (CCS), in the context of physical, chemical, and biological data collected in
              the CCS Long Term Observation Program (LTOP).  They will document temporal
              (seasonal and interannual) and spatial (along-shore and from coast to offshore)
              variability in distribution of microzooplanktonic protists in the CCS. The
              specific objectives of the research are: 1) Retrospective analysis of
              microzooplankton stocks in the CCS from samples collected along the Newport
              (NH) line off Oregon in September 1997 during a strong El Nino, and in
              September 1998 after relaxation of the El Nino event, 2) Seasonal/regional
              sampling of microzooplankton stocks in the CCS as part of the LTOP program
              through September 2003, 3) Analysis of spatial and interannual variability in
              microzoo-plankton stocks with respect to environmental parameters collected as
              part of the LTOP cruises, and 4) Estimating potential rates of herbivory by
              microzooplankton, and significance of microzooplankton as a food resource for
              mesozooplankton, for use in CCS food web models.  Data will include abundance
              and carbon biomass of general taxonomic groups of microzooplankton, and
              observations of ingested prey in protist food vacuoles and of the abundance of
              mixotrophic ciliates. Results from the retrospective analysis of
              microzooplankton standing stocks, and from our sampling program during the LTOP
              cruises in 2000-2003 will be processed, archived and disseminated to other
              GLOBEC investigators as the data become available. The results of this study
              will provide important data for CCS ecosystem modelers, and will also be
              valuable in comparisons of CCS and Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA) ecosystem
              dynamics.
