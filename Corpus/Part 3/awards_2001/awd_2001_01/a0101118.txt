Abstract    :
              As coupled magnetospheric, ionospheric and thermospheric models mature it is
              increasingly apparent that Joule heating may take place over a wide variety of
              spatial scale sizes. Current models used for space weather estimate Joule
              heating rates by using average bulk plasma flow velocities (Vb) in large-scale
              high-latitude convection patterns. However, recent studies suggest that
              structure in the ion drift over smaller scale sizes of 10 to 100 km may change
              the estimated Joule heating rate by more than a factor of 2. This proposal will
              use data from the Dynamics Explorer-2 satellite and from the DMSP satellites to
              describe the average and maximum amplitude of velocity structure (AV) at high
              latitudes as a function of position, season, solar cycle and geomagnetic
              activity. Thus, Joule heating rates previously calculated using only the
              average bulk flow rate Vb of the plasma will be improved to become a function
              of Vb + AV. The data description will be cast in the form of a model that
              functionally describes the magnitude of the velocity structure in terms of the
              bulk flow so that these refined estimates of Joule heating rates can be easily
              used both in thermospheric models and as boundary conditions for coupling
              magnetospheric models with the ionosphere. A first order dependence of the
              model on magnetic activity will allow a better specification of the high
              latitude thermosphere and ionosphere for space weather applications.
