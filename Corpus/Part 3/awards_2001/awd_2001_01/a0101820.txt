Abstract    :
              This project supports the need for tribal communities to have a Native American
              work force who can help meet their local needs in science education and in the
              management of their resources. The main objective is to increase the number and
              quality of community college students who transfer into Bachelor of Science
              K-12 teaching programs or environmental science programs. Emphasis is being
              placed upon Tribally Controlled Colleges (TCCs) using environmental science as
              an educational implementation mechanism. Strategies used to address this
              objective include development of recruitment programs for each participating
              TCC, development of recruitment programs, faculty/student articulation
              agreements, transition support for the students to successfully enter an
              appropriate baccalaureate program, support for student retention, dissemination
              of program results and program evaluation. The project utilizes a successful
              student retention program, the Mesa State College New Environmental Student
              Transition (MSC-NEST), as a model developed to attract, motivate, and retain
              students. The focus is upon using the Environmental Science and Technology
              Bachelor of Science degree program as a model articulation partnership program
              with the participating community colleges. This degree program enables a
              student to select either a K-12 teaching degree path or an environmental
              science/technology related degree.
