The
              proposal divides into four projects in the related fields of
two dimensional
              dynamical systems and geometric group theory.
The goal of the first, which is
              a collaboration with Mark Feighn,
is to compute, in a transparent, geometric
              and algorithmic way,
the centralizer of an element of the outer
              automorphism
group. The second is to continue the principal
              investigator's
study of the forcing order on braid types in the four
              times
punctured disk.  This project has both an experimental and
theoretical
              part.  Computer programs are used to generate
examples and to aid in the
              formation of conjectures. Once
conjectures are made that cannot be disproved
              by computer,
rigorous proofs will be attempted.  The third project is
              a
collaboration with John Franks with the long term goal of proving
that
              generic area preserving diffeomorphisms of the two
dimensional sphere have
              dense periodic orbits.  The more
immediate goal is to find analogs for generic
              area preserving
diffeomorphisms of the topological structure that is known
              to
exist for twist maps.  The fourth is a collaboration with Lee
Mosher.  The
              first steps in the project will be to identify and
study quasi-lines that can
              play the role in Culler Vogtmann space
that Teichmuller geodesics play in
              Teichmuller space.

This proposal is concerned with the interface between two
              areas
of mathematics: two dimensional dynamical systems and geometric
group
              theory.  The former studies the long term behavior of
systems that evolve over
              time, while the latter treats algebraic
objects by geometric means.  The
              fields have been intertwined for
more than fifty years and have been the focus
              of a great deal of
research in the past twenty.  Part of the proposal focuses
              on two
long standing fundamental questions in two dimensional
              dynamical
systems.  The first examines how simple systems change into
chaotic
              ones.  The second concerns transformations of the sphere
that preserve area,
              and asks whether every piece of the sphere
contains at least one point that
              eventually (as the system
evolves) returns to its original position.  There
              are two groups
(in the technical algebraic sense) that are most closely
              related
to two dimensional dynamical systems.  They are the mapping
              class
group and the outer automorphism group.  To understand the
geometry of
              a group one must understand its geodesics; i.e. what
the shortest paths are
              between any two points.  The geodesics of
the mapping class group have been
              well understood for some time.
The principal investigator will generalize from
              what is known
about the geodesics of the mapping class group to identify
              and
study geodesics for the outer automorphism group.
