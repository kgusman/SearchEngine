This
              project involves two distinct areas: 4-dimensional
manifolds, and
              high-dimensional controlled topology.  Recent
successes with topological
              4-manifolds suggest the time is ripe
to try to formulate surgery obstructions
              for arbitrary
fundamental groups. Improved understanding of
              handlebody
structures and a new construction of topological field theories
in
              dimension 4 offer hopes for combinatorially-defined invariants
of smooth
              4-manifolds. In the controlled area recent work with
Ranicki has provided a
              proof of an elusive stability theorem for
controlled surgery obstructions.
              This may point the way to a full
description of the groups as generalized
              homology, analogous to
earlier descriptions of the end and controlled
              h-cobordism
obstructions. Such a description would have applications
              ranging
from local structure in stratified sets to sharpening
              2-torsion
conclusions in some cases of the Novikov conjecture.

This project
              explores the boundary between the discrete and
continuous worlds. Geometry and
              analysis (continuous points of
view) have revealed strange behavior in
              dimension 4. In terms of
the mathematics used in physics, other dimensions are
              "classical"
while dimension 4 seems to be "quantum." 
              Topologically
4-dimensional objects are described in terms of
              3-dimensional
building blocks (a discrete point of view), particularly
              knots
and links in 3-space. One objective is to bridge the gap between
these
              two views, and in particular understand the quantum
behavior from the
              topological point of view. In higher dimensions
algebraic and qualitative
              topology (e.g.  surgery theory) are
discrete points of view. Twenty years ago
              the PI bridged the gap
between this and local continuous topology in one
              case,
"pseudoisotopy." This has had numerous applications. Many
              more
applications await a widening of this bridge to include other
cases, for
              instance algebraic K-theory and surgery, but the
methods are complex and
              intensely technical and have so far
resisted extension. The other objective of
              the project is to
carry through these generalizations.
