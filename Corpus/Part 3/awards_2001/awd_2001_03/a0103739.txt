The project can be conditionally divided into
              the following (related) 
parts: Study of periodic metrics (including
              area-minimizing properties 
of flats in normed spaces, symplectic filling
              volumes for Finsler
metrics, asymptotic volume growth of Finsler tori,
              Riemannian metrics 
without conjugate points on products, and Lagrangian
              systems on tori 
without conjugate points); Relationship between bi-Lipschitz
              equivalence 
and quasi-isometries (with the most intriguing cases of general
              Penrose 
tilings and finitely presented groups, including co-compact lattices
              in 
the same Lie group); Products of non-commuting maps, flows of positive
              
metric entropy, and sequential dynamics; Applications of geometry of
              
non-positive curvature to algorithmics and dynamics; Geometry of
              
non-negatively-curved manifolds (foliations by minimal surfaces, 
isolated 
              flat totally geodesic tori); the PI's graduate students work 
on 
              generalizations of the Finite Distance Theorem to non-Abelian groups,
              
approximations of embedded surfaces with small variation  of Gaussian
              
curvature by developing surfaces, constructing Lipschitz homeomorphisms
              
with prescribed Jacobians, generating certain groups by products of
              
conjugates of elements from a bounded subset.


The first part of the
              project deals with large-scale invariants of 
periodic metrics. Their physical
              analogs are macroscopic properties of 
periodic media  (such as a crystal
              substance), and the problem is to 
understand how such properties can be
              recovered from microscopic 
characteristics and vice versa. A large part of
              the project belongs to 
a borderline between geometry and dynamics, and in
              particular new 
applications of geometric methods. For instance, problems of
              stability 
in sequential dynamics model situations where the laws of evolution
              of 
an object (for instance, a physical  or an ecological system) are subject
              
to small perturbations; it is desirable to understand the result of such
              
perturbations in the large time scale. There are also  applications of
              
modern geometry of singular spaces to problems originated from statistical
              
physics (such as estimates on the number of collisions of particles in 
gas
              models, a problem that goes back to Boltzmann), and to computational 
problems
              (such as: how to numerically find a shortest path between
around several
              obstacles). The last part of the project deals with 
stability of geometric
              objects described  by curvature-type 
characteristics. Indeed, whenever we
              study a geometric object 
(for instance, a surface), we deal with imprecise
              information. Thus it is 
important to understand whether small deviations in
              this information 
can result in crucial changes for the geometric object (or
              even a 
non-existence of a model object).
