The
              motivating theme of geometric group theory is that finitely
generated groups
              can be studied using topological and geometric
methods.  Starting around 1980,
              Gromov proposed classifying
groups geometrically using the relation of
              quasi-isometry.  He
demonstrated that the quasi-isometry class of a group G
              can often
be described explicitly in simple algebraic or geometric terms,
              a
process now referred to as ``quasi-isometric rigidity'' or
``QI-rigidity''
              for the group G. The first part of this project
will be to investigate
              QI-rigidity problems for graphs of surface
groups and of abelian groups.  An
              initial focus will be those
graphs of groups with the simplest algebraic
              structure, namely
semidirect products with free groups, determined by
              a
homomorphism from a free group into an appropriate automorphism
group such
              as the mapping class group of a surface.  General
graphs of surface groups are
              determined by homomorphisms into the
commensurability mapping class group, a
              much more mysterious
object, and this point of view will be used to
              investigate
constructions of new and interesting examples.  Also, recent
              work
on graphs of abelian groups has revealed a lot of rich
              structure,
suggesting a real possibility of obtaining QI-rigidity in many
new
              cases.  In the second part of this project, the focus will be
to study
              geometric properties of free groups, motivated by
analogies between surface
              groups and free groups.  In particular,
Thurston's ending lamination
              conjecture, an important goal in the
study of surface groups, has an analogue
              in the study of free
groups, in terms of classifying certain group actions up
              to
equivariant quasi-isometry.  Pursuing this issue will require
generalizing
              many of the standard tools of surface groups, such
as geodesics in Teichmuller
              space, to the setting of free groups.

Geometric group theory is the study of
              infinitely symmetric
patterns.  Popular examples called ``surface groups''
              are
familiar from wallpaper symmetries and from the symmetries of
Escher's
              prints.  Scientific examples occur in the symmetry
groups of crystalline
              arrays, and the symmetry groups of field
theories in particle physics.  The
              development of topology
starting in the late 19th century, and the
              concomitant
development of combinatorial group theory, exhibited a
              direct
link between abstract groups and geometry.  The need for
              deeper
understanding of this link has been demonstrated again and again
by
              different threads within 20th century mathematical
developments.  Many of
              these threads were pulled together around
1980 by Gromov, whose proposed
              unification of geometric group
theory using the relation of ``quasi-isometry''
              has been very
fruitful in the intervening twenty years.  The focus of
              this
research project will be to investigate quasi-isometric
classification
              problems for several different types of symmetry
groups.  In particular, by
              using a constructive technique known
as ``graphs of groups'', new symmetry
              groups can be constructed
out of familiar examples such as surface groups;
              these and
closely related constructions will be the subjects of this
research
              project.
