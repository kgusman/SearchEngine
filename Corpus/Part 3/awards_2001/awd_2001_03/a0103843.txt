The
              principal investigator will focus on two problems in the
Teichmuller theory
              and 3-manifold topology. In Teichmuller
theory, the aim of the investigation
              is to understand the complex
structure on the Teichmuller space by
              constructing holomorphic
functions arising from flat singular metric
              uniformization of the
Riemann surface. We have produced many naturally defined
              complex
valued functions on the Teichmuller space. The goal is to show
that
              they are holomorphic. This will give us a better
understanding of the complex
              structure which is of vital
importance to the Teichmuller theory.  In
              3-manifold topology, we
propose to show that any non-trivial 3-manifold group
              has a
non-trivial SL(2,F) representation for some field F. We have
translated
              the existence problem into a problem concerning how
simple loops propagate in
              a surface.  With the recent advance of
our knowledge on surfaces, one may
              eventually solve the problem
using surface topology.  The existence of SL
              (2,F)
representations will have many important consequences in
3-manifold
              topology.

A 3-manifold is a space in which every point has a
              small
surrounding similar to our real world.  It is an important
mathematical
              problem to classify all 3-manifolds. One of the main
tool developed in recent
              decades in 3-manifolds theory is to use
geometry. In particular, the geometry
              of surfaces has been used
very successfully in understanding the 3-dimensional
              spaces.  The
proposed work addresses the topology of 3-manifolds and
              the
geometry of surfaces.  We attempt to use the symmetry theory
(SL(2)
              representation theory) to understand the fundamental group
of 3-manifolds
              which is a vital invariant of 3-manifolds.  The
SL(2,C) representation theory
              has been used very successfully in
recent years by many topologists. Our
              approach seems to be new
and uses simple loops on surfaces.  The second part
              of the
proposed work addresses the geometry of surfaces. One of the
              main
problems on surface geometry is the moduli space problem. The
moduli
              space problem asks for, for instance, what is the shape of
the space of all
              convex polyhedrons which look like a cube.  Many
geometric problems are best
              expressed in terms of the topology
and geometry of the moduli space. The
              corresponding object for
high genus surface is the Teichmuller space. In
              contrasts to the
topology of the Teichmuller space which is well understood
              for
about 60 years, the geometry of it is much less understood. Our
proposed
              work is an attempt to understand explicitly the complex
analytic geometry of
              the Teichmuller space. The explicit
description of the complex geometry of the
              Teichmuller space will
have applications not only in mathematics but also in
              physics,
for instance in string theory.
