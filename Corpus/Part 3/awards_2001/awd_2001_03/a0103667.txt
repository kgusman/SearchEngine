The goal of this project is to better understand
              the 
structure of mapping class groups and then to apply this 
knowledge to
              the problem of understanding motives over 
the spectrum of the integers. The
              Principal Investigator 
hopes to compute the stable highest weight
              decomposition 
of the graded quotients of the lower central series of 
the
              Torelli groups (tensored with the reals) as modules 
over the real symplectic
              group of rank g. This should be 
of interest to those studying 3-manifold
              invariants. The 
Principal Investigator plans to use his knowledge of
              this
stable decomposition to study the image of the Galois group 
of the
              rational numbers on appropriate completions of mapping 
class groups. In
              particular, he (in joint work with Makoto 
Matsumoto) hopes to be able to
              characterize the Zariski 
closure of the image of the Galois group in the
              group of 
outer automorphisms of the relative unipotent completion 
of
              mapping class groups of large genus. This should lead 
to improved
              understanding of the connections between Hodge 
Theory and Galois Theory; in
              particular, to improved 
understanding of the role of mixed zeta numbers in
              Galois theory.
The Principal Investigator also plans to study the
              
pseudoconvexity of the moduli spaces of curves. 
Looijenga has conjectured
              that there is a proper,
non-negative, (g-2)-pseudoconvex real-valued function
              
defined on the moduli space of genus g curves. Hain, in 
joint work with
              Looijenga, hopes to prove that the function 
that he constructed with David
              Reed several years ago is 
such a function. This result would lead to new
              vanishing
results for coherent cohomology of moduli spaces of curves 
as well
              as unified proofs of several results of Diaz and 
Harer on the topology of
              these moduli spaces.

Topology is the study of those geometrical properties
              
of surfaces and their generalizations that remain unchanged 
under
              stretching (short of tearing) and other continuous 
deformations. Geometry is
              the study of those properties 
of surfaces and their generalizations that
              preserve geometric
properties such as distances and/or angles. There is a
              profound connection between the topological symmetries of a surface
(called
              the mapping class group of the surface), the geometry 
of all of the different
              ways of measuring angles on such a 
surface (the moduli space of conformal
              structures on the surface)  
and the arithmetical properties of the surface
              when viewed as 
the graph of a polynomial. Questions about mapping
              class
groups and moduli spaces of conformal structures on surfaces 
arise in
              many areas of mathematics (such as the study of numbers, 
and algebraic
              geometry), and have applications to particle 
physics through string theory
              and conformal field theory. There 
are also potential significant applications
              to cryptography. The 
goal of this proposal is to further explore and
              understand the intricate and deep connections between these topological,
              
geometrical and arithmetical aspects of surface theory,
especially those
              aspects with connections to number theory.
