The primary objective of this research program is to
              observe and quantitatively characterize, on the nanometer (10-9 meters) scale,
              the complex interactions that occur between microorganisms (specifically
              bacteria) and minerals.  These interactions are ubiquitous in soils and rocks
              near the Earth's surface.  We hypothesize that microbe-mineral interactions,
              when studied directly at the nanoscale, will result in the discovery of exotic
              behavior relative to current concepts and models that seek to explain
              mineral-microbe association and dependence.  In order to accomplish our goal,
              we will depend heavily on biological force microscopy (BFM), a variation of the
              atomic force microscope that we have developed in our lab over the last two
              years.  This technique, for the first time, allows for the direct measurement
              of forces (both attractive/repulsive and adhesive) between fully functional
              cells and any other substrate as a function of separation distance. 
              Reproducible and reliable measurements between bacteria and mineral surfaces
              are readily obtained with nano- to pico (10-12)-Newton force resolution while
              at the same time controlling their separation to the nanometer level.  This has
              already given us an unprecedented view of the intricacies on mineral-microbe
              interaction as a function of water chemistry, microbial physiology, and surface
              mineralogy.  Practical application of this work includes the development of a
              new generation of transport model for microorganisms in surface or subsurface
              environments, using the wealth of nanoscale information obtained from our BFM
              and associated measurements.  Such models should be very useful in developing
              more robust subsurface bioremediation strategies in the future.  This proposal
              was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering" (NSF 00-119).
