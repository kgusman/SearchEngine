The goal of this project is to try to
              understand 
the topology underlying quantum invariants in three 
dimensions.
              The current state of knowledge seems inadequate 
for explaining what kind of
              topological information the 
invariants carry, and therefore what kind of
              applications 
in three-dimensional topology they might have. However it
has
              revealed (through the frameworks of TQFT and Vassiliev 
theory) a wealth of
              very interesting algebraic structures, 
which seem to be specifically related
              to topology in three 
dimensions, and so should be thought of as kind of
              
``new algebraic topology'' in three dimensions.
Roberts intends to try to
              bridge the gap between this new 
topology and classical algebraic topology.
              There are three 
main areas of investigation. The first is K-theory, which
              
could help to explain the relationship between quantum knot 
invariants and
              Vassiliev invariants (for example, why the 
Jones polynomial is a polynomial).
              The second is Rozansky-Witten theory, a very interesting new example of a TQFT
              which 
provides new hints about intepretation of the invariants, 
and could
              have additional applications in complex or 
hyperkaehler geometry.  The third
              is the hyperbolic volume 
conjecture of Kashaev, Murakami and Murakami. This
              conjecture 
seems to fit into a general pattern of ideas relating
              
quantization (and specifically, 6j-symbols) to classical
geometry; ideas
              which might provide a conceptual context 
for the conjecture.

To a
              mathematician, a knot is what you get by tangling up a 
piece of string and
              then gluing its ends together. It is clear 
that there are qualitatively
              different ways of doing this; 
trying to describe and understand these ways
              forms a branch 
of topology, which might be thought of as what remains of
              
geometry when quantitative questions are ignored. The main 
tools of knot
              theory are "topological invariants", numbers 
which can be associated to knots
              and which encode some
information about their structure. During the last
              sixteen 
years, ideas borrowed from the physics of quantum field 
theory have
              led to the discovery of many new and beautiful 
invariants called "quantum
              invariants", but because of this 
unusual origin, their meaning remains very
              mysterious, and 
their potential unfulfilled. The goal of the project is to
              
use some new ideas to try to explain this mystery and to
bridge some of the
              gaps between geometry, topology, and 
physics. The work should contribute to
              the healthy exchange 
of ideas between these disciplines, and stimulate new
              work in each.
