The
              Project proposes to study several geometric problems in
dimension 2 and 3. A
              common theme is that these problems all
involve hyperbolic geometry, either as
              a tool to understand wider
range problems or as a topic of interest in itself.
              The first
half of the proposal is a natural extension of the
              research
developed by the Principal Investigator in the past few years.
              On
the purely hyperbolic side, it proposes to study convex cores
              of
hyperbolic structures on 3-dimensional manifolds, and to further
develop
              an approach to hyperbolic structures on surfaces which is
based on the
              technique of geodesic currents. On the more
topological side, it proposes to
              take advantage of methods of
hyperbolic geometry to analyze simple closed
              curves on
surfaces. In particular, one of the objectives of the proposal
              is
to determine the fractal dimension of the space of simple closed
curves on
              a surface. The second part of the proposal is based on
exciting new
              conjectures which would connect two aspects of the
theory of knotted curves in
              3--dimensional space which so far
have had very little interaction, namely
              topological quantum
field theory and hyperbolic geometry on knot complements.
              The
project proposes to attack these conjectures and, if these are
proved, to
              further develop the connections so established.

The proposed research is
              focused on the interplay between
hyperbolic geometry and topology. In
              low-dimensional topology,
one tries to analyze the possible shapes for spaces
              of dimensions
2 and 3. In particular, it includes as a subfield knot
              theory,
where the goal is to understand all possible ways in which a
string
              can be knotted in space; techniques of knot theory have
successfully been
              applied to analyze the recombination of DNA and
the knotting of complex
              molecular structures. Hyperbolic geometry
is apparently very different. It is
              a non-euclidean geometry
which was introduced in the early nineteenth century,
              in order to
test the internal consistency of the axioms of the
              classical
geometry developed by Euclid and other Greek mathematicians.
              An
unexpected connection was established in the nineteen seventies,
through
              ground breaking work of Bill Thurston who showed that
hyperbolic geometry
              could be successfully used to solve problems
in topology. For instance, there
              is a number associated to each
knotted curve, called its "hyperbolic volume"
              and which can be
computed fairly easily by current software. If two knotted
              curves
have different hyperbolic volumes, one is guaranteed that it
              is
impossible to deform one curve to the other. A new picture is
              now
beginning to emerge, where the hyperbolic volume of a knotted
curve
              unexpectedly occurs in techniques of mathematical physics
originally designed
              to predict the behavior of high energy
particles. The main part of the
              proposal is aimed at clarifying
this picture, with the expectation that the
              cross-fertilization
between topology, hyperbolic geometry and mathematical
              physics
will lead to advances in each of these three fields.
