              Abstract:
Support of student participation in the North American
              Paleontological Convention (NAPC-2001) June 26-July 1, 2001

The North
              American Paleontological Convention is a quadrennial meeting of paleontologists
              from a variety of disciplines.  It is supported by paleontological societies
              headquartered in North America, and is open to all who are interested in
              paleontology.  The meeting planned for June 26 through July 1, 2001 in
              Berkeley, CA will be the seventh NAPC.  Each previous convention has been
              judged an excellent opportunity for the presentation of the results of new
              research and for discussions of current areas of paleontological research.  One
              aim of NAPC is to allow specialists who would not otherwise normally be in
              contact to meet and exchange ideas.  Based on past experience, the Organizing
              Committee for NAPC-2001 expects that over 500 professionals will attend and
              interact during four days of meetings and on several field trips.

The
              Organizing Committee believes that the continued interest of students and young
              professionals is critical to the health of the field.  Not only will they
              maintain the study of past life, they are the ones who will provide fresh
              approaches and examine old fossils with new eyes.  NAPC provides an outstanding
              educational opportunity to obtain focused presentations of paleontological
              information from talks and poster presentations without the other distractions
              presented at a general geological meeting.  It also allows students the ready
              opportunity to meet with leaders in the field and to discuss their research in
              progress, both formally and informally, in a venue not provided by a national
              or regional geologic meeting.

This proposal requests $25,000 to support the
              attendance at NAPC-2001 of students and young professionals from the U.S.,
              Mexico and other countries where students and professionals work on North
              American paleontology.
