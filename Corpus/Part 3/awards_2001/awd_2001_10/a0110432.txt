Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new
              instrumentation for fluorescence and phosphorescence spectral measurements. 
              Phase I produced a customized spectrofluorimeter equipped with a tunable laser
              source, fluorescence lifetime capability, and fiber optic probe for cryogenic
              measurements.   However, better methods are needed to analyze benzo[c]fluorene,
              which researchers now believe may be an environmental concern comparable to
              benzo[a]pyrene.  Phase II will develop an upgraded new instrument, capable of
              retrofitting the low temperature probe, fluorescence lifetime, and tunable
              laser capabilities onto laboratory spectrofluorimeters.  The emission
              monochromator, photomultiplier tube detector, and control/analysis computer can
              be retained from the spectrofluorimeter, and none of its functionality will be
              lost.  Phase II is expected to produce several models of commercial
              spectrofluorimeters, test data for publication in technical journals and trade
              magazines, and instrument upgrade options as a commercial service.

The
              market for these upgrades presently has an estimated 30,000-40,000
              spectrofluorimeters in service.  An additional 4,000 individuals or
              institutions purchase new units each year.   The new instrument upgrades will
              be used in research and development, analytical services, quality control,
              environmental studies and surveys, and teaching and other applications.
