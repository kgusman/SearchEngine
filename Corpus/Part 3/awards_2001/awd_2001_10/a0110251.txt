This conference on dynamical systems at SUNY Stony Brook in 2001
is
              held in honor of John Milnor and emphasizes areas of dynamics
close to his own
              work: holomorphic dynamics in one and several
variables, non-uniformly
              hyperbolic dynamics, fluid dynamics,
geometric function theory and
              thermodynamical formalism, related
topics in topology and in
              biology.

Dynamical systems are mathematical models of phenomena that
evolve
              in time according to deterministic laws.  Some aspects of
this part of
              mathematics are extremely classical, since the
differential equations used by
              Newton to describe motion under
the force of gravity lead to a dynamical
              system.  Although these
models are entirely determined by starting conditions
              and the
rules for evolution over time, detailed prediction is difficult
and
              we are obliged to seek qualitative understanding.  Over the
last twenty-five
              years much attention has concentrated on systems
whose evolutionary rule is
              defined by a polynomial function of a
complex variable, and on the behavior of
              these systems as the
polynomial's coefficients are changed.  This class of
              systems has
been found to be a universal model in some ways for the
              behavior
of families of dynamical behavior depending upon a parameter,
              but
despite their simplicity of definition much remains mysterious
about
              holomorphic dynamical systems.
