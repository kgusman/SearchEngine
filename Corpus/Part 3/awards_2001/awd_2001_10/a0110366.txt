Abstract    :
              Amnesia and other related cognitive problems are often a result of dysfunction
              of one of three interconnected memory systems:  the temporal lobe, the
              diencephalon, and the basal forebrain.  The goal of the present research is to
              use behavioral and neurochemical assays to examine how the diencephalon
              modulates the integrative role of the hippocampus-a key temporal lobe structure
              in memory processing.  To investigate these issues a rodent model of
              diencephalic amnesia, pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency, will be used.
              Pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency creates lesions within the
              diencephalon, disrupting many important memory pathways. The loss of
              diencephalic structures may down-regulate the activation of other
              memory-related structures such as the hippocampus thereby impairing their
              contributions to learning and memory processing.  To investigate
              diencephalic-hippocampal interactions in memory processing the proposed studies
              will use in- vivo microdialysis to determine whether acetylcholine release in
              the hippocampus, a marker of memory-related activation, is altered in rats with
              these lesions when learning spatial tasks. The goal of this Minority Career
              Advancement award is to build upon the recipient's prior research on animal
              models of memory dysfunction and allow her to advance her research program by
              learning techniques (in-vivo microdialysis and HPLC) to examine functional
              neurochemical changes associated with learning and memory. This project will
              provide new insights into understanding how several memory-related brain
              structures interact
