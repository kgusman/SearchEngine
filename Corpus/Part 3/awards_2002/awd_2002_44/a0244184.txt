Abstract    :
              The Rice University Summer Institute of Statistics (RUSIS) will train and mentor
              12 selected junior and senior underrepresented minority students, and students
              with no easy access to a career experience at their institution. The underlying
              motivation for the Institute is the fundamental interest in attracting more
              underrepresented minority students into graduate work in the Mathematical and
              Statistical Sciences, and facilitating their transition into research work.
              These objectives will be accomplished through the following
              mechanisms:

-Intensive core courses in probability, stochastic processes,
              and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest.
              (e.g.  multiple comparisons, extreme value theory, multivariate survival
              analysis, statistical genetics, and massive data methodologies). 

-Engaging
              the students in research projects under close collaboration with faculty
              mentors, with the goal of producing joint publications. Students will be
              mentored in the preparation of their work for presentation in national
              meetings.

- Short courses on the use of Unix platforms, latex, and software
              to be utilized for research purposes such as Mathematica and Splus.

-Visits
              to scientific facilities (e.g., Biomathematics and Biostatistics Departments at
              MD Anderson Cancer Center, NASA, Shell Oil) will be organized, and a series of
              lectures, by a variety of scientists, which are part of an AGEP funded program,
              will be attended. These lectures cover a variety of topics ranging from
              applying to Graduate School to career experiences by outstanding
              scientists.

-Evaluation and monitoring of the progress of students for seven
              years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their
              participation; annual evaluation of the program by the participating students
              and an external advisory committee.

RUSIS is a 10-week summer program.
              Students with a mathematical background that includes three semesters of
              calculus, and one semester of linear algebra or matrix analysis, should contact
              the PI Javier Rojo (email: jrojo@rice.edu 713-348-2797) or Theresa Chatman
              (tlc@rice.edu 713-348-5180).
