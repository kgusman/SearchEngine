The
              topology/geometry group in the Department of Mathematics at
Cornell University
              requests funding to continue support for three
years for the Cornell Topology
              Festival, which this group has
hosted each year since 1963. The Festival
              provides a significant
arena for the dissemination and development of
              important, new
results from a wide array of areas within the realms
              of
algebraic, differential, and geometric topology, and allied
subjects. 
              While it is planned to continue the broad,
interdisciplinary flavor and
              collaboration-friendly format that
have characterized the Festival over the
              years, it is also
proposed to extend the Festival by a day to accommodate
              specific
annual areas of emphasis. In this way the Festival can be
responsive
              to the dominant trends of this era: namely, the
simultaneous flourishing of
              both subspecializations and
cross-disciplinary activity. An active outreach
              program, which
includes some travel support, will be initiated to
              broaden
participation in the Festival. For our initial conference under
this
              grant (May 1-4, 2003), we will have as area of emphasis the
very active field
              of geometric group theory.

The Topology Festival was conceived and initiated
              in the 1960's
both as an annual celebration of the burgeoning field of
              topology
and as an annual conference/workshop for topologists in
              the
northeastern United States.  While topology has deep roots in
early
              European mathematical investigations of space and geometry,
it is in the
              mid-twentieth century that topology came of age,
with American mathematicians
              providing a large array of seminal
discoveries. American topology has been a
              key element in
America's world leadership in mathematics.  Topology is a
              broad
subject, which overlaps with areas of `discrete' mathematics
(e.g.,
              algebra, combinatorics), as well as with `continuous' or
`smooth' mathematics
              (e.g., differential geometry, dynamical
systems, mathematical physics). 
              Indeed, a large part of
contemporary mathematics has been profoundly affected
              by
topological results and methods. As a foundational subject,
              the
applications of topology are very widespread. A few examples
              are:
genetics (the study of knotting of DNA molecules), neuroscience
and
              robotics (dynamical systems modeling), computer science ( in
geometric
              modeling and simulation), mathematical economics (in
smooth equilibrium
              theory), physics (the theory of gauge fields),
and neighboring fields in
              mathematics (e.g., geometric group
theory).  Although many of the basic
              questions that powered early
efforts in topology have been answered, new
              problems are
constantly being generated as science moves forward,
              and
important classical problems remain.  An example of the latter is
the
              Poincare Conjecture, which has been the subject of several
notable talks at
              past Topology Festivals and remains one of the
premier unsolved problems of
              mathematics today---one of the Clay
Institute's seven `millenium problems'---
              and the focus of
intense research. The topologists and geometers at Cornell
              are
proud of the useful role that the Topology Festival has played
and will
              continue to play in the contemporary development of this
dynamic area of
              mathematics.
