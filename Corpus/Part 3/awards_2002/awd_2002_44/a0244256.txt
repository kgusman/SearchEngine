Sampling of a tracer patch released in 2001 in the tropical
              Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea is proposed. The main goals of the sampling
              are to quantify the surprisingly large zonal dispersion of the tracer in the
              tropical Atlantic, and to measure the diapycnal diffusivity of the tracer in
              the pycnocline of the Caribbean, where susceptibility to salt fingering is
              nearly as great as east of Barbados, but where thermohaline staircases are
              rare. Other important goals are to determine the nature of the apparent sinking
              of the tracer distribution in the staircase region east of Barbados, to obtain
              a 2-year measurement of the diapycnal diffusivity there, and to determine the
              westward extent of the tracer patch at 2 years. Exploration of zonal dispersion
              in both the Atlantic and Caribbean will provide unique data with which to
              compare models of ocean circulation, and may help to improve knowledge of shear
              across the subtropical front. Measurement of diapycnal diffusivity in the
              Caribbean will improve parameterizations of mixing as a function of density
              ratio, i.e., as a function of temperature and salinity gradients, in
              salt-finger favorable regions with high shear. The nature of the survey is
              exploratory in all of its goals, and furthermore, the request for support is
              temporally urgent because of the speed with which the tracer patch will spread
              and be swept through the region of the study. Sampling should be done in
              2003.
