              ABSTRACT
CHE-0244960
Winograd/Pennsylvania State

This research project,
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses
              fundamental aspects of the interaction of energetic ions and photons with solid
              surfaces.  The Principal Investigator and his group at the Pennsylvania State
              University are examining the interactions of cluster ion beams with organic
              thin films and with biological samples in an ice matrix.  A combination of
              state resolved experimental measurement with classical trajectory calculational
              modeling, provides information about the deposition of energy in the solid
              surface upon ion-surface collision.  Molecule-specific imaging of the sample
              surface is the goal of this work.  Results from these studies will impact
              analytical mass spectrometry, fusion reactor design, biotechnology, and
              reactive ion etching of electronic materials.  

Surface analysis using high
              energy atomic and cluster ion beams is the focus of the research supported in
              this project.  With the funding of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, Professor Winograd and his coworkers are examining the fundamental
              aspects of ion-solid surface interactions.  The particular focus of this work
              is on the interaction of energetic cluster ions with biological samples in an
              ice matrix, with the goal of developing molecule specific surface analysis of
              biological materials.
