The UAF Experimental Petrology Laboratory is currently
              capable of performing experiments at conditions characteristic of shallow
              crustal magma chambers, to depths of ~20km (at T ~850 degrees C) and
              temperatures to ~1100 degrees C (at P ~200 MPa).   Funds from this grant will
              support the acquisition of a piston-cylinder apparatus that will enable us to
              perform experiments on crust and mantle-relevant compositions at pressures up
              to ~4000 MPa and temperatures to ~2000 degrees C.  Currently, many researchers
              rely upon this type of apparatus to address important questions relevant to
              understanding volcanic and tectonic processes, such as melt generation in the
              mantle at subduction zones and mid-oceanic ridges, cation and anion diffusion
              rates and element partitioning between minerals and melts, phase equilibria of
              important deep crustal and mantle minerals, and studies on materials
              appropriate for other planetary environments.  The acquisition of the
              piston-cylinder apparatus will serve an important purpose in extending the
              range of experiments possible on existing NSF supported projects within the
              volcanology group at the UAF Geophysical Institute.  In addition, it will open
              the door for those interested in other aspects of high-pressure research on
              crustal and mantle rocks relevant to the Earth, as well as other planetary
              systems.
