Abstract    :
              Previous power and energy research has focused almost exculsive on
              battery-operated devices.  In contrast, this research is focused is focused on
              power and energy prediction and conservation for clusters of servers.

The
              main goals of the research are: (1) to develop a methodology and a tool that
              combine analytical modeling, experimentation, and optimization algorithms to
              predict the power/energy conservation techniques server clusters; (2) to
              develop power/energy conservation techniques that can use the prediction
              infrastructure to optimize consumption for both curren and future server
              cluster without excessive performance degradingl and (3) to design, implement,
              and evaluate cluster systems that exploit these techniques.

This research
              will allow server cluster to be engineered to a specific and low consumption. 
              Furthermore, it allow conservation techniques to make fundamental tradeoff
              decisions about power, energy, and performance.  These developments will have
              important implications, given that the computational model upon which the
              Internet is oragnized relies on large server clusters.
