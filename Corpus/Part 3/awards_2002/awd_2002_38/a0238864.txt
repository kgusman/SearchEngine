Abstract    :
              The use of protein therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of diseases
              including cancer and AIDS is a rapidly expanding industry. One of the major
              hurdles in the development of a protein therapeutic is production of the
              recombinant protein at a level that can meet demand in an economically feasible
              manner. Present methods for the optimization of protein secretion strains
              involve either random mutagenesis of a host strain followed by laborious
              screening or ad hoc cellular manipulation. In this proposal, a novel
              technological platform for protein production optimization will be developed.
              Yeast genetics will be combined with yeast surface display technology to
              engineer cells for increased production of a model therapeutic protein. Yeast
              surface display will provide a quantitative assessment of protein expression
              level on a single cell basis and make the rapid screening of combinatorial
              libraries of yeast variants possible. A yeast gene overexpression library and
              gene disruption library will be screened for yeast cells having increased
              protein expression using flow cytometry. The functional roles of yeast cellular
              proteins extracted in these screens will be investigated by subcellular
              localization studies and by yeast two-hybrid analyses. In coordination with the
              research objectives, a composite classroom and laboratory course will be
              developed and implemented to introduce molecular and cellular level design
              strategies. This course sequence will train undergraduate and graduate students
              in modern combinatorial methods for the engineering design of RNA, DNA,
              proteins, and cells.
