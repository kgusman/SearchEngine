Abstract    :
              0238721   Morrison   Dr. Morrison's career goal is to promote best practices in
              engineering, science and education by integrating novel air pollution research
              with undergraduate coursework.  His goals are achieved by:  applying best
              education practices to increase and improve student learning given limited
              in-class contact time,  integrating research and course work through projects
              that introduce college, high school and non-traditional students to high-level
              experimental research while allowing students to generate publishable data, and
               probing the physics and chemistry of indoor air pollution, a poorly studied
              area of air quality research.
Building on efforts to bring research to high
              school students, the PI is continuing to actively apply improved teaching
              practices. Specifically, Dr. Morrison has been selected to participate in the
              competitive "New Faculty Teaching Scholars" program of the University of
              Missouri system. This program seeks to improve student learning by challenging
              new teachers to incorporate the most successful teaching techniques in the
              classroom and coursework. 
Dr. Morrison has been active in indoor air
              pollution research for nearly eight years and, more recently, in developing new
              techniques for environmental analysis.   In indoor environments, ozone reacts
              with surfaces, liberating volatile oxidized products into indoor air that are
              odorous, irritating and may reduce personal comfort and productivity, and even
              contribute to "Sick Building Syndrome". 
This project is well suited to the
              goal of acquainting students with research while improving our understanding of
              indoor pollution and exposure. 
Broader impact: Project results will influence
              product decision-making of manufacturers, while making recommendations to
              consumers regarding product usage, and providing public health officials with a
              database of emissions measurements and exposure estimates for use in
              recommending policy.
