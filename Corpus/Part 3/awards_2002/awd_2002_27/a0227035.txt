Abstract    :
              This targeted Math and Science Partnership includes the Duke University Pratt
              School of Engineering, four school districts (Alamance/Burlington Schools,
              Orange County Schools, Iredell/Statesville Schools, Harnett County Schools),
              the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, and the North Carolina
              Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Center.  Focusing on  K-8
              science education, Teachers and Scientists Collaborating (TASC) is providing
              curriculum units selected from an array of inquiry-based curricula, inservice
              professional development, and support from Duke University scientists. 
              Objectives include establishing a cadre of scientists who provide ongoing
              teacher assistance in science content that is aligned with state/national
              standards, instituting a professional development system to prepare teachers to
              use inquiry-based instructional modules and to benefit from scientist
              resources, creating a fee-based lending library of inquiry-based modules
              available to teachers, and institutionalizing science education support.  TASC
              seeks to  narrow achievement gaps, improve end-of grade science and mathematics
              scores, and to improve the quality of science teaching in participating school
              systems by increasing content knowledge, the use of inquiry-based teaching
              techniques, and the engagement of scientists in assisting teachers in
              implementing science standards. The project is expected to serve 7,560 teachers
              and 352,800 students.
