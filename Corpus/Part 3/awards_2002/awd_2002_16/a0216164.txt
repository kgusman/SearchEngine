This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Hawaii at Manoa provides funds for development of a cabled oceanographic
              observatory, at the location of the existing Hawaii Ocean Timeseries (HOT)
              Station ALOHA, to be known as the ANZCAN-ALOHA Ocean Observatory.  The goal of
              the project is to provide power and data communication capability over the
              abandoned ANZCAN telecommunications cable, which will be moved 26 kilometers to
              the existing site of the 13-year ALOHA time series.  The cable comes ashore on
              Oahu, and it will be managed from University of Hawaii's Manoa campus.  It will
              enable a major increase in experimental capability at and near the site, with a
              kilowatt of power and 2 mbaud data rate available to support instruments and
              ocean experiments in physical, chemical, biological and geological oceanography
              as well as meteorology, ocean optics, biogeochemistry and other fields.  A
              moored profiler will provide continuous monitoring of the physical properties
              of the full water column, with operator control to respond to ocean events.  An
              acoustic modem capability will be included to allow deployment and
              communication with experiments that are not physically attached to the cabled
              junction box.  The cabled observatory will have Internet connectivity, allowing
              researchers to observe and control their experiments, and providing links to
              the observatory and to related educational sites for students at levels from
              grade school to graduate school. University of Hawaii will provide cost-share
              support equal to more than 30% of equipment costs, per MRI Program guidelines
              for development proposals undertaken at Ph.D.-granting institutions.
