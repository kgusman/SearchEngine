Pollen tubes deliver sperm to the ovules via a
              process known as tip growth. Large amounts of plasma membrane and cell wall
              precursors, synthesized in the Golgi, are transported to the tip where they
              undergo the polymerization and cross-linking reactions characteristic of tip
              growth. This proposal describes a pollen-specific protein, CBP25/22, that was
              isolated by a functional interaction with calmodulin (CaM), the major Ca
              2+-sensing protein in cells.  CBP25/22 is located on the exterior face of an
              abundant class of pollen organelles and has oxalate oxidase (OxO) activity, a
              reaction that generates peroxide (H2O2).  Based on these unique biochemical
              properties, we propose that the CBP25/22 OxO-generated H2O2 mediates
              cross-linking of wall proteins and polymers in growing pollen tubes.  Moreover,
              given the pivotal role of tip Ca2+ gradients in pollen tube growth, we propose
              that the Ca 2+-sensitive binding of CaM to CBP25/22 confines expression of the
              OxO activity to the growing tip. The focus of this research is to demonstrate
              that the unique biochemical properties of CBP25/22 identified in vitro, are
              expressed within the growing pollen tube. The proposed experimental plan will
              use immunological, biochemical and protein-protein interaction techniques to
              localize the CBP25/22 and CaM proteins and the enzymatic product (H2O2 ) in
              situ . Specifically we will demonstrate a Ca 2+ -sensitive association of
              CBP25/22 and CaM in vivo and show that OxO-generated H2O2 co-localizes with the
              CBP25/22 protein in vivo. 

This research may provide a novel way to control
              pollination, thus alleviating the current concern about gene flow via pollen
              from transgenic crops.  In addition it may have a broader impact on basic
              growth mechanisms; neurons and fungal hypha also exhibit tip growth. 
              Significantly, CBP25/22 shares its unique CaM-binding characteristics with
              neuromodulin, a protein that functions in vesicle transport and fusion in the
              tip of extending neurons.  This similarity suggests that there may be a common
              mechanism underlying tip growth in diverse organisms.
