 The relationship between social status and the allocation of
              societal benefits is a major research concern in Sociology.  The PIs will
              conduct research that is at the intersection of two social psychological
              theories-Network Exchange Theory and status Characteristics and Expectations
              States theory-that have independently evolved over the last 25 years.  The
              research investigates how status characteristics (such as age and education)
              affect the distribution of power in exchange relations.    Specifically, the
              PIs seek to answer two fundamental questions regarding status in social
              exchange relation.  First, does "performance expectations" (generalized
              anticipations regarding the abilities for one's self and partner) produced by
              age and education differences generate power for higher status actors?  Second,
              is the purchasing power of money, as a commodity of exchange, is altered by the
              status of the buyer and/or seller?  The PIs posit that status characteristics
              induce power by altering the "status value" of exchangeable good and/or the
              "performance expectations" actors hold for one another. The investigators will
              conduct a series of exchange experiments, in which college students bargain
              with one another via computers located in separate rooms.  Status information
              regarding the partner is systematically manipulated and observations recorded
              on how this information alters the outcome of the negotiations.  More
              generally, this research expands our knowledge regarding how status information
              alters how power is exercised.
