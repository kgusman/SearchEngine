Abstract    :
              	This collaborative proposal would use establishment data from EEO reports to
              investigate changes in occupational segregation across nine broad occupational
              categories between 1966 and 1999.  Preliminary analyses have documented the
              national declines in average within-establishment segregation by gender and
              racial/ethnic group across the 34 years of data.   Average segregation by
              county and industry will be made available as a public use data file.  The
              levels of and changes in establishment-level segregation will be analyzed to
              estimate the effects of factors at the establishment level (e.g., years since
              founding), the firm level (e.g., federal reporting requirements), the industry
              level (e.g., market competition), and the local area (e.g., minority
              concentrations and women's labor force participation).
