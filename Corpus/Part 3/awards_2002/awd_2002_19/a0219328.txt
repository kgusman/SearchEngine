Abstract    :
              This award is the result of a proposal submitted to the Information Technology
              Research (ITR) initiative.  The research will be done in collaboration with Los
              Alamos National Laboratory.  

A long-standing obstacle to the understanding
              of condensed phase systems is that many important processes occur on a
              time-scale that is not easily accessible with conventional simulation methods. 
              For example, molecular dynamics is generally limited to nanoseconds because of
              the small time-step required for the integration of the equations of motion. 
              However, relevant processes that are activated, i.e., infrequent events, often
              take place on a time-scale of microseconds or even longer.  Examples include
              the evolution of the surface morphology during crystal or film growth, the
              diffusion of point defects in solids, and the migration of grain boundaries
              during plastic strain.

Recently, a variety of accelerated dynamics
              techniques, including hyperdynamics, parallel replica dynamics, and
              temperature-accelerated dynamics have been proposed in order to speed up the
              simulation of infrequent events in molecular dynamics.  In particular,
              temperature-accelerated dynamics has been quite successful in extending the
              time-scales for simulations since it allows realistic simulations
              oflow-temperature processes over time-scales as long as seconds and even hours.
               However, due to the fact that the computational work required scales as the
              square or even as the cube of the number of atoms N, this technique can only be
              applied to extremely small systems.  As a result, realistic simulations of
              materials over both extended time and extended length scales have not been
              possible.

The research here will use parallel computations in order to
              extend accelerated dynamics so that both large system sizes and long
              time-scales can be simulated simultaneously.  The development of such a
              capability to simulate both mesoscopic systems sizes and long time-scales
              should present a major breakthrough in our ability to carry out realistic
              atomic simulations.

In parallel with this effort, sparse-computational
              algorithms will be developed in order to reduce the exponent corresponding to
              the dependence of the computational work on the system size in accelerated
              dynamics.  The development of such algorithms is based on the realization that
              eliminating non-local moves or groups of non-local moves from the force
              calculations involved in these methods during the search for saddle-points
              should significantly reduce the dependence of the computational work required
              on the cluster size N.  Parallel replica dynamics will also be used in both
              techniques to extend the time-scales of the simulations.

As a first specific
              application of spatially parallel accelerated dynamics we will focus on
              simulations of metal-on-metal epitaxial growth at low temperature using
              temperature-accelerated dynamics.  This is a problem of great interest due to
              the observation of a variety of unexplained phenomena including nanoscale
              facetting and strain-induced mound regularization at low tempertures. The
              methods developed here should be applicable to a much broader range of systems
              as well.
