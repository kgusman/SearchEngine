"Spreading Kinetics of Constrained
              Thin Films"

The rate at which a liquid spreads over a solid surface is
              called the wetting kinetics, which deals with the rates at which a liquid moves
              over a solid surface and displaces a second fluid.   Since the liquid film
              thickness gradually decreases to zero as the contact line, the line common to
              the solid-liquid-vapor phases, is approached, the special properties of thin
              liquid films play an important role.  Of importance here is the disjoining
              pressure, which is related to the excess potential in thin films (less than 100
              nanometers), and can be used as a body force to describe the hydrodynamics and
              equilibrium.  This analytical research is for a liquid that has both attraction
              and repulsion for the solid substrate in its disjoining pressure, which is
              common but has not been analyzed. Although the thin film phenomenon determines
              that the liquid is non-wetting, the dynamics of spreading itself seems
              unaffected in the experiments by the disjoining 
pressure until the time when
              the moving liquid suddenly equilibrates.  A quantitative 
description of how
              such a behavior arises will be made clear from the results of this research. 
              The fluid mechanical equations for the profile of the moving liquid film will
              be solved numerically.  The numerical method is made very difficult by the need
              to look at two very different length scales, the scale of the basic liquid mass
              and the thin film dimensions, and over very long times.  Additionally, the
              effect of liquid evaporation and surface roughness will be considered, since
              they bring in great deal of reality to the analysis.
