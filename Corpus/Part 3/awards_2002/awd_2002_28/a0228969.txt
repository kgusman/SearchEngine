Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Studies in Ceramics in the summer
              of 2002  will focus the effect of length scale of the microstructure on
              processing, characterization and properties of ceramics.  This subject lies at
              the heart of our emerging ability to design ceramic materials with specific
              microstructures and properties.  Recent research activities among ceramists and
              the growing number of publications in this area indicate that a meeting on this
              topic is especially timely.  Key researchers in the field have committed to
              attend this meeting and describe their most recent findings (please see
              http://www.grc.uri.edu/programs/2002/ceramics.htm for the program).  To augment
              the traditional technical presentations, additional program initiatives, namely
              an invited poster session for young scientists and enhanced participation of
              graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.  The conference will gather
              scholars and educators at all career levels in an atmosphere conducive not only
              to making technical progress, but also for establishing sustainable
              collaborations and professional relationships.  The meeting setting and
              atmosphere provides ample time for discussions and networking.
 
This
              conference has significant broad impact for the ceramics community through the
              identification of key research areas, establishment of new collaborations,
              reinforcement of existing connections, and encouragement of a young and diverse
              group of professionals.  The NSF funding will be used to encourage the
              participation of graduate students, post doctoral associates and other young
              scientists and engineers at the start of their professional careers.
