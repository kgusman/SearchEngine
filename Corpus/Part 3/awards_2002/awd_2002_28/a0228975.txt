This project will examine the crystal structure,
              pressure-temperature stability, and thermochemical properties of several
              members of a new class of silicate minerals known as the triple-chain
              silicates.  Research will begin with the most readily made triple-chain
              silicate, Na4Mg8Si12O32(OH)4 = Na-Cjt, which is the sodium-bearing analogue of
              the naturally occurring mineral clino-jimthompsonite.   The experimental
              investigation of the pressure-temperature stability of Na-Cjt breaking down to
              a Na-Mg-bearing double chain silicate (amphibole) will provide a valuable
              foundation for studying other triple-chain silicates.  An important aspect of
              this study is the measurement of the third-law entropy and enthalpy of
              formation of Na-Cjt, which will be made in the labs operated by Prof. J.
              Boerio-Goates at Brigham Young University and by Prof. A. Navrotsky at the
              University of California, Davis, respectively.  The thermodynamic properties of
              Ca-clinojimthompsonite (Ca2Mg8Si12O32(OH)4) will be determined, to a first
              approximation, by experimentally investigating the shift of the Na-Cjt
              stability curve as Ca is added to both the triple- and double-chain phases and
              using simple ideal-activity expressions to estimate the activities of the
              end-member phases.  The broader scientific contribution of this study is that
              it is the first attempt to provide experimental and calorimetric data for a
              class of silicate minerals that is becoming increasingly recognized in nature
              but for which there is no solid information on their
              pressure-temperature-composition field of stability.  This study may also draw
              attention of Earth scientists to the role that Na-Cjt may play in storing Na in
              the oceanic lithosphere.
