Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is intended to
              demonstrate the fabrication of multiple, unconventionally small diameter, and
              foundry incompatible wafers on a single, large-area 8-inch substrate. The
              success of this effort will bring the benefits offered by devices made from
              such wafers to the global community at affordable cost. The superior
              thermo-mechanical properties of silicon carbide have made it a material of
              choice for use as sensors in harsh environments. However, the lack of profit
              incentive due to high substrate cost, small diameter (implying high production
              cost per unit volume), and high capital equipment cost have combined to inhibit
              industry interest in its global commercialization. A recently patented wafer
              platform technology offers four immediate crucial benefits: 1) It significantly
              reduces the high production cost by an order of magnitude to make silicon
              carbide based sensors economically viable and competitive; 2) It utilizes
              semiconductor-on-insulator technology to improve silicon carbide sensor
              functionality at 600oC over pn-junction based silicon carbide sensors, which
              suffer from leakage current as it approaches 500C; 3) A large-area (8-inch)
              platform technology will significantly increase industry confidence toward
              global commercialization; and 4) It opens a new technology growth path toward
              integrated micro-systems packaging.

Potential commercial applications a wide
              variety of electronic and opto-electronic sensors. The domestic sensors and
              instrumentation market in 2000 was $49 billion at an annual growth rate of
              13.5%, Worldwide Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMs) market was $14.2
              billion, expected to reach $30.4 billion with at a Compounded Annual Growth
              Rate (CAGR) of 21% in 2004, of which the Silicon Carbide MEMs; worldwide market
              is expected to reach $6 billion by 2005 (Sensors magazine, July 2001).
