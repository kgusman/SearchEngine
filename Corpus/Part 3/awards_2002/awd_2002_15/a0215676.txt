Abstract    :
              A unique professional consortium called the Asian-Pacific Network of Centers for
              Earthquake Engineering Research (ANCER) was established in 2001 in Seoul, Korea
              by 7 existing national earthquake engineering research centers. The vision of
              ANCER is to broaden the research and development impact and mitigation
              practices through cooperative activities that can be best advanced on a
              center-to-center basis over a large geographical area. ANCER will sponsor, for
              the first time of this kind, the International Conference on Advances and New
              Challenges in Earthquake Engineering Research in August 15-20, 2002. The
              Conference will consist of two consecutive back-to-back meetings in Harbin and
              Hong Kong, China. The common underpinning of both meetings is the application
              of advanced technologies and new design philosophies/methodologies to address
              recent challenges in earthquake engineering and hazard mitigation. This forward
              looking intellectual exercise will involve multiple agencies and major
              universities from the Asia-Pacific region, bringing together leading
              researchers in the field to develop a clear picture of the current status in
              the field, as well as to examine new opportunities on the basis of Asia-Pacific
              regional and global cooperation. This project provides the funds to allow a
              delegation of US researchers to participate in this important Conference.
