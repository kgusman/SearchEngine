Abstract    :
              This award provides support to establish a COSEE Center in California with three
              distributed complementary partners:    the Lawrence Hall of Science on the
              campus of  the University of California at Berkeley (informal science partner),
              Scripps Institution-University of California San Diego (research partner) and
              Monterey Peninsula College (a public community college and formal education
              partner) in Monterey.   The activities of the proposed COSEE will be organized
              around four primary initiatives:    1) an outreach effort based at Scripps to
              engage ocean scientists in K-14 education and the interpretation of their
              research, 2) the development of an undergraduate course Communicating Ocean
              Science designed to increase the involvement of undergraduates, graduate
              students and scientists in educational outreach, 3) the development of an Ocean
              Careers web site and 4) developing and testing an Ocean Immersion Site for K-12
              education based at Scripps to serve the large and culturally diverse population
              of the San Diego area.  

The work of this COSEE will enhance the integration
              of research and education in California by linking some of the best ocean
              science researchers in the world to science education in both formal and
              informal settings.    The California COSEE's focus on working with schools and
              school districts in the diverse San Diego area will provide additional
              resources to strengthen science education and increase access to knowledge and
              careers among underrepresented populations. Several of the initiatives in this
              proposal will add diversity and balance to the mosaic of approaches and
              activities to be implemented by the COSEE network.    In particular, the
              extension model is a unique 'user-centered' approach to getting more scientists
              involved that clearly needs to be developed and its effectiveness assessed.   
              The undergraduate course in communicating science has potential as a
              professional development vehicle for college faculty, graduate students and
              undergraduate majors; this component is being co-funded by NSF's Division of
              Undergraduate Education. The DUE's Advanced Technology Education program is
              also providing co-funding for the Careers website at Monterey Peninsula
              College.
