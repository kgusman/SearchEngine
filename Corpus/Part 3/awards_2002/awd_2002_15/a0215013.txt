Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project proposes to
              develop  a geminivirus-derived gene expression system, based on cabbage leaf
              curl virus, to test the effect of agronomically important genes in a transient,
              high throughput model. While the genomics revolution is a major step
              toward
understanding gene function, the foremost challenge is correlating
              bioinformatics data with actual
functional responses. Paradigm Genetics, Inc.,
              currently uses the plant model species, Arbidopsis thaliana in a pipeline
              developed specifically to address the bottleneck between sequence and
              functional data. Arabidopsis plants genetically engineered to over or
              underexpress single genes are analyzed in developmental, biochemical and
              molecular platforms. While this pipeline has been successful in many ways, two
              disadvantages remain : (1) the amount of time required to generate stable
              Arabidopsis transformants, and (2) the ability to test only one gene at a time.
              To address these issues, this proposal initiates the development of an
              additional platform using geminivirus vectors. First, a genetic screen of
              Arabidopsis ecotypes and a mutagenized population will be carried out. This
              screen is designed to isolate symptomless Arabidopsis lines supporting viral
              replication and spread. Second, based on the hypothesis that lower viral levels
              can decrease symptom development in the plant, the viral vector will be
              modified to replicate at lower levels. Results from this research will be  used
              to start a high throughput assay to determine functions of agronomically
              important genes. Additionally, these results will lead to important agronomic
              understandings of virus/host interactions.

The commercial applications of
              this project are in crop plant improvement.
