Abstract    :
              In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This
              project will design a new observation protocol for use at GLOBE schools in
              order to detect annual changes in migration of the ruby throated hummingbird
              (Archilocus colubris), the widest ranging hummingbird commonly observed in 38
              Eastern U.S. states and 7 Canadian provinces, and in their wintering grounds in
              Mexico and Central America. Little is known about the drivers for migration,
              nesting and re-nesting activity, primarily because a systematic set of
              observations across the species range is absent, and because recapture of
              banded specimens is exceedingly rare. Trends in current data cannot be
              attributed to actual changes in the population because they simply may be due
              to an increased amount of reporting. This observation-only program will gather
              data on first appearance, flower species visited, sex and/or age, and duration
              of feeding at participating schools. These observations will be taken in
              concert with other GLOBE measurements of atmospheric condition and phenology,
              giving the potential for correlating the humming bird's behavior with
              environmental factors such as time of year, location, and weather.
