Abstract    :
              Large pools of soil C have accumulated in high latitude ecosystems since
              glaciation as soil organic matter was climatically protected from decomposition
              by low temperatures and frozen soil. Air temperatures have been observed to
              increase at high latitudes over the last 25 years, and this "old" stored soil C
              may be susceptible to decomposition as soils thaw. Sustained and significant
              transfers of C to the atmosphere that could cause a positive feedback to
              climate change must come from stored soil C, which forms the bulk of the soil
              pool in these ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the sources of carbon
              respiration is critical to predicting the response of C cycling to climate
              change. The proposed research uses radiocarbon and stable isotope measurements
              of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil respiration to characterize the sources
              of soil C released following soil thaw. Organic and mineral soil cores
              collected from acidic and non-acidic tussock tundra sites at the Toolik Lake
              Long Term Ecological Research station will be studied to determine the
              potential of arctic soils to release old C as permafrost melts. This
              information is critical for predicting C loss from high latitude ecosystems to
              the atmosphere as a result of global change.
