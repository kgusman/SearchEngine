Title: Singularities and Statistics in Nonlinear
              Partial Differential Equations

A first goal of this proposal is to study
              mathematically singularities in fluids and plasmas, and their connection to
              physical processes.  Specific problems include free surface pinch-off in
              fluids, geometric depletion of singularities in active scalars, incompressible
              Euler and MHD equations related to vortex and magnetic reconnection.  A second
              goal of the proposal is to study statistics of long time behavior of
              dissipative systems, such as thermal fluid convection. Specific goals include
              bounds on heat transport in convection, energy cascades, coarse inertial
              manifolds, and turbulent front propagation.

Fluids and plasmas involve many
              active length and time scales that interact dynamically. The long time behavior
              of complex systems, such as turbulent convection, involves also  many
              interacting spatial and temporal scales. Mathematical studies are needed to
              guide computer simulations. What quantities are well behaved, and can be safely
              predicted with rather inexpensive, coarse computations? What conditions produce
              rapid generation of small scales? Which of these are important and result in
              qualitative changes? What are the characteristics of the ensuing dissipative
              energy transfer? These are fundamental questions for progress in understanding
              and computation of complex phenomena. This proposal is aimed at a core of such
              questions.
