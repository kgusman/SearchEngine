The International Research Fellowship Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month
              research fellowship by Dr. Sandra J. Shefelbine to work with Dr. Lutz Claes at
              the University of Ulm's Institute of Orthopaedic Research and Biomechanics, in
              Germany.
The purpose of this project is to combine Quantitative computer
              tomography (QCT) and Finite element analysis of a fracture callus in a rat
              femur in order to predict bone stiffness during fracture healing.  This will be
              done by: the development of a model of fracture healing in the rat femur;
              imaging the healing fracture using micro computer tomography (CT); creating a
              finite element model of the healing fracture to predict bone strength and;
              validating the finite element predictions with mechanical testing of the bones
              in bending and torsion.  The combination of QCT and finite element modeling in
              determining the bone strength in fracture healing will be a powerful technique
              for determining detailed, quantitative information during the healing
              process.

The Institute is a well-known lab for experimental biomechanics. 
              Dr. Claes' lab focuses on the effects of mechanics on fracture healing and has
              a wide range of experimental facilities.
