The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research
              fellowship by Dr. Susana Gonzalo to work with Dr. Manuel Serrano at the
              National Center of Biotechnology in Madrid, Spain.

For this project, the PI
              will identify the cis-activity promoter elements of the INK4a/ARF locus that
              are responsive to the transcriptional repressor Bmi-1, and then identify the
              transacting transcription factors that mediate Bmi-1 repression of this gene. 
              The INK4a/ARF locus encodes two proteins (p16in4a/ARF) that are important for
              two different tumor suppressor pathways in mammalian cells.  The expression of
              both of these proteins is repressed during normal cell growth, but becomes
              elevated in response to oncogenic stresses to prevent the proliferation and
              survival of cells in which an oncogene has become activated.  This study is
              critical to understand the control mechanisms that cells use to fight
              cancer.

Dr. Serrano is an authority in the fields of cell-cycle and tumor
              suppression.  His lab has critical tools necessary to develop this project.
