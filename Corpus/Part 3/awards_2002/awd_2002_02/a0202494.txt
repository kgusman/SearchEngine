ABSTRACT

Research
              will be conducted on several projects on the theory
of Dynamical Systems, and
              more specifically, in Holomorphic
Dynamics and Small Divisor theory. Using
              heuristic ideas from
Holomorphic Dynamics it is proposed to investigate an
              effective
selection of polynomials as iterators in Pollard rho method of
              
factorization. Factorization algorithms are a central topic
in Cryptography.
              Numerical explorations show that there is
room for improvement in this field.
              In Holomorphic Dynamics
and Small Divisors, it is proposed to extend the 
              general
theory of dynamics on Hedgehogs. The focus of the proposed
research
              is on weak forms of stability when arithmetic
conditions, typical of Small
              Divisors, fail. It is proposed to 
investigate Siegel disks and their
              boundary, and to attack
the hard problem of classifying invariant annular
              continua.
It is anticipated that the techniques of tube-log Riemann
surfaces
              should play an important role. Another project
consists in extending geometric
              techniques to higher
dimensional Small Divisors problems. In particular, a
              new
geometric construction of invariant tori is envisioned. In
the theory of
              Renormalization in Holomorphic  Dynamics it
is proposed to develop the new
              theory of renormalization.
This involves a better understanding of
              Degenerate
Quasi-Conformal theory (i.e. for non bounded
              Beltrami
coefficients). A last topic in Complex Analysis on which
research is
              proposed is the theory of Borel Monogenic 
functions. We project to develop a
              theory that is flexible
enough to apply to problems in Small
              Divisors.



Dynamical Systems is a branch of Mathematics with
              ancient
roots linked to Celestial Mechanics. It was founded as a
distinct
              branch of Mathematics more than a century ago by
H. Poincare. It is a rich
              field with multiple interactions
with other parts of Mathematics and Science.
              The main goal
is the study of the long time behavior of evolution
              processes.
Some of the most important problems come from fields as
Biology,
              Physical Sciences and Chemistry. One of the central 
questions is the Problem
              of Stability. For example, is the
Solar System stable  according to Newton
              laws ? K.A.M. theory
(also called  Small Divisor theory) is one of the
              major
branches in Dynamical Systems. It was founded in the second
half of the
              XXth century and had an important impact in
Dynamical Systems and related
              fields. It is the very first
theory that provides stability results in
              non-linear
conservative problems. It continues its expansion to fields
as
              diverse as Partial Differential Equations, the theory 
of foliations,
              Holomorphic Dynamics, etc. In the proposed
projects some of the most difficult
              open questions in KAM
theory will be explored. What happens when stability
              fails?
Can we still recover some traces of stability that may be
useful in
              the applications?
