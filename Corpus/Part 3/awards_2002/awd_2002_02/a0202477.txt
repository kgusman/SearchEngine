              ABSTRACT DMS - 0202477.

Jeff A. Viaclovsky's project has three parts. 
The
              first part is joint work with Gang Tian, 
dealing with orbifold compactness of
              Bach flat 
metrics in dimension 4. The second part is joint work 
with Matt
              Gursky, and is about curvature functionals and 
conformal deformation of
              curvatures in dimension 3. 
The third part deals with existence of solutions
              
to some fully nonlinear equations in conformal geometry.  
The first project
              is to understand compactness properties 
of the moduli space of critical
              points of the L2 norm 
of the Weyl tensor in 4 dimensions. The Euler-Lagrange
              
equations are known as the Bach equations, and there are 
many known
              solutions, for example, metrics that are locally 
conformally Einsten, and
              self-dual or anti-self-dual 
metrics. Since it is known that these metrics
              exist in 
abundance, it is an interesting problem to understand 
the moduli
              space of solutions. The project of Viaclovsky 
and Tian is to show that, with
              certain geometric 
conditions, one may compactify this space by adding
              
metrics with orbifold singularities. The other parts 
of the project deal
              with fully nonlinear equations in
conformal geometry. The goal is to
              conformally deform a 
metric so that the kth elementary symmetric function of
              the 
eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor is constant. This may 
be viewed as a
              fully nonlinear generalization of the 
well-known Yamabe problem. An
              application of this is to 
improve the curvature by conformal deformation. For
              
example, given an initial metric, conditions are found so 
that the metric
              can be conformally deformed to positive 
sectional curvature. 

The project
              with Tian generalizes some well-known 
results for Einstein metrics. Einstein
              metrics are 
particularly interesting from the connection with Eisteins's
              
theory of general relativity, and the Bach equations 
are a natural higher
              order generalization 
of the Einstein equation. The work in conformal
              
geometry is naturally conformally invariant 
and also has applications in
              physics through 
conformal field theory. Firthermore, new notions of mass
              
arise for these equations, and this is also 
of interest in general
              relativity. These equations 
also have applications to determining the
              topology 
of 3-manifolds, given some geometric constraint 
on the curvature.
