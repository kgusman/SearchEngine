This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs, allows a
              US investigator to join a marine geological research cruise (the CARBONANT
              project) sponsored by the Italian National Antarctic Research Program and to
              begin a new collaborative research project with Italian scientists. The project
              is to study Quaternary to recent biogenic carbonate production and
              sedimentation in the Ross Sea. Sediment facies enriched in biogenic carbonate
              are known from several portions of the Ross Sea continental shelf and slope,
              however, the content and distribution of these facies are incompletely known.
              In addition, the accumulation rates for these facies have never been
              documented. Shipboard work will provide an initial assessment of carbonate
              preservation and faunal content. Marine biogenic carbonates (e.g. mollusc
              shells, foraminifera) are important vectors for paleoclimatic and
              geochronologic information. Collections made during this cruise are intended
              for use as baseline for Ross Sea biogenic carbonate stable isotope and
              geochronologic data. Following the shipboard work, samples will be analyzed in
              the Amino Acid Dating Laboratory at INSTAAR at the University of Colorado. This
              lab will perform amino acid analysis on carbonate shelly fossils isolated from
              sediment samples collected on the CARBONANT cruise. Amino acid analysis is a
              useful geochronologic tool that has received only limited use in previous
              Antarctic geologic studies. This analytical method can discern fossil ages
              between modern and 5 million years before present. Amino acid analysis is best
              applied to biogenic carbonate (e.g. mollusc shells). Paired geochronologic
              analyses will be performed on single shell specimens including AMS radiocarbon
              and amino acid analysis. The use of paired analyses will enable calibration of
              amino acid racemization rates in Ross Sea sediments and an initial assessment
              of Ross Sea bottom water temperatures. The data collected through this project
              will be interpreted jointly with Italian researchers.
