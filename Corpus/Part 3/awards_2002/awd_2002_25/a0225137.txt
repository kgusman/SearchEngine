Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for renovation of small research/teaching
              laboratories at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL).  The
              Laboratory has a history of accommodating NSF-funded research and training
              programs, but is increasingly limited by the deteriorating quality and poor
              insulation of its older buildings.  The three aging laboratories to be improved
              have been in service since 1929 (Kidney Shed), 1938 (Halsey Laboratory) and
              1963 (Rappaport Laboratory). The planned improvements and renovations include
              restoration of exterior surfaces and roofing, improved insulation, replacement
              of bench tops, cabinetry, plumbing and installation of seamless flooring. These
              renovations will maintain the informal seaside appearance of the buildings. 
              MDIBL provides facilities for visiting investigators who use marine species for
              investigating the mechanisms of basic biological processes such as
              osmoregulation, reproduction and cell division, and offers educational programs
              for students at all levels from high school through postdoctoral. The recent
              initiation of the Center for Marine Functional Genomic Studies at MDIBL, which
              includes modern genomics and bioinformatics capabilities, has increased the
              demand for laboratory space and made the planned improvements a high priority
              for the Laboratory.
