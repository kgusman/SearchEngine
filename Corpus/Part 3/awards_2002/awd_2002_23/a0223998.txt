This planning grant provides support for a series of three
              workshops that will bring together technological, scientific, educational and
              management experts to develop a plan for the use and application of remote
              sensing and real-time monitoring technologies for research and management of
              rivers and estuaries.  These workshops will be organized in partnership with
              the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute and they will serve as a companion to a demonstration
              project, sponsored by the Rivers and Estuaries Center on the Hudson River, that
              will use a selected area of the Hudson estuary as a test site for real-time
              monitoring of physical, chemical and biological river parameters.  The parallel
              tracks of these two projects will allow workshop participants to avail
              themselves of an operating "river laboratory" and will allow the demonstration
              project to utilize the guidance and expertise of the workshop participants. 
              The workshop and demonstration projects will integrate their findings to
              support a proposal that will seek to use the 154 mile Hudson River estuary as
              the model for the deployment of a remote sensing array that will utilize novel
              miniaturized sensor technology, robotics and existing monitoring stations to
              produce a continuous stream of river data transmitted by an advanced
              high-bandwidth, real-time communications system integrated with satellite
              remote-sensing imagery.  The specific objectives of the workshops will be to
              (1) understand the status of other efforts to wire the earth and the biosphere,
              (2) identify the technological requirements and management and educational
              applications for the unique setting of rivers and estuaries and (3) develop a
              plan for an integrated in-situ and watershed-wide  instrumentation of rivers
              and estuaries.
