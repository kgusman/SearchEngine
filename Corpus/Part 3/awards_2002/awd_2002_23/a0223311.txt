              Abstract
We have recently generated a long record of atmospheric  between 11-45
              ka BP using coupled AMS  14C and TIMS U/Th and U/Pa dating of a stalagmite
              recovered from a cave in the Bahamas (Beck et al.,2001;Richards et al., in
              Press).This record reveals highly elevated 14 C during the last glacial period,
              especially between 45 and 33 ka BP.
Superimposed on this broad peak of  14 C
              are numerous rapid excursions, the largest of which occurs between 44.3 and
              43.3 ka. While some of the structure revealed in this record is clearly linked
              to variations in the terrestrial magnetic field, other structures appear to be
              correlated with Dansgaard/Oeschger variations revealed in the GISP2  18O
              record, or linked to Heinrich events H1-H5.Carbon cycle box models suggest that
              the major features of this record cannot be produced with solar or terrestrial
              magnetic field modulation alone, but also require significant fluctuations in
              the global carbon cycle as well. In this proposal, we plan to validate this
              existing atmospheric 14 C record by generating additional speleothem D14C
              records, and to further explore the causes of the observed fluctuations using
              carbon cycle box models using appropriate inputs from sedimentary Cd/Ca,Ba/Ca,,
              C,  15N and ice core 18 O to constrain ocean ventilation rates and biological
              pump variability. Existing ice core records of  36Cl and  10Be will be used in
              conjunction with the SINT-200 and NAPIS-75 paleomagnetic records, and with new
              stalagmite 10 Be and 129 I records to constrain 14 C fluctuations stemming from
              solar and magnetic forcing. A particular focus of these efforts will be
              evaluation of climate induced changes in the carbon cycle that may have
              accompanied Heinrich events H1,H2,
H3, H4 and H5 and Dansgaard/Oeschger cycles
              1-12.  Among the broader impacts of this proposed work is a better
              understanding of the potential linkages between climate and the carbon cycle
              for conditions of enhanced freshwater flux to the polar oceans.

This work
              will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of
              Bristol, England, and Royal Holloway, University of London, England. This
              collaborative effort will utilize stalagmites already in the Bristol collection
              and identified as good candidates in the appropriate age range for this
              exercise. Separate funding for the UK portion of this research for generation
              of TIMS U/Th chronology, stable isotope records, and part of the modeling
              effort has already been procured through grants from NERC and the Leverhulme
              Trust foundation (see letter of support). Stalagmite  18O records will also be
              generated as part of the UK effort, to be used for correlating  14 C
              fluctuations with GISP2 climate records (Wang et al.,2001; Dorale et al.,1998).
              Funds are requested in this proposal to only support the AMS  14 C measurement
              component of this effort, and to support the University of Arizona component of
              the coupled carbon cycle modeling effort.
