Dr. Nemiroff is awarded funds to support the CONCAM project at
              Michigan Technological University. CONtinuous CAMeras (CONCAMs) are fisheye
              night sky web cameras that provide astronomers at major national and
              international observing sites with real-time images from which cloud cover,
              skyglow, and air transparency can be immediately recovered. Within the past two
              years, a global network of CONCAMs has begun to operate.   The PI and his
              students will use the funds to write the software that will make CONCAM images
              available in real-time, and to design a pipeline that will eventually convert
              CONCAM images into real-time data products such as continuously updated all-sky
              maps of skyglow and transparency.  These products will constitute a real
              service for observers and robotic telescopes needing to make observing
              decisions in real time. Software will also be designed for an automated bright
              transient search, potentially leading to significant discoveries from the
              CONCAM data itself.
