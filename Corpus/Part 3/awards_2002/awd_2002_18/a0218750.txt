Abstract    :
              The goal is to provide new numerical and computational tools to reach a new
              milestone: performing computer simulations of the last fewinspiraling orbits of
              two black holes and their violent collision and merger.  The dynamics of such a
              binary black hole system is governed by Einstein's equations for general
              relativity. To solve the very complex Einstein equations on the computer,
              special methods are developed that improve the computational efficiency so that
              fully three-dimensional simulations become possible on a routine basis.  This
              requires taking the pecularities of Einstein's general relativity into account,
              in particular finding good explicit coordinates (so that the computer can
              handle the `everything is relative' of general relativity) and dealing with the
              spacetime singularities that lurk inside black holes.

It is remarkable that
              even today the two body problem of general relativity still remains unsolved. 
              Especially the problem of dynamics of two black holes in a binary has drawn
              considerable attention, but
not even a single orbit of two black holes has
              been simulated.  The orbital motion of black holes follows a spiral that leads
              to thecollision and merger of the black holes, which is expected to produce
              large amounts of gravitational radiation.  The community of gravitational wave
              astronomers urgently awaits predictions for the merger waves of black holes
              from computer simulations.
