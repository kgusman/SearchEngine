The military is the single largest employer of young men in the
              United States, and military recruitment is an often hotly debated topic
              centering on issues such as access, equality of representation by race and
              gender, and transferability of training to the civilian labor market.  This
              project examines the determinants and consequences of military service by
              studying varied interrelationships between military service and numerous
              life-course outcomes.  The PIs will investigate several possible explanations
              for observed effects of military services. First, men who serve in the military
              may be a select group who would otherwise be expected to vary in their
              life-course transitions. Second, military service alters the roles and
              responsibilities of young men for extended periods of time, often subjecting
              them to stressful and unfamiliar environments.  Such may lead to lasting
              differences in life-course patterns.  Third, military service ma have an impact
              on subsequent life-course events by interrupting other events in the life
              course. 

Three nationally representative databases: The National
              Longitudinal Study of Mature Men, The National Longitudinal Study of Young Men,
              and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, will be analyzed.  These will
              allow the investigators to identify differential characteristics of young men,
              who enter the military, to untangle and model the life course processes by
              which military service affects subsequent life-course evens, and to determine
              how these processes might have changed from World War II through the Vietnam
              era and AVF.  The project will contribute to our understanding of the processes
              by which military service affects the fluid, and often disorderly, life-course
              experiences of young men.
