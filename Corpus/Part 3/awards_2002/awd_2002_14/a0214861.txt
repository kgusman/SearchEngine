Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop a sensitive and rapid method for detecting rare cells infected with
              viruses. Although PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) has revolutionized nucleic
              acid detection, leakage of amplicons from cells during thermocycling, an
              inherent problem in conventional procedures, limits its use for in situ PCR
              applications. Furthermore, microscopic visualization after in situ PCR is
              tedious and not amenable to rare cell detection. Development of a rapid method
              to identify and quantify activation of genes involved in viral infection and
              tumorigenesis in single rare cells would significantly benefit both research as
              well as clinical applications such as diagnosis and therapeutic staging. The
              Phase I research will develop the assay using model cell lines infected with
              the human T-cell leukemia virus type I.

The commercial applications of this
              project will be in the area of diagnostics linked to the managemement of
              genetically based diseases.
