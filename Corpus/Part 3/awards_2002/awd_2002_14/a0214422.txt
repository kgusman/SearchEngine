ABSTRACT
Rementer & Pearson 0214422

With National Science Foundation
              support, Mr. James Rementer and Dr. Bruce Pearson will review and convert to
              digital format some 1,000 hours of tape-recorded material in the Delaware
              Indian language dating back to the mid-20th century. Although this language has
              been studied in the past and belongs to the widely studied Algonquian family,
              little information about the structure of the language is available in a form
              that is readily usable by contemporary English-speaking members of the tribe or
              the general public. The project will result in the digitized preservation of
              the old analog recordings, many now growing brittle, and will lead to permanent
              storage of the material in a format that will bring together phonetic
              renditions of words and phrases, sound files of the words and phrases
              pronounced by the last generation of native speakers, and in many cases,
              pictures of cultural items being named. A reference CD that will teach some of
              the language basics will also be produced and made available to Delaware Tribal
              members as well as the general public.

In addition to the importance of the
              project to the 11,000 members of the Oklahoma-based Delaware tribe, the
              language is historically important. It was once spoken over an area of almost
              25,000 square miles, including all of New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania,
              northern Delaware. and southeastern New York. It was also significant as the
              language used between the Lenape and the early Dutch, Swedish, and English
              settlers in the area. It was the medium used to deal with William Penn when he
              established the Pennsylvania colony in the 17th century. The importance of
              Lenape continued through the period of American independence and westward
              expansion to the end of the 19th century. The language remained in use in
              Oklahoma through the 20th century and survived until August, 2002, in the
              memory of a 98-year-old man. Some middle-aged tribal members have a limited
              command of the language, as do a few scholars. The storage format developed for
              preservation of the materials will facilitate efforts of the Delaware tribe to
              create language-teaching materials. This documentation will also support the
              work of linguists, folklorists, and historians in researching narratives
              contained in the material and in preparing English translations and/or
              bilingual editions of Delaware texts of interest to a wider public.
