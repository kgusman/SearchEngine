Abstract    :
              Professor Benner will lead a project that combines organic synthesis, biological
              chemistry, in vitro evolution (lVE) and univariate statistical analysis that
              will develop the physical organic chemical tools needed to quantitate the
              impact of adding chemical functionality (amino, thiol, imidazole, peptides, and
              metal chelating groups) via covalent attachment to catalytic DNA molecules.
              This work will first address the paradox that arises from the observation that
              endowing DNA and RNA libraries with additional functionality evidently improves
              the catalytic potential of nucleic acids by only a factor of two to ten, not by
              the orders of magnitude expected from standard Structure Theory in Organic
              Chemistry. A set of five hypotheses that account for the orders-of-magnitude
              discrepancy between expectation and observation will be tested, including
              models that hold (a) that our view of the role of functionality in catalysis is
              naive, (b) that the functional endowment of natural DNA (phosphates and
              hydrogen bond donating and accepting groups) are sufficient for catalysis in
              general, (c) that the functionality recruited non-covalently by nucleic acids
              from solution (in particular, divalent cations such as Mg++) overwhelms the
              contribution of covalently linked functionality, (d) that lVE experiments lose
              the best catalysts, and (e) that more than one type of functional group is
              needed before the expected large benefit from functionality is seen. This will
              require careful assessment of the kinetic order of the reaction being effected
              by the selected DNA molecules (first order, unimolecular, with the catalytic
              step rate determining?).

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program (OMC) and the Molecular Biochemistry Program in the Division
              of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) will support the research of
              Professor Steven A. Benner of the University of Florida.  Professor Benner's
              work is expected to have broad impact. From a practical perspective, we may
              learn how to truly get "catalysis on demand" from IVE experiments, useful for
              everything from biomedicine to environmental remediation. From a scientific
              perspective, we will understand in greater depth the possibilities of single
              biopolymer systems playing a role in the origin of life. From a methodological
              perspective, he will develop tools that permit IVE to explore the distribution
              of chemical properties in "structure space" defined by a DNA sequence. And,
              from a theoretical perspective, the work may end up altering, perhaps
              dramatically, our global view of the relationship between functionality and
              reactivity in nucleic acids.
