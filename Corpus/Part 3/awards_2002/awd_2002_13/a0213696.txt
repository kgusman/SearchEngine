Abstract    :
              The goal of this award is to develop a high-resolution portrait of the Late
              Glacial-Early Holocene transition in middle North America using data from
              tree-rings. In this study, the environmental changes in middle North America
              will be investigated over several millennia (ca. 10,000 to 14,000 years ago)
              during the Late Glacial-Early Holocene transition, including the Younger Dryas
              (YD) interval. 

The warming from the Late Glacial to the Early Holocene was
              interrupted by an abrupt, millennial-length, cold climate excursion known as
              the YD event. The environmental effects of this climatic event seem to be
              widespread, but knowledge of the character of the YD in Europe far exceeds that
              of North America. North America has potential links with the physical
              mechanisms likely to have triggered the event in the middle North Atlantic
              Ocean such as shifting glacial meltwater outlets from the land to the ocean.
              

The environmental changes during the YD (i.e., those related to
              temperature, water-use efficiency, and hydrologic cycle-related parameters of
              precipitation, relative humidity, and soil saturation) will be measured against
              those of the time periods immediately before and after, and with modern
              conditions. The results will improve our understanding of the environmental and
              faunal changes and responses in middle North America. This will help place such
              changes in the context of global environmental change during deglaciation.
