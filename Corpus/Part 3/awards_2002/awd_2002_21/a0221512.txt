Abstract    :
              Transient luminous events (TLEs) such as red sprites, blue jets, and elves are
              spectacular phenomena that link tropospheric electrical activity with the
              stratosphere and mesosphere.  These phenomena are almost always associated with
              positive cloud-to-ground lightning, which occurs less frequently than
              negatively charged lightning.  Two storm types are known to produce positive
              lightning, namely supercell storms and nocturnal mesoscale convective systems. 
              The STEPS project (Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation
              Study), conducted in western Kansas in the early summer of 2000, provided the
              most comprehensive data available on sprites and sprite-producing storms.  More
              than 1200 TLEs were observed and video-recorded at the Yucca Ridge Field
              Station of FMA Research, Inc.  These data were collected in association with
              other storm observations on STEPS, including dual-Doppler and polarimetric
              radar data, aircraft microphysical measurements, high-resolution lightning
              maps, and balloon-borne measurements of the electrical field.  This award
              supports further analysis of the TLE observations from STEPS, and enables the
              continuation of sprite monitoring during the summers of 2003-2005.  The main
              objectives are (1) to characterize the relationship between lightning and
              sprites; (2) to classify the storm types that do and do not produce sprites. 
              The approach is to analyze the TLE records from STEPS in relation to the radar,
              lightning, and other data.  Results will be an improved understanding of the
              conditions attendant to sprite formation, and hence the physics of TLEs.
