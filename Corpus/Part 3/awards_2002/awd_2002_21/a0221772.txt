This grant supports costs associated with a planning
              conference  to be held at the Granlibakken Conference Center in Tahoe City, CA
              on 25-26 July 2002. 
The intent of the planning conference is to develop the
              foundation of a community-supported and accessible science center/computational
              facility proposal to be submitted in the future to the Division of Earth
              Sciences. Approximately 40 participants representing leading scholars in the
              fields of geophysical modeling, seismology and geodynamo theory from U.S. and
              international academia and government laboratories will attend.  In principle,
              the center would focus on open development and implementation of complex
              numerical algorithms for simulating the dynamics of deep earth processes, many
              of which are difficult if not impossible to verify experimentally.  The
              facility would enable more realistic and complex models of mantle and core
              convection and geomagnetic field behavior to be developed and run than is
              currently possible due to limited and/or dedicated computational and personnel
              resources of individual investigators, academic institutions and supercomputer
              centers.  The ideal facility would also ensure sharing and standardized
              benchmarking of important geodynamic codes not only across the U. S. academic
              community, but also internationally.  Further, such a facility would ultimately
              provide access to investigators and their students who are currently hampered
              by insufficient resources, both computational and intellectual, to become
              involved in state-of-the-art theoretical geodynamic research.
