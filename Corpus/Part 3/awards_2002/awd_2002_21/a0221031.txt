Abstract    :
              Recent studies with highly sensitive CCD camera systems deployed from the
              submersible ALVIN have revealed light being emitted from hydrothermal fluids
              venting at the ocean floor. In general, these studies reveal photon fluxes from
              the vent fluids in excess of those predicted from simple blackbody radiation,
              suggesting a number of in-situ light-generating processes.  In particular,
              chemiluminescence (emission of light that accompanies chemical reactions),
              sonoluminescence (light emitted by vapor bubble implosion or cavitation), or
              crystalloluminescence (emission of light accompanying onset of mineral
              precipitation) are thought to be the mose likely processes to account for this.
               This investigation is designed to assess unambiguously the intensity and
              spectral characteristics of light generated by chemical reactions, vapor
              generation, effects and crystallization processes at temperatures and pressures
              applicable to marine hydrothermal systems.  Under this award, the PIs will use
              a series of computer controlled Ti-flow reactors, modified to contain optical
              windows, fiber optic cables, spectrometer, and CCD detector that will allow the
              intensity and spectral variability of light to be measured and monitored.  The
              experiments will be designed to specifically assess the role of
              chemiluminescence, sonoluminescence and crystalloluminescnce on light
              generation for an appropriate range of temperatures, pressures, compositional
              effects, and fluid flow rates.  The experiments will include a number of
              in-situ chemical sensors developed at to better constrain the distribution of
              aqueous species during the experiments, while simultaneously linking these data
              to spectral observations.
