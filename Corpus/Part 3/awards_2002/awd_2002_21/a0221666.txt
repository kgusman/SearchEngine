Accurate computational
              representations of complex geometry 
are of great importance in many
              disciplines ranging from 
engineering and manufacturing to medicine and
              biology.  With 
the wide availability of powerful computational resources and
              
ever better acquisition technologies such as 3D laser 
scanning and
              volumetric MRI or CAT imaging the geometries 
used in applications are
              becoming increasingly complex. One 
aspect of this complexity is topology,
              i.e., the presence
of holes and tunnels and of a network of one and
              
zero-dimensional surface features such as creases and spikes.  
Typical
              examples of topologically complex shapes are a 
perforated plate or the system
              of blood vessels of the body. 
Traditional representations of geometry are at
              worst weak 
and at best cumbersome and inefficient in representing
such
              complex topologies.  Modeling of macro- and microscopic 
biological structures
              is becoming increasingly important 
for medical research, training, and
              treatment support. Such 
structures often have extremely complex shape and
              topology 
(e.g., the blood vessel or the nervous system, facial
muscles, a
              folded protein molecule). The representations 
and algorithms we develop will
              result in new efficient ways 
of manipulating and processing computer
              representations of 
such structures. 

In this project a team with expertise
              in numerical analysis, 
geometric modeling, discrete algorithms and computer
              graphics 
is studying ways to bring fundamental mathematical tools 
and
              highly efficient algorithms to bear on the challenge 
of creating efficient
              and accurate computational 
representations and algorithms for surfaces of
              complex
topology.  In particular we are investigating theory and 
practical
              algorithms for (I) removal of topological noise 
in existing models as well as
              in raw data used for surface 
reconstruction; (II) topology discovery in
              volumetric 
data sets; (III) construction of multiresolution 
representations
              of geometry which can meaningfully
abstract fine level topology at coarser
              resolutions to 
enable powerful multiscale techniques for rendering,
              
modification and simulation. Particular attention is paid 
to exploring
              measures of topological scale which are 
crucial to most of the algorithms
              being developed.  The 
algorithms to be developed by the team will have
              immediate 
applications in two areas:  Computer-Aided Design and 
Medical
              Visualization.  In CAD, examples of potential 
applications include topology
              cleanup, simplification 
for integration of scanned 3D data with manually
              
constructed models and use of multiscale representations 
for interactive
              conceptual design representations.
