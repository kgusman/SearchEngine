This award supports 15 African participants in a US-Southern
              Africa Workshop on "Synthesis of SAFARI 2000 - Implications for Local and
              Regional Science and Policy," scheduled for October 8-13, 2002, in
              Charlottesville, Virginia.  The co-organizers are Professor Robert Swap, with
              the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia, and
              Professor Harold Annegarn, with the Atmosphere and Energy Group at the
              University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.  There will be a total of about
              150 participants, approximately one third of whom will come from US academic
              institutions, one third from various countries in Southern Africa, and the
              remainder from governmental, nongovernmental and international organizations. 
              This workshop will enable the researchers to synthesize and interpret valuable
              information from the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (known as
              SAFARI 2000), and to also plan the next phase of regional environmental
              research.  It is expected that this meeting will lead to the development of
              collaborative, interdisciplinary research and education projects.

SAFARI
              2000 was an international science project to investigate the linkages across
              time and space scales between Southern Africa's terrestrial, atmospheric, and
              biogeochemical processes, and their impacts on regional and global
              environmental change.  The project involved nearly 300 participants from 18
              different countries.  This workshop will enable participants, some of whom are
              US and African students and junior investigators, to review the current state
              of understanding about and missing information on land-atmosphere-biosphere
              interactions concerning Southern Africa, and explore emerging areas of
              cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary research that will advance the
              knowledge on the natural functioning of Southern Africa's ecosystems.  They
              will also participate in the process for translating the research results into
              a format that is relevant to society.  A synthesis of the results of SAFARI
              2000 will be produced in a workshop report, thus providing valuable new
              information to the international global environmental change community, as well
              as to local and regional policy makers.  Results will also be disseminated
              through professional journal articles and via a web site.

The Office of
              International Science and Engineering, the Division of Atmospheric Sciences,
              and the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences jointly support this
              award.
