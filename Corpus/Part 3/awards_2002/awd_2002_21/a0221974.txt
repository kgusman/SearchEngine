Abstract    :
              This award is an Accomplishment-Based Renewal for the PIs to continue to develop
              mathematical models of seafloor hydrothermal processes.  The award will support
              modeling studies divided into two main scientific themes:  Stability and
              Temporal Variability.  The models will be strongly linked to observations, and,
              hopefully, the model predictions will guide subsequent field efforts.   The
              Stability theme addresses fundamental aspects of heat transfer across the basal
              boundary layer.  The main objective is to develop a fracture mechanics model
              that yields heat and mass transfer in ridge crest systems that is consistent
              with observations and that addresses the stability and propagation of fractures
              at the base of the hydrothermal system.  The Temporal Variability theme
              addresses processes of:  (a) permeability evolution resulting from mixing
              between hot deep-circulating hydrothermal fluids and cooler, shallowly
              circulating seawater and (b) hydrothermal system response to earthquakes. 
              Development of these models will be closely linked to various data sets
              including thermal and isotopic data from the EPR 9- 10N, the Souther EPR, and
              the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  The Broader Implications of this research center on
              the training and education of both undergraduate students, suport of the RIDGE
              2000 Integrated Studies (IS) program, and broa dissemination of research
              results.
