Abstract    :
              
The proposal was submitted in response to the FY2002 Chemical and Transport
              Systems equipment solicitation, described in NSF Announcement. NSF 01-93.  The
              PIs propose to acquire two pieces of equipment that will establish a
              significant experimental capability in micro/nanoscale transport phenomena at
              the University of Texas at Austin.  Research activities enabled by this
              equipment include thermal property measurements of nanostructures and in low
              conductivity dielectric films, investigation of heat dissipation mechanisms in
              carbon nanotubes, and near-field laser manufacturing and nanoscale fluorescence
              imaging.  Application of these nanostructures, including carbon nanotubes and
              semiconductor nanowires, in the areas o nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and
              thermoelectric cooling has great technological potoential.  The equipment will
              also be utilized in new graduate courses at U.T.-Austin.  Funding is from the
              Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing of the Chemical and Transport Systems
              Division.
