This is a proposal to carry out research on the interaction
              between device physics and circuit design using nano-scale double-gate SQI CMOS
              technology. Fully depleted, double-gate (FD-DG) S0I is currently recognized as
              the most suitable SOI version for nano-scale integration. Published research
              has focused on the physics of the device in isolation, in an effort to
              establish and examine the many attractive advantages, and connect them with the
              device design. However, viewed from the circuit point of view, more often than
              not these advantages come at the expense of higher capacitances and leakage
              currents, which (if unchecked) might degrade the circuit performance and
              reliability. It will be the central theme of the proposed research to seek out
              the subtleties of the devise design most relevant to circuit implementations,
              with the ultimate goal to skew the device design space towards better circuit
              performance, and suggest suitable circuit alternatives that derive maximum
              benefit from the use of DG devices. For example, it is not known a priori that
              the enhanced drive current of the DG transistor will make up for its enhanced
              capacitance, and one needs to examine the circuit topology for each of the DG
              structures available. Since DG structures suffer less from short channel
              effects (SCE) and supply double the current, thicker oxides can be used, which
              also lower the gate capacitance. Floating body effects (FBE) are thought to be
              inactive in DG structures; FBEs might, however, be triggered by deliberate (or
              otherwise) bias conditions, for example by inducing an overpopulation of holes
              in the body of an nMOS device. DG devices are currently been vigorously
              researched and evolving, and are commonly categorized as symmetric (SDG) and
              asymmetric (ADG). The SDG is a "normally on" device and for this and other
              reasons the favor is currently with the ADG device. Rather than modify the SDG
              device at the expense of complicated processing, the possibility will be
              investigated of using this intrinsically on structure as a load device for
              DG-SOI based ratioed logic, with ADG drivers.
