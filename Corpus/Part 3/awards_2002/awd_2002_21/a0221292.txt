Recent compilations of climate-related observations
              show that important changes are now underway in the High Arctic, probably as a
              response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions over the last approximately
              250 years. These changes include warming of the troposphere, reductions in sea
              ice cover, decreases in snow cover area, warming of tundra permafrost, and
              negative mass balances of glaciers and ice caps. In many instances,
              observations of change are relatively short in duration or sparse in spatial
              extent. The Principal Investigators will study glacier and ice cap variations
              over the approximately last 80 years and at a large scale on Svalbard.  The
              islands contain the largest extent of glacier ice in northern Eurasia,
              amounting to about 0.03 meters of sea level equivalent water in storage.
              Measurements of glacier variations and mass balance have been conducted
              continuously on Svalbard since 1966, but most investigations are restricted to
              small glaciers in northwestern Svalbard. The behavior and current status of
              most large glaciers and ice caps is largely unknown.  The work contained in
              this proposal involves using high resolution, modern satellite imagery to map
              current glacier and ice cap extents. These maps will be compared with archival
              information to assess rates and styles of change. The primary type of modern
              imagery to be used will be from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and
              Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument carried onboard Terra. Archival
              sources of information include geodetic maps, Declassified Intelligence
              Satellite Photography (DISP) imagery and Landsat MSS (Multi-spectral Scanner)
              imagery.  The overall aim of the proposed work is to understand the current
              mass balance of ice masses in Svalbard and their current and future
              contribution to sea level change. There are several objectives: 1) mapping
              modern boundaries of glaciers and ice caps in Svalbard using satellite imagery
              and comparing those with archival information to assess changes over a 50 or
              longer year period; 2) constructing time series of snow facies extent and late
              summer snowline positions using remotely sensed data to determine short- and
              medium-term variability; 3) mapping changes in ice flow to determine the
              importance of flow instabilities; 4) using observed changes to assess spatial 
              variability in glacier and ice cap mass balance across the archipelago; and 5)
              interpreting the causes of observed changes.
