Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PIs will measure 176Hf/177Hf and 238U-230Th-226Ra-232Th
              activities in basalt glasses from the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR)to test how
              the depth and rate of melting control the sampling of regional heterogeneity in
              the underlying mantle during ocean ridge magmatism. With these new data, it
              should be possible to sort out differences in the mineralogy of the mantle
              source, the depth and extent of melting, and the source compositions. The SEIR
              was chosen for the study, because along it a number of systematic variations
              occur at constant full spreading rate (70-75 mm/y) and in the absence of large
              transform offsets and nearby ocean island hotspots:(a)there is a large eastward
              increase in axial depth (2300 to 5000 m) and a morphological transition from
              axial high to axial valley; (b) there is evidence that melt production rate and
              crustal thickness decrease eastward along axis; and (c) lavas from this setting
              record systematic variations in temperature and mantle composition. It has also
              been the subject of previous petrologic and isotopic analyses of numerous
              basalt glasses. The PIs will search for and use correlations of 230Th/232Th,
              230Th/238U, Th/U, 226Ra/230Th, Ba/Th and 176Hf/177Hf with these physical and
              geochemical variations to test two fundamental hypotheses:1) A regional
              increase in ridge depth at constant spreading rate is primarily controlled by
              the depth and rate of melting. 2) The distinctive Pb-Sr-Nd isotope signature of
              Indian Ocean MORBs is due to the presence of garnet pyroxenite in the shallow
              asthenosphere.
