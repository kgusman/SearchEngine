The San Andreas Fault zone Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) Pilot Hole will
              provide an excellent opportunity for exploring the relationship between fault
              slip and the thermal evolution of the crust by studying core samples from
              varying depths using two complementary thermochronologic methods.  The Pilot
              Hole, located in Parkfield, CA  less than two kilometers from the San Andreas
              fault will reach a depth of 2.1 km.  The borehole will intersect Salinian
              granite rocks at a depth of less than 1 km and similar granitic rocks outcrop
              at the surface within a few kilometers of the Pilot Hole.  The Principal
              Investigators will analyze samples from borehole cuttings at depth intervals of
              100 - 200 m and from the surface outcrops.  They will determine the thermal
              history of the samples using apatite fission track and U/Th-He
              thermochronometers.

This study will explore the complex interplay between
              uplift, erosion, and heat flow by using multiple thermochronologic systems on
              samples from a vertical profile.  These data will allow the PIs to separate the
              effects of uplift from changes in the geothermal gradient, such as those
              resulting from the long-term frictional heat generated along the San Andreas
              fault.  Because the uplift history at Parkfield is controlled, in part, by slip
              along the San Andreas fault, their work will also provide information about the
              kinematics of the fault.
