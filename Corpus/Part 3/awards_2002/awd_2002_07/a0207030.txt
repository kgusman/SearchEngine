The PI will work on a number of projects in
              low dimensional
topology and its applications.  These projects include
              
investigating various properties of the Turaev-Viro
invariants including the
              construction of universal 
polynomials relating the representation theory of
              the 
fundamental groups of manifolds to these invariants and the 
extension
              of these invariants away from the unit circle. 
In addition, the PI will
              consider, given a tetrahedral 
decomposition of a knot, how one may define a
              rigorous
path integral over the space of cross ratios of the tetrahedra 
to
              compute the Turaev-Viro invariant of an integral surgery 
on the knot.  The PI
              will also investigate the structure of 
the Kauffman bracket skein module in
              terms of the geometry 
of  character varieties,and, more generally, use
              quantum 
invariants in the study of Dehn surgery on knots.  Finally, 
this
              award provides support for the PI's graduate students 
to assist him in this
              research.   

Topology is a kind of geometry where the congruence
              
transformations do not preserve metric properties such 
as distance and
              angle. The objects the PI studies are 
given as the result of gluing together
              polyhedra along faces. 
To know when two such objects are different
              topologically one 
needs to make measurements that are unchanged by
              
topological congruence transformations. An example of 
such a measurement is
              the Euler characteristic of a 
surface, which is the number of vertices minus
              the
number of edges plus the number of faces. If two surfaces 
are
              topologically equivalent they have the same Euler 
characteristic.  One of the
              most celebrated theorems of 
geometry is the Gauss-Bonnet theorem which
              relates the 
Euler characteristic of any surface to a quantity 
computed
              metrically. Quantum invariants of three manifolds 
are like Euler
              characteristic, but more delicate. They 
are constructed statistically from a
              probability space 
made up of "states" which come from the description 
of
              how polyhedra are glued together to form the object. 
The PI's work is about
              relating these invariants to 
metric quantities derived from the geometry of
              the
underlying object. To this end, the PI shows that 
the space of states
              can be replaced by spaces of 
geometric measurements made on the object. The
              goal 
of the project is to see how the geometry and topology 
of the object
              are determined by its combinatorial 
description in terms of polyhedra.
