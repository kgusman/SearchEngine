     The investigator and her colleague aim to
              develop
theoretically a novel method, the DSM-dynamical system method,
for
              solving a wide variety of linear and nonlinear ill-posed
problems, to
              implement algorithms based on this method, and to
demonstrate the advantages
              of this method in efficiency and
accuracy.  The DSM method is used as a
              general approach to the
construction of regularizing algorithms for solving
              ill-posed
problems, i.e. a stopping rule is developed: a rule for
              choosing
that moment of time at which the value of the solution to the
basic
              evolution equation stably approximates the solution to the
original ill-posed
              equation in the case when the data are given
with some error.  Applications of
              different versions of the DSM
are considered to classical ill-posed problems
              of computational
mathematics, such as stable differentiation of noisy data,
              stable
inversion of ill-conditioned matrices, and to nonlinear
              inverse
problems arising in geophysics, quantum physics, medicine,
              remote
sensing in technology, and other applied areas.  The DSM
              with
simultaneous updates of the inverse derivative operator without
actual
              inverting of this operator is developed for solving
nonlinear ill-posed
              problems.  The DSM is used as a general method
for constructing convergent
              iterative processes for solving
ill-posed operator equations.  Namely,
              convergent discretization
schemes for solving the basic evolution equation of
              the DSM
provide convergent iterative methods for solving the
              original
equation.  The DSM is developed for unbounded operators, which
              do
not have continuous inverse operators, and also for a nonlinear
operators
              whose derivative is a Fredholm operator with nontrivial
null-space.
     The
              area of ill-posed (unstable) problems is extremely
difficult, because
              solutions to ill-posed problems are very
sensitive to small variation in input
              data.  For that reason
ill-posed problems cannot be solved by classical
              methods: the
corresponding numerical procedures for them turn out to
              be
divergent.  However, ill-posed problems are frequently encountered
in many
              branches of natural sciences and engineering:
astrophysics, geophysics,
              spectroscopy, plasma diagnostics,
computerized tomography, antenna design,
              optimal design of
technical systems and engineering constructions,
              optimal
planning, optimal control over various processes, and many
              other
fields.  Mathematical statements of these problems are given in
the
              form of operator equations of the first kind, problems of
functional
              minimization, problems of determining values of
unbounded operators,
              variational inequalities, and so on.  The
project develops computational
              methods that provide more accurate
solutions to a wide range of ill-posed
              problems.  The investigator
also uses the results in the graduate courses on
              ill-posed and
inverse problems she teaches at Georgia State
              University.
Finally, because ill-posed problems are of basic importance
              in
applications, the results are of wide use in engineering and
applied
              sciences.
