The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research
              fellowship by Dr. Rhiannon Lynne Allen to work with Dr. Brett Gladman at the
              University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Support for
              this project is provided by the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate's
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.

The Kuiper Belt is the population of
              primitive bodies found between 30 and 100 AU from the Sun.  As a large remnant
              planetesimal population, the Kuiper Belt provides a unique opportunity to study
              planet formation.  A record of the history of the outer Solar System is written
              in the dynamical distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).  Studying their
              physical characteristics, size distribution and volume density provides
              valuable constraints for planetesimal accretion and collision evolution models.
               The PI proposes a three part observing program to expand the present
              understanding of the Kuiper Belt: (1) a wide field, shallow survey to provide a
              large sample of KBO's, (2) a smaller scale, deep survey to place limits on the
              density of the smallest KBO's and the distant Kuiper Belt and (3) individual
              observations to obtain lightcurves and color photometry for a range of KBO's to
              explore physical properties of KBO's.

Dr. Gladman has organized an
              international collaboration to conduct a wide field survey of the Kuiper Belt
              using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope  (CFHT) and the Megaprime Camera,
              which has a 1 square degree field of view.
