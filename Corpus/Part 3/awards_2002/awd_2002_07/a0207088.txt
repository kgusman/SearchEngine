Abstract    :
              An MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-DRF)
              will be used to develop an optobioelectronic switch by functionalizing gold
              nanoparticles with photoisomerizable thiols.   There will be three stages in
              this project: (1) Synthesis and characterization of gold particles, (2)
              functionalization of nanoparticles with photoisomerizable molecules and
              characterization of the transduction of the optical signal using bulk
              measurement techniques, and (3) use of STM-SNOM to simultaneously provide the
              optical signal and measure the electrochemical transduction of that signal at a
              functionized nanoparticle.  Most of the program will be hosted at Wolfgang
              Knoll's group at the Max Planck Institut fur Polymerforschung, where expertise
              will be provided in surface functionalization and characterization and the
              infrastructure necessary to achieve the objectives of this project.  One month
              will be spent at Franz Aussenegg's group at the Institut fur Experimentalphysik
              at the Karl-Franzens-Universitat Graz, Austria, where there is expertise with
              nano-optics necessary to use the STM-SNOM system for these experiments. 
              Another month will be spent with Itamar Willner in the Department of Organic
              Chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, where the thiols will
              be provided and also advice will be obtained on implementing them in building
              the proposed optobioelectronic switch.
