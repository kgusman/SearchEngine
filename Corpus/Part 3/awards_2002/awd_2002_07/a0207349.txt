	Birds
              (avialan dinosaurs) are unique among living animals in showing extremely rapid
              growth rates. How they attained this capacity is unknown. In our research we
              will reconstruct the growth of the earliest birds and their closest ancestors,
              the coelurosaurian dinosaurs. We will do this by coupling age estimates
              (garnered through growth line counts) with size estimates for a diversity of
              fossil species. From the results we will be able to quantitatively assess when
              and how avian growth rates were generated and determine whether the first birds
              were simply feathered dinosaurs or physiological equivalents to living species.
              Aside from helping us to understand how the most speciose group of animals
              living in our world came to came to be, broader impacts of this research
              include: 1) establishing a World Wide Web site from which the lay pubic and
              professions can learn about scientific research, 2) providing advanced
              scientific training to undergraduate and graduate students including those from
              underrepresented groups, and 3) providing material for our public and non-major
              collegiate lectures in paleontology.
