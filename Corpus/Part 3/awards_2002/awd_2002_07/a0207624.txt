Abstract    :
              A transient event in Guerrero, Mexico, propagated from east to west
              along-strike, near the locking transition on the megathrust, and it affected
              the entire length of the Guerrero seismic gap over a period of months during
              early 1998. Campaign GPS data suggest the possibility that the 1998 Guerrero
              event is causally related to afterslip following the 1995 Mw=7.3 Copala
              earthquake. The Copala earthquake was located about 120 km east of the Guerrero
              gap, but afterslip appears to have propagated westward along-strike as much as
              100 km during the first six months following the seismic rupture. Curiously,
              background seismic activity on the Guerrero megathrust unusually quiescent
              during the several months before, during and after the aseismic slip event, but
              returns to normal or above-normal levels several months after the transient
              ended. These observations raise several fundamental questions. First, did the
              Guerrero aseismic slip event really begin as afterslip following the Copala
              earthquake? Or is the occurrence of aseismic slip east of Acapulco in 1995-96
              and west of Acapulco in 1998 merely coincidental? Secondly, how did the stress
              changes generated by these aseismic slip events influence seismic activity on
              the megathrust?
This research project is examining these questions using
              JERS-1 InSAR data collected during the years 1994.2 to 1997.3 to estimate
              coseismic slip of the Copala event and postseismic afterslip in the region east
              of Acapulco. Also, strong ground motion seismic data from the Guerrero
              accelerograph network and broadband data from the Mexican regional network are
              being used to estimate earthquake source parameters from events with magnitude
              Mw<7 that had never been examined previously. The events are being relocated
              using modern network differencing techniques, and the focal mechanisms, moment
              release, stress drops and other source parameters are also being characterized.
              The research team is combining the geodetic and seismic source to the slip
              history on the subduction megathrust during the past decade, and the associated
              change in Coulomb failure criteria as a function of time. The researchers are
              also assessing the space-time connection between Copala earthquake afterslip
              and the Guerrero slip transient, as well as the relationship between aseismic
              slip and seismic activity, using a model of nonlinear dynamic friction on the
              megathrust.
