Abstract    :
              Although our movements seem smooth and continuous to us, they are not.  They are
              generated by the brain in small steps.  This pulsing signal from the brain is
              reflected in our muscles as what is known as physiological tremor; it occurs at
              about 10 pulses per second, and it occurs both during movement and rest.  This
              pulsing signal is thought to save time and computational load in the brain, and
              serves to bring all parts of the motor system into step.  The proposed studies
              will explore the possibility that a crucial part of the brain, the reticular
              activating system, which helps control sleep-wake cycles and arousal as well as
              posture and movement, generates this necessary background of activity, all at
              the same rate of about 10 pulses per second.  Such a background of activity
              could participate in higher processes such as attention as well as lower motor
              processes such as changes in posture or locomotion.  This widespread rhythm
              might be involved in such complex functions as fight-or-flight responses in
              which attention (perceiving a threat) and locomotion (fighting or escaping) are
              coordinated.  In this project, higher brain regions involved in attention as
              well as lower brain regions controlling posture and movement will be studied,
              in order to determine if the reticular activating system talks to both higher
              and lower centers in the same fashion.  This would explain how we can smoothly
              carry out complex fight-or-flight responses, and how we can change states, such
              as from sleeping to waking, and shift our motor system accordingly.
