This grant provides proposal partial support for the upgrade
              of an existing 40Ar/39Ar laser dating laboratory at the University of Alaska
              Fairbanks (UAF).  The upgrade will significantly improve signal stability and
              dating precision, minimize downtime due to equipment failure, extend the useful
              life of the spectrometer, and allow for dating of larger samples or those
              experiments requiring precise temperature control. The laboratory has been
              operating as a 40Ar/39Ar facility since 1990, and the laser system has been in
              operation since 1994.  Specifically, funds will be used to replace the
              electronics in the VG3600 mass spectrometer, purchase a UPS for power
              stability, install an existing resistance-heating furnace, upgrade vacuum
              components, and improve data processing and archiving capabilities.
UAF will
              provide 33% of the direct equipment purchase.  In addition the Geophysical
              Institute of the University of Alaska supports the annual operation of the
              laboratory  (budget is approximately $100,000/yr) with some of the support
              coming from external grants and contracts.  This funding supports a full-time
              laboratory technician, undergraduate student assistants, 3 months of PI time
              and many of the day-to-day operating and maintenance expenses of the
              laboratory.  The Geochronology Laboratory at UAF operates as a regional
              facility with interests in geologic and geochronologic problems in Alaska and
              elsewhere.  The PI maintains strong collaborations with researchers at the
              Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, the United States
              Geological Survey and at U.S. and foreign universities, and it is expected that
              the upgrades will allow these collaborations to continue and expand.  This
              upgrade will prove beneficial for continuing research in thermochronometric and
              chronostratigraphic studies, application of argon isotopes as indicators of
              magmatic processes and the dating of very young samples.
