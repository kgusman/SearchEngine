This award will support the 3rd annual International
              Conference/Workshop on High Resolution Sector Field ICPMS to be held at the
              Department of Geology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA on October 2-5,
              2002.  This international conference is a continuation of the previous two
              successful meetings that were held in Norfolk, Virginia, (2000), and in Vienna,
              Austria (2001).  There are now more than 300 single collector and nearly 100
              multicollector high resolution ICP mass spectrometers around the world.  We
              request funding to organize this meeting to bring together all the scientists
              around the world who work in the field of high resolution ICP mass spectrometry
              and accessory instrumentation (e.g., laser ablation, HPLC, CE, Microdrill
              techniques).  This conference is intended to be a forum for the exchange of
              ideas and the presentation of work completed or in progress, for comment and
              discussion among international research groups working in the same field, as
              well as with research colleagues from the manufacturers to discuss future goals
              and improvements with the instrumentation. The conference will feature newest
              development in the field of high resolution plasma mass spectrometry, and we
              encourage participation of users from all kinds of applications.  We specially
              encourage the participation of graduate students and post-docs.  We will
              summarize the outcomes from this conference in the form of a report documenting
              directions and priorities in ICPMS and HR-ICPMS based-research.  We anticipate
              that this report will comment on the development of useful and appropriate
              instrument-based topics which can be included in undergraduate and graduate
              geosciences curricula.
