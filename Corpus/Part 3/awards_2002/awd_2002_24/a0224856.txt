Abstract    :
              This award provides support for improvements in the electrical and
              communications infrastructure of the Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS).
              Established in 1899, the station located on the East Shore of Flathead Lake,
              within a remarkable area of the Rocky Mountains known as the Crown of the
              Continent.  Station personnel and visiting staff conduct research, training and
              education activities, including various summer courses that take advantage of
              the station's location. The station has 4 long-term core projects: 1)
              floodplain ecology and river restoration, 2) biodiversity and bioproduction
              along biophysical gradients, 3) large lake limnology, and 4) environmental
              change assessment and ecosystem modeling. The station maintains large,
              long-term limnological databases and increasingly relies on high volume,
              remotely-sensed imagery for spatial analysis of ecosystem processes.
              Improvements supported through this award include: 1) underground placement of
              utility lines, 2) emergency backup power and refrigeration; 3) equipment and
              software for data management, network security and archival needs. The proposed
              improvements are central to securing past investment, will facilitate growth of
              collaborative research, and are essential for secure management, distribution,
              and archiving of the massive electronic databases rapidly growing and
              accumulating at FLBS.
