Abstract    :
              This grant supports research on the nucleation, habit, and growth of ice
              crystals under the low temperature and pressure conditions characteristic of
              high cirrus clouds and polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs).  It is a continuation
              of work on the physics of ice crystals that Dr. Hallett and his colleagues have
              done for many years for less extreme conditions.  The static diffusion chamber
              used in previous work will be modified to operate down to temperatures as cold
              as -100C and pressures less than 100 mb.  In the chamber crystals are grown on
              thin (5-10 microns) glass filaments under controlled conditions of temperature,
              pressure, and supersaturation.  Crystal nucleation and growth are examined by
              optical microscopy from outside the chamber and video recorded.  Likely
              nucleants will be added to the filament prior to insertion in the chamber. 
              These include nonvolatile soluble particles, such a sulfuric acid, as well as
              insoluble mineral, meteoritic, and aircraft exhaust material.  Cold,
              high-altitude clouds have important effects on the transfer of solar and
              infrared radiation, and hence global climate.  They also play a part in the
              production and destruction of ozone.  In spite of their importance, the
              physical properties of these clouds are not well known because of the
              difficulty of in situ measurements at heights above the ceiling of most
              aircraft.  The laboratory experiments on this project will simulate the extreme
              atmospheric conditions and provide needed information on the microphysical
              characteristics of clouds which are nearly inaccessible by other means.
