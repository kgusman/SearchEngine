The
              Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of an
              award for summer internship support.  HACU, a national, non-profit
              organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer
              internship opportunities through the organization's National Internship Program
              (NIP).  Through the NIP academically prepared students throughout the US and
              Puerto Rico have received quality internship assignments through various
              federal government agencies. Students who participate in the NIP are exposed to
              various career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping
              them make informed career choices and solidify career objectives.  By
              partnering with the Federal government, HACU has been able to successfully
              place over 3,400 students, representing 30 states and PR, in summer positions
              since NIP commenced in 1992.  In an effort to continue its collaboration with
              HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating government agency for
              the last six years, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the
              exposure of 16 students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering
              and mathematics (STEM).  Internship opportunities create an unique opportunity
              to assist in the fulfillment of two core strategies related the goals of NSF's
              mission: developing intellectual capital, and integrating research and
              education.  As a result the Foundation actively participates in strengthening
              the infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education.
