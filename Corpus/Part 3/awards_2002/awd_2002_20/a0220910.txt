Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project, Fighting Engineers: The U.S. Navy and
              Professional
Mechanical Engineering, 1842-1900, investigates nineteenth
              century Navy social
hierarchy, engineering style, and engineers. Navy
              engineers were few in number before
the Civil War, but the engineering corps
              expanded several fold during the war. Social
conflict developed between combat
              and engineering officers, known throughout the
second half of the century as
              the line-staff dispute. At stake was authority and prestige;
line officers
              were unwilling to share either with shipboard engineers and fought against
any
              encroachment on their traditional privileges. For their part, engineers rallied
              support
in Congress, academia, and industry to gain the respect they felt they
              deserved.
This dissertation connects to a broader historical theme: government
              sponsorship
of technology, an American phenomenon that often has a military
              genesis. From 1865 to
1890, the U.S. Navy created modern mechanical
              engineering at the Naval Academy. The
formation of this new body of technical
              knowledge had dramatic and unforeseen
multiplier effects for the nation. By
              century's end, Navy engineer veterans directed the
largest industrial
              corporations in the country and taught at its finest universities. They
were
              one critical but overlooked factor in nineteenth century American
              economic
development.  Funds for this project support research at the National
              Archives in Washington, D.C.
