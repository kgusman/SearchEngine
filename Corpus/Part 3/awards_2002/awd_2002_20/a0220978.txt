Abstract    :
              OCE-0220978

A PI from the University of Alaska plans to measure
              concentrations of Fe and Fe-binding ligands in the soluble (<0.02 um) and the
              colloidal phase (0.02-0.4 um) of surface waters from the BATS and HOT regions
              to understand the chemical and physical speciation of Fe.  Samples will be
              separated into the soluble and colloidal phase using a new microfiltration
              technique developed by the PI.  Iron concentrations will be measured by an
              isotope dilution-high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
              microanalytical method.  The thermodynamic stability constants and kinetic rate
              constants of Fe-complexing natural ligands in the soluble and colloidal phases
              will be determined by the competitive ligand equilibration/cathodic stripping
              voltammetric method.  The PI also plans to assess the spatial and temporal
              variability of these parameters at these two sites.  Results from this study
              will provide useful constraints for models to determine the biological
              availability of soluble and colloidal Fe, the fate of Fe from dust inputs to
              the surface ocean and the Fe limitation on nitrogen fixation.
