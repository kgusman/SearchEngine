Abstract    :
              Science Summary: Under this award, the PIs propose to study oxygen and hydrogen
              isotopes in samples from the deepest one km. of core from ODP site 735B on
              Atlantis Bank, the deepest penetration of seafloor gabbros in existence. The
              PIs will also analyze strontium isotopes in vein minerals and whole rocks to
              complement the stable isotope measurements. The purpose of these analyses is to
              determine whether the bulk gabbro section is depleted in 18O, as expected in
              models in which seawater d18O is buffered by hydrothermal activity, or whether
              instead the bulk gabbro is enriched in 18O as it is in some inferred
              slow-spreading ophiolites. A final possibility is that the signal of seawater
              interaction diminishes with depth in the crust as observed in the Troodos
              ophiolite and it is this particular hypothesis that the PIs will try to test.
              The bulk d18O values will have implications for mantle effects after subduction
              of 735B-like materials. A second important objective is to determine to what
              extent seawater was involved in high temperature deformation zones in the 735B
              gabbros, and whether late stage magmatic fluids (oxide-rich and/or silica-rich)
              were also involved in the deformation. In addition, the PIs will evaluate the
              extent to which brittle faults served as major conduits for fluids. This part
              of the study has important implications for fluid pathways into the deep ocean
              crust. A final objective of the study is to measure the d18O, D/H, and
              strontium isotope values of secondary mineral veins and felsic veins in the
              lower one km of the core. This is important because these veins affect the bulk
              composition of the section, and also because the veins document the interaction
              between the lower crust and circulating seawater and late magmatic fluids.
