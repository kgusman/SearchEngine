Abstract    :
              The proposed WSSU Computer Science and Technology Scholarship Program is going
              to provide scholarship support to academically talented minority students who
              demonstrate financial need. To fulfill the goal of increasing the number of
              students who enter the high tech workforce or higher education programs, this
              program provides scholarships to junior and senior level undergraduates,
              associate degree transfer students pursuing a degree in computer science; as
              well as to graduate students pursuing a MS degree in computer science and
              information technology. The program is going to attract, enroll, mentor, and
              enhance the academic performance of CSTSP scholars, thereby increasing the
              graduation rate of minority and women students in the fields of computer
              science and information technology. The program is going to provide 27
              scholarships of $3,125 per year per student during the first year, and 27
              scholarships per year during years two to four. 

Three primary objectives of
              the program are to: 1) increase the number of minority and women who enroll in
              computer science; 2) increase the number of minority and women who graduate
              with a BS or MS in computer science and/or computer science and information
              technology; 3) increase the pool of students who are prepared to enter the
              computer technology workforce or pursue high education in the field. Additional
              benefits of the program include: 1) enhancement of the undergraduate computer
              science curriculum; 2) increased collaboration with business and industry; 3)
              development of collaborations with the growing body of bio-medical and high
              tech industries in the city of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as well as state
              and national employers; 4) strengthen collaborations with the departments of
              mathematics, life sciences, physical sciences, and health sciences; 5) enhance
              the professional development of faculty resulting from mentoring scholars
              engaged in research.
