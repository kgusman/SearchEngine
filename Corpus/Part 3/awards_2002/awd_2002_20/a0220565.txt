Abstract    :
              Metabolic Engineering Conference IV is the fourth of a continuing conference
              series on the interdisciplinary field of metabolic engineering, and provides a
              new window into quantitative analysis and synthesis of metabolic networks. The
              increasing awareness of metabolic engineering in both the academic and
              industrial scene has been stimulated by some critical challenges of modern
              molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology. 

The two most important
              elements of metabolic engineering, quantitative physiology (analysis) and
              metabolic design (synthesis), are aimed to address these problems.  Concepts
              and methodologies of metabolic engineering have potential value in direct
              application of metabolic design of cellular systems for the degradation of
              recalcitrant pollutants, production processes, and cell-based and gene
              therapies, which could provide critical insight in many areas of
              medicine.
Themes to be discussed at this upcoming conference include:

1)
              Systems analysis in metabolic engineering
2) Metabolic engineering of cell
              cultures
3) Metabolic engineering of prokaryotes
4) Inverse metabolic
              engineering
5) Human metabolic systems biology
6) Metabolic engineering of
              quality traits in plants
7) Metabolic engineering of primary and secondary
              metabolites
8) Quantitative experimental analysis
9) Computational
              methods
10) Biocatalysts
11) High-throughput analysis
