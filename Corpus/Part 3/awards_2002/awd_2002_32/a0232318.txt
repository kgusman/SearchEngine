Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
              feasibility of a novel method,  Reactive Vapor Deposition (RVD), which is
              capable of mass producing thin-film, meso-porous and nano-phased cathode
              materials for use in lithium-ion and lithium-metal batteries. Theoretical
              calculations and a primitive bench-top set-up have given the initial indication
              that this highly versatile method could potentially produce various stable
              cathode materials at a high throughput rate and at low cost.  The Phase-I
              research is aimed at designing and building a bench-top RVD apparatus to
              demonstrate the general technical feasibility and commercial viability of this
              method as applied to the fabrication of nano-phased hybrid oxides for
              re-chargeable battery cathodes. 

The commercial applications and other
              benefits will be lower-cost and more stable lithium-ion and lithium-metal
              batteries. This could have a major impact on the markets of portable
              electronic, computer, and communications devices. The market demands for all
              types of rechargeable cells is expected to grow at a compound rate of 11% per
              year, reaching a total of 3 billion cells by 2005. The lithium ion cells are
              expected to capture a 20% market share with a total of $6 billion (based on a
              wholesale price of $10 per cell).  An even greater market size will become
              possible when much lower-cost and stable lithium-ion batteries are widely used
              in electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles.
