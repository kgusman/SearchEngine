Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
              the feasibility of a new manufacturing improvement, planning and execution
              system that combines the data of a supply chain management system with the
              incentives of the lean manufacturing philosophy along with the author's own
              Factory Physics knowledge base in a systematic manner.  The result will be a
              system containing implementation methods, training, and software that is
              repeatable, portable, and will always result in predictable, improved
              manufacturing logistical performance.  Understanding manufacturing measures
              such as cycle time, throughput, capacity, work in process, inventory, and
              variability allows one to develop effective control procedures that are
              uniquely suited for any particular manufacturing environment.  This project
              attempts to create a system that includes benchmarking (diagnostic) tools,
              analysis (planning) tools, and execution tools.  What makes the proposed
              approach different is Factory Physics, Inc.'s systematic way of improving the
              manufacturing operation and addressing the planning and control needs.
    
              The broader impact of this research will be a well-defined methodology to
              improve the effectiveness of production systems that can be marketed to the
              manufacturing sector.  In addition, using the system will result in
              better-educated manufacturing managers and engineers.
