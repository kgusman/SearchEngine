Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will research an
              advanced form of transparent network TCP proxies for both satellite and
              terrestrial broadband wireless communications to the Internet. Low cost shared
              wireless access links to the Internet often exhibit what we have called a
              traffic/cost anomaly. While almost 90% of the traffic in the network can flow
              from the Internet to the user, almost 90% of the cost of the access links can
              be attributed to the channel transmitting packets from the user to the
              Internet. Much of this cost can be directly attributed to the performance
              penalties imposed upon wireless access channels by the structure of
              conventional TCP protocols. The proxy to be developed will be designed to deal
              with these performance penalties with the objective of providing an improvement
              of 10x in the effective throughput of the multiple access channels.

 The
              broader impacts of the use of such proxies would be to make practical a cost
              effective broadband Internet access option for millions of users without such
              an option at this time.
