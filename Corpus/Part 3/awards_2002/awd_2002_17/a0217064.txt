Abstract    :
              Biological invasions represent a major component of global environmental
              change.
Invasions may lead to reduced biodiversity and often result in
              permanent alterations to
ecosystems.Invasive non-native plant pathogens have
              dramatically affected ecosystems in many
parts of the world.The mechanisms
              underlying dispersal of these pathogens and their ecological
consequences are
              critical issues for conservation and ecosystem management.Spatial pattern is
a
              fundamental property of disease dynamics because it reflects the genetic
              heterogeneity and
environmental forces acting on pathogen dispersal and life
              history.A multidisciplinary approach
is required to solve the challenges of
              1)incorporating fine-scale processes of pathogen dispersal
into
              landscape-level models and 2)integrating spatial variation in environmental
              factors and host
population genetics with disease incidence.
In this
              proposal,we describe research to analyze spatio-temporal dynamics
              of
Phytophthora ramorum,an emerging,and probably exotic,pathogen that causes a
              lethal disease
of oaks and tanoaks in coastal California.This disease,known as
              Sudden Oak Death (SOD),has
reached epidemic levels in several counties.The
              proposal integrates spatial data on host
genetics,community structure,and
              environmental variation with investigations of mechanisms
underlying spread of
              P.ramorum to model changes in the distribution of this plant disease
              across
the landscape.Model predictions will identify critical factors that
              influence the distribution of
SOD and provide forecasts of habitat loss in oak
              woodlands as a consequence of SOD.This
proposal describes a multidisciplinary
              program to model the spread of a destructive plant disease
and to predict its
              ecological consequences.Our objectives are not developed as
              discrete
activities for individual researchers,but rather a collaborative
              effort among researchers to attack
a single problem.We aim to accomplish the
              following:
1.Develop a statistically based model that predicts spatial
              patterns of SOD risk on the
landscape,based on relationships among several
              critical environmental factors.These factors
include proximity to previously
              infected locations,genetic background of host species,plant
community
              structure,landscape structure,abiotic conditions,and anthropogenic
              activities.
2.Develop a mechanistic model that predicts spatial patterns of
              pathogen activity and host
susceptibility based on empirical studies of
              pathogen dispersal between hosts on fine spatial
scales and on environmental
              conditions conducive to pathogen reproduction and dispersal.
3.Develop a model
              of SOD spread that integrates the most predictive components of
              the
statistical and mechanistic models.
4.Foster participation of
              undergraduates in this cross-disciplinary research and integrate the
research
              into the curriculum of core courses in the Departments of Biology and Geography
              at
Sonoma State University.
Sonoma State University is located within 20 km
              of the study area,which is easily
accessible to PI s and their
              students.Previous analyses of the relationship between
environmental variation
              and SOD spread have concentrated on the most heavily impacted
regions in Marin
              County where the pathogen has infected trees throughout the study
              area.In
contrast,the present study focuses on SOD spread into new areas that
              presently show no sign of
infection.We believe that this approach will
              contribute substantially towards a greater
understanding of the biology of
              this pathogen and to our understanding of the ecology and
genetics of
              plant-pathogen interactions.The timing of this study will also ensure
              involvement by
motivated undergraduates at Sonoma State University who wish to
              participate in research that
everyone recognizes is of critical significance
              to the larger community.
