The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake
              Engineering Simulation (NEES) is a project funded under the National Science
              Foundation Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account. This
              cooperative agreement, awarded under NEES, establishes a NEES large high
              performance (LHP) outdoor shake table site at the University of California, San
              Diego (UCSD) and is an outcome of the peer review of proposals submitted to
              program solicitation NSF 01-164,  "NEES: Earthquake Engineering Research
              Equipment, Phase 2."  This outdoor shake table will be a 7.6 m x 12.2 m long
              single (horizontal) degree-of-freedom system. The table will have a peak
              horizontal velocity of 1.8 m/s, maximum stroke of +/-0.75 m, maximum gravity
              (vertical) payload of 200 MN, maximum overturning moment of 50 MN-m, force
              capacity of actuators of 6.8 MN, and a frequency bandwidth from 0-20 Hz.  The
              major equipment for the LHP shake table facility consists of servocontrolled
              dynamically-rated actuators with large-servo valves, a large power supply, a
              vertical load/overturning moment bearing system, a digital three-variable
              real-time controller, concrete foundation and reaction mass, and
              weatherproofing system.  The facility will be the only outdoor shake table in
              the U.S. and will enable large/full-scale testing of structural systems and
              soil-foundation-structure interaction that cannot be readily extrapolated from
              testing at smaller scale, or under quasi-static or pseudo-dynamic test
              conditions, as well as testing large-scale systems to observe their response
              under near source ground motion.  The LHP outdoor shake table will be located
              15 km from campus at the UCSD Camp Elliott field site.  This two-acre site was
              selected so that the shake table could be used in conjunction with an adjacent
              soil pit and laminar shear soil box being provided by the California Department
              of Transportation.  This site will allow room for multiple test specimens to be
              constructed and instrumented before placement on the shake table. A 177 kN
              rough terrain crane will be provided at Camp Elliott for loading, unloading,
              and everyday construction purposes.  For heavier lifting capabilities, an 880
              kN crane will be available on an as needed rental basis, with the individual
              experiment requiring the larger crane to cover this cost.  This equipment will
              be operational by September 30, 2004, and will be managed as a national
              shared-use NEES equipment site, with teleobservation and teleoperation
              capabilities, to provide new earthquake engineering research testing
              capabilities through 2014.  Shared-use access and training will be coordinated
              through the NEES Consortium. UCSD is providing $1,363,000 in cost sharing for
              this facility. UCSD will integrate this shake table equipment into its research
              program involving undergraduate and graduate students, Department of Structural
              Engineering curriculum, and K-12 and general public outreach.  The University
              will also provide training opportunities for outside faculty, students, and
              practitioners through web-based tutorials and on-site training.
