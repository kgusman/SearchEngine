Abstract    :
              Over the past ten years, the use of video surveillance technologies has become
              widespread. These technologies are increasingly used by government and
              corporate institutions to monitor individuals in public or quasi-public spaces
              with a view to enhancing personal and property security, productivity,
              efficiency, and peace of mind. The interaction between video surveillance
              technologies and human actors raises
complex questions. An in-depth inquiry
              into the driving forces behind the use of these technologies and their
              implications on personal autonomy, human agency and privacy in general would
              lead to a better understanding of the interaction between technology and the
              social landscape. This dissertation research project will explore theoretical
              aspects of the video surveillance-privacy nexus, and by means of qualitative
              inquiry will investigate the lived, contextual experiences of (a) "the
              watchers"-- those who own, operate, install, and use video surveillance systems
              focusing on social control issues, and (b)"the watched"--those who are subject
              to video surveillance systems with specific attention to issues of personal
              autonomy and human agency. Funding is provided to conduct a series of
              interviews with people who are using video surveillance techniques, and to
              analyze these transcripts in order to see how questions of privacy, power and
              the benefits of  the technology are being conceptualized. By investigating how
              and why the particular configurations of video surveillance have emerged, the
              proposed research will contribute to the literature on the centrality of visual
              technologies to social control mechanisms, and the understanding of privacy in
              terms of its philosophical dimensions.
