The study of compact  irreducible 3-manifolds
              splits naturally
into cases of finite fundamental groups and infinite
              fundamental
groups. In the case of  infinite fundamental groups, the
              virtual
Haken conjecture of Waldhausen has been serving as a guiding
              open
problem, because virtual Haken 3-manifolds possess similar
              nice
properties as Haken 3-manifolds, such as topological
              rigidity,
residually finite fundamental groups and geometric decomposition
in
              Thurston's sense. Concerning 3-manifolds with finite
fundamental groups, the
              Poincare conjecture is perhaps the most 
fundamental open problem. The well
              known Property-P conjecture 
may be considered as a special case of the
              Poincare conjecture. 
Xingru Zhang proposes to continue his investigation of
              the virtual
Haken conjecture and the Property-P conjecture, along with some
              
closely related problems, such as embedded or immersed essential 
surfaces
              in 3-manifolds, various exceptional Dehn surgeries on 
hyperbolic knots, and
              representations of 3-manifold groups.

Three dimensional manifold topology,
              including the knot theory,
has been one of the most active research areas in
              topology over 
the last twenty-five years. This is a rich, beautiful and
              
challenging area where  topology meshes up harmonically with 
algebra and
              geometry. For instance, if a compact 3-manifold 
without boundary admits a
              complete  hyperbolic metric, then the 
topology, the fundamental group and the
              hyperbolic metric  of the 
manifold mutually determine each other. In general,
              it is 
fundamental to know that to what extent the topology of a compact
              
3-manifold is determined by the fundamental group of the manifold,
and that
              whether the interior of a compact 3-manifold admits one 
of the eight standard
               complete metrics under the condition that 
the manifold contains no essential
              2-spheres or 2-tori. In this 
proposal the PI plans to continue his
              investigation in this 
direction.
