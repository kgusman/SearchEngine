This proposal consists of a number of research
              projects on the topic
of  cohomology theories for orbifolds and related
              subjects. The suggested
methods combine algebraic topology with
              techniques
coming from stack theory in algebraic geometry and tools
              arising
in symplectic geometry. It proposes the  use of the theory
              of
groupoids as a unifying tool in the solution these questions;
              a
methodology that has proved successful before in our study of
orbifolds.
              The following is a brief summary of some aspects of the 
project. The first
              project is  program whose objective is
the study of the cohomological
              invariants that can be naturally
obtained from several natural spaces
              associated to an orbifold. A
second project consist of a study the orbifold
              elliptic genus, 
its modularity and rigidity properties from the homotopy
              
theory point of view. The third project describes a program to 
define and
              study Orbifold Deligne cohomologies and their relation 
to gerbes defined over
              the orbifold. The fourth is a project to study 
the relation between the
              Hodge-Deligne numbers of an orbifold 
resolution of singularities of an
              orbifold and the original orbifold. 

Orbifolds are geometric spaces in which
              it is very important to keep track
of the local symmetries of the particular
              situation. So in general the
points
of an orbifold are classified by the
              amount of local symmetry. In ordinary
spaces all points are equal, while in an
              orbifold points carry different
weights corresponding to the amount of local
              symmetry. Orbifolds have been
used in the study of structural crystallography
              allowing for a convenient
book-keeping device by reducing the  redundant
              information in the space 
group diagrams of the crystallographic groups.
              Orbifolds have also become
extremely important in the field of theoretical
              physics referred to as
Superstring
theory. In String Theory, the multitude of
              particle types of classical
high 
energy physics is replaced by a single
              fundamental building block, a
`string'.
As the string moves through time it
              traces out a tube or a sheet,
according 
to whether it is closed or open.
              Moreover,  the string can vibrate, and 
different vibrational modes of the
              string represent the different particle 
types, since different modes are seen
              as different masses or spins. In an 
attempt to make these theories describe
              the physical universe, physicists
have
been motivated to let the string move
              on an orbifold space. In these cases
the
theory acquires properties that are
              very desirable for it to model
reality. 
The work proposed in this project
              involves the development of rigorous
mathematical methods to study the
              geometry of these spaces.
