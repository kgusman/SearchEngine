Proposer plans to investigate the topology of
              smooth 4-manifolds by 
decomposing them into  Stein pieces which are easy to
              understand 
(since they turn out to be Lefschetz fibrations over the 2-disk).
              He 
would like use the techniques of complex and symplectic manifolds to
              
understand the restriction this decomposition imposes to the topology 
of
              the original manifold. Proposer hopes to apply these techniques to 
attack
              some unsolved problems of 4-dimensional topology, such as 
finding
              4-dimensional fake s-cobordisms,  and to the problem of 
constructing a fake
              S^3 x S^1. Proposer also plans to work on the 
topological problems arising
              from complex algebraic geometry, such as 
problems coming from the complex
              conjugation, branched covers and the 
curve counting problem in real algebraic
              geometry.

Proposer plans to investigate structure of 4-dimensional manifolds
              by 
decomposing them into pieces that are topologically easier to 
understand
              (4-manifolds are spaces which locally look like 
4-dimensional Euclidean
              space-time we live in). These smaller pieces 
carry certain `natural complex
              structures' which analytical 
techniques apply. By these techniques Principal
              investigator hopes to 
construct certain 4-manifolds believed to exists but
              not yet have 
been found. One of the reasons 4-manifolds are of interest is
              because 
of the physicists model of the 10-dimensional universe which consists
              
of a 4-dimensional space-time plus 6-dimensional complex piece.
