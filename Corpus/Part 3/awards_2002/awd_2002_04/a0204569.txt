Title: The Method of
              Alternating Projections

The method of alternating projections (MAP) is an
              iterative procedure for determining nearest points from a set that is the
              intersection of a finite number of closed convex sets. This method has found
              use in at least 15 different areas of mathematics, which includes solving
              linear equations and inequalities, signal analysis, and computed tomography.
              The main practical drawback of the MAP, at least for some applications, is its
              slow convergence. We will study rates of convergence for the MAP by extending
              the notion of ``angle'' between subspaces to that of more general convex sets,
              as well as determine means for accelerating the convergence of the MAP. In
              addition, we expect to show that the speed of convergence of the MAP is
              directly related to a property (the ``strong conical hull intersection''
              property) of the convex sets in question that we have studied in several papers
              over the last 20 years. 

The method of alternating projections is an
              algorithm for computing nearest points in certain sets by a repetitive
              application of the same few simple steps. Since the method has  applications to
              so many different areas of mathematics (one of the earliest being in medical
              imaging via X-rays), it is important to know how fast (i.e., how many steps)
              this algorithm needs to take before  the results give good accuracy of the
              exact solution. The ``rate of convergence'' of the algorithm deals with the
              question of how fast the algorithm is for any given problem. For those problems
              when the rate of convergence is slow, we will also study ways to  make the
              algorithm work faster by making appropriate modifications of certain steps in
              the algorithm.
