The
              proposed research focuses on various aspects of the inner
model theory and can
              be divided into two areas. The first area
puts emphasis on the determining the
              internal structure of
extender models, fine structure theory and
              infinitary
combinatorics. The PI has done extensive research here,
              making
substantial contributions to the existing results. Extender
models are
              generalizations of Goedel's constructible universe
which admit a very complex
              structure of large cardinal
axioms. The key element behind the inner model
              theory is
iterability -- a method which enables us to iterate
              countable
structures that are elementarily embeddable into initial
              segments
of these models. Granting iterability, the author and
              his
collaborators were able to develop a fine structure theory of
these
              models, which is a means enabling to investigate the
internal structure and
              combinatorics (Jensen's principles) of
these models abstractly, without any
              direct reference to
iterability. The aim of this project is to extend the
              existing
methods in a manner that would yield the complete description
              of
combinatorial properties of extender models. The open problems
are related
              mainly to cardinal transfer theorems and stationary
reflection. This part of
              the project includes also direct
applications of the inner model theory in
              determining the
consistency strength of various principles from
              infinitary
combinatorics. The focus here is on improving the PI's results
              on
Jensen's guessing principle. The second part of the project
consists of
              two areas that are less tightly related to the PI's
past research, namely the
              construction of inner models,
iterability and applications in the descriptive
              set theory.

The subject of set theory is the analysis of methods which
              arise
in mathematics. The methods that are widely accepted by
              the
mathematical world have been formalized into so-called
Zermelo-Fraenkel
              system of axioms (briefly ZFC). However, it
turns out that we more and more
              often encouter questions whose
solutions require more than mere ZFC. Set
              theory provides us with
tools for recognizing such problems and approaches
              which enable
us to determine which methods to use. More precisely, set
              theory
provides us with a general method for determining the complexity
of
              various problems quantitatively. The scale used here is the
hierarchy of the
              large cardinal axioms. Extender models play a
crucial role here -- there are
              the actual technical means which
enables us to establish the connection
              between various concrete
problems from mathematics and large cardinal
              axioms.
