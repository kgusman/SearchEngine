The PI proposes three projects.  In
              the first, the PI proposes to
study regularity of harmonic maps into the
              completion of Teichmueller
space.  The two main applications are on symplectic
              Lefschetz pencils
and on superrigidity of lattices in the mapping class group.
               In the
second project the PI proposes a proof of higher dimensional
              partial
analogues of the conjectures of Atiyah and Bott on
              Yang-Mills
equations over Riemann surfaces.  These are
              nontrivial
generalizations to higher dimensions of the PI's previous work on
              the
connection between Yang-Mills and the theory of holomorphic
              vector
bundles.  Finally in the third project the PI proposes some
              questions
about harmonic maps from three-dimensional manifolds to trees
              which
generalize the well-known theory of harmonic maps from surfaces.

The
              motivation for the first project is to use harmonic maps in order
to
              understand analytically the results of Kaimanovich-Masur and
Farb-Masur on the
              superrigidity of lattices of rank at least 2 in the
mapping class group.  In
              the process the PI realized that the methods
should also shed light in the
              rank one case.  The second project
shows that there are still very close
              connections between the
analysis of the Yang-Mills equations and algebraic
              geometry.  These
connections have been exploited in great detail by several
              people in
the case of Riemann surfaces but very little is known in
              higher
dimensions.  The PI's work sheds some light in this direction.
