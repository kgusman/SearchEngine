Abstract    :
              
The PI plans to establish rigidity and finiteness results for
infinite
              groups, both in geometric and dynamical contexts.  In an
attempt to broaden
              the scope of rigidity as initiated by Mostow,
Margulis, Zimmer and others, we
              aim at results for very general
(finitely generated) groups, notably
              fundamental groups arising
in geometry.  The proposed methods are however also
              new and
relevant for the more classical study of arithmetic and
S-arithmetic
              groups.  There are three aspects to the project.
The first is to construct
              cohomological invariants characterizing
various geometric situations; a
              typical example is the
interpretation of negative curvature in terms of
              bounded
cohomology that we propose with Shalom.  The second step is
              to
develop a suitable theory to handle these invariants in an
efficient way,
              notably by using tools from ergodic theory.  Last,
one has to apply this to
              concrete situations.  We focus in
particular on superrigidity and cocycle
              superrigidity for
non-linear groups and on orbit equivalence of ergodic
              actions.

The last forty years have witnessed the birth and
              remarkable
development of what is now called ''rigidity theory''.  The
              first
discovery in that field was this: Even though a flat space (which
is
              the kind of space one thought we live in, from the ancient
Greeks to Newton)
              can be deformed in many ways, some curved
spaces (whose relevance to our world
              has been discovered by
Einstein) are in a sense rigid.  Later came a discovery
              regarded
as yet much more fundamental: The most symmetric geometric
              spaces
turn out to be in fact arithmetic objects.  The project
              under
consideration here is to broaden the scope this rigidity theory
to many
              more geometric spaces, and especially to deal with
situations in which the
              geometry cannot be reduced to
arithmetics.  Actually, we propose new methods
              that stand out by
their abstract nature and allow us to tackle situations
              which do
not even stem from geometry, but rather regard the study
              of
dynamics.  (Dynamics is the theory of systems that evolve in
time,
              typically ocean currents or galaxies, and may have chaotic
behaviours.)  Our
              project proposes new methods for obtaining more
results both in this dynamical
              setting and in geometry, and this
in a unified way.
