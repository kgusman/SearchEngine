The project will study the
              geometry of knots which are critical
configurations for "ropelength", which is
              defined to be the quotient
of their length over the radius of their largest
              embedded tubular
neighborhood. Since the ropelength functional is not smooth,
              there is
no classical Euler-Lagrange equation describing the minimizers. 
              The
primary aim of the projec666t is to provide an analogy to
              the
Euler-Lagrange equation: a "balance criterion", which shows that a
curve
              is ropelength critical if and only if the first variation of the
length of the
              core curve can be balanced by a system of self-contact
forces acting on the
              surrounding tube. The methods used to prove the
balance criterion (a
              generalization of certain aspects of tensegrity
theory to a class of
              "continuous tensegrities", using a version of the
Farkas alternative theorem
              for linear operators on Banach spaces)
promise rich applications in other
              areas of mathematics, such as the
study of convex curves, and of "knot
              energies".

A natural model for a rope with a circular cross-section is a
              space
curve surrounded by a non-self-intersecting tube of fixed radius. 
              If
such a rope is tied in a knot, and the knot is pulled tight, the
resulting
              curve is a critical configuration for the "ropelength" of
the curve, which is
              defined to be the quotient of the length of the
curve over the radius of the
              tube. The project studies the geometry of
ropelength-critical curves using
              ideas from the theory of frameworks.
This theory studies simple engineering
              models of structures, and gives
a precise description of how external loads on
              a structure are
resolved into tensions and compressions of different
              structural
elements.  The project views the tension in a tight knot as
              exerting a
force directed towards the inside of each curve of the rope, and
              aims
to show that such a curve is tight if this force can be resolved into
a
              system of self-contact forces acting on the surface of the tube.
This "balance
              criterion" has surprising consequences. Imagine a rope
stretched horizontally,
              like a clothesline. If another rope is passed
over the line, and pulled down
              until the pair is tight, the ropes form
four straight segments joined to a
              central region where the strands
curve around one another. One would expect
              the ropes to maintain
contact throughout this curved clasp, with the two
              points on the
inside of each bend touching one another. However, according to
              the
balance criterion, this cannot happen: there is always a small
              gap
between the two strands at the center of the turn. This model has
already
              been used in molecular biology to describe the behavior of DNA
strands; the
              new geometric information provided by the project will
help to refine and
              extend many other appications of this model in
physics, biology, and
              engineering.
