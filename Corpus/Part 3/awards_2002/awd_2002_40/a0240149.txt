Abstract    :
              A recently developed instrument called the Rain Imaging System (RIS) offers
              promise of an improved capability of measuring the size, shape, and spatial
              concentration of raindrops.  This information is critical for precipitation
              physics and certain applications in atmospheric remote sensing.  Developed by
              NASA, RIS consists basically of a halogen light source and a CCD camera
              separated by a distance of 4 m.  It records the forward-scattering image of
              individual drops as they fall through the scattering volume using a very short
              exposure time to "freeze" the drops in position and eliminate smearing of the
              image.  Drops are counted and measured as they fall in the focal region of the
              camera.  The size of the depth of field is crucial, because it determines the
              volume in which drops are measured.  Drops within the focal region are
              identifiable as dark silhouettes with the light source appearing as a "hole"
              within them.  Drops outside the focal region do not have the hole.  Knowing the
              distance of the focal region from the camera enables determination of drop size
              from the image size.  In a typical setup, the system has the camera lens
              focused at a distance of 2 m with an aperture of f/8.  With these settings the
              camera images a region nominally 32 mm x 24 mm in cross section with a 175 mm
              depth of field.  The purpose of this project is to evaluate and quantify the
              performance of RIS using laboratory-generated water drops of known size dropped
              through different parts of the focal volume.  The experiments will determine
              (1) the smallest drop measurable by RIS and its dependence on position in the
              focal region; (2) the 3-D shape of the focal region and its possible dependence
              on drop size and position; (3) the accuracy with which RIS can measure drop
              size and shape.  Answers to these questions will document the performance of
              RIS and enable the improvement of data processing algorithms.  The work will be
              carried out at Clemson University in collaboration with Dr. Larry Bliven of
              NASA, who originally developed the instrument.
