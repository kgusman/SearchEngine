This grant supports a theoretical project investigating
              surface electrochemistry.  Surface electrochemistry contributes to the welfare
              of society in many ways, including metal production, electroplating, corrosion
              protection, energy storage, and heterogeneous catalysis for the chemical and
              pharmaceutical industries and environmental protection.  Despite these diverse
              and economically important applications, it is only in the last two decades
              that experimental methods have become available that permit observation and
              manipulation of electrode/electrolyte interfaces on an atomic scale without
              removing the electrode to an ultra-high vacuum environment.  These new,
              nanoscopic in situ methods include scanning probe microscopies, such as
              scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and X-ray
              diffraction using high-brilliance synchrotron sources.  In combination with the
              traditional, macroscopic methods of electrochemistry, such as cyclic
              voltammetry and chronocoulometry, these new techniques have ushered in a new
              era of atomic-scale electrochemical surface science.  As a consequence,
              electrochemical methods to manufacture high-tech materials and devices that
              derive their properties from structure on the nanometer scale are being
              developed and have the potential to become cost-effective alternatives to
              current high-vacuum techniques.  These impressive experimental developments are
              paralleled by spectacular progress in computer hardware and software. 
              Calculations that required supercomputers a decade ago are now performed on
              personal computers, while today's fastest computers and algorithms can handle
              billions of atoms.

This research will apply results and techniques from
              recent NSF-supported computational and theoretical studies of dynamical
              phenomena in electrochemical materials science to study the dynamics of anions
              that are electrochemically adsorbed on single-crystal electrodes.  These
              results and techniques include theoretical models for specific electrochemical
              systems, highly efficient dynamic multiscale simulation algorithms, and ab
              initio quantum mechanical methods.  The methods will be used and developed
              further in investigations of halides electrochemically adsorbed on silver and
              gold, and the dynamics of phase transformations of gold surfaces under rapidly
              pulsed potential.  The results will be compared with experiments in
              collaboration with experimental groups.  In addition to studies of specific
              systems, the research will include work of more general scope on effects of
              diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the adsorbate structure, on dynamics of
              adsorbate systems under conditions of rapidly varying electrode potentials, and
              on methods to include the effects of electric fields and to explicitly include
              water molecules in ab initio calculations.

Work will also continue to
              develop simulation algorithms that faithfully represent the effects of
              adsorption, desorption, and lateral diffusion that occur on atomic time scales
              of less that 10-10 seconds, while enabling simulation of processes on a scale
              of seconds or longer.  This problem of bridging time scales will be addressed
              in a hierarchical manner, using studies of small continuum systems to determine
              parameters for input in simulations that can reach macroscopic times with the
              application of modern algorithms.

This research is expected to result in
              improved understanding of nonequilibrium processes at electrode/electrolyte
              interfaces, and thereby contribute to the development of new,
              electrochemistry-based processes to manufacture nanoparticles, ultrathin films,
              and other nanostructured materials.  The research is ideal for involving
              students at all levels in the discovery process.
