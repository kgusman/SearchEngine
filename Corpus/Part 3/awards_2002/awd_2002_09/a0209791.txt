Abstract    :
              Post-transcriptional processing of mRNA is an important mechanism of gene
              regulation.  This project is concerned with 3'-processing of mRNA, a process
              that includes cleavage of the precursor RNA sequence and subsequent
              polyadenylation.  3'-processing sites are determined by cis-acting signal
              elements, short control sequences within the immature precursor mRNA.  The
              signals in yeast have been well characterized, but those in Arabidopsis have
              only begun to identify the precise sequence and positioning characteristics of
              the required cis-elements.

Alternative 3'-processing of a specific mRNA,
              similar to alternative splicing, is a mechanism for regulating the sequence of
              the mature mRNA.  Unlike alternative splicing, however, alternative
              3'-processing typically changes only the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the
              mRNA, leaving the protein coding sequence unaltered.  Variation of the 3'-UTR
              sequence results in altered regulatory elements specific to the 3'-UTR, such as
              mRNA stability, translation, or localization elements. 
 
The specific goals
              of this are project are: (1) establishment of a curated database of
              experimentally determined 3'-processing sites for Arabidopsis, (2) construction
              of a discrete state-space model (DSM) based predictive tool for Arabidopsis
              mRNA 3'-processing sites, and (3) creation of a freely accessible web server
              interface to both the database and the predictive tools.  DSM models are a form
              of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), in which the model structure is manually, rather
              than automatically, designed.  DSM based models have previously been used to
              predict 3'-processing sites in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has
              3'-processing control elements similar to those found in plants.  

Public
              access to predictive tools will make it possible for external researchers to
              analyze any gene or group of genes of interest, even in the absence of
              experimentally determined sites in the curated database.  Prediction of
              3'-processing sites can also be coupled with gene prediction software to make
              the prediction more complete, including probable 3'-UTR sequences.  The web
              site is:  http://bmerc-www.bu.edu/polyA/.
