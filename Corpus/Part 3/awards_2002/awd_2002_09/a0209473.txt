Abstract    :
              A whole array of questions in different mathematical areas seem
to be converge
              to questions having to do with the set of alcoves
in a fixed Weyl chamber of a
              semisimple Lie group. The areas
include Kac-Moody theory, homology of loop
              groups, quantum
cohomology, the Verlinde algebra, MacDonald identities,
              Schubert
calculus, ideals in the Borel subalgebra, symmetric space theory
and
              the Cartan-Weyl representation theory of compact Lie
groups. In effect our
              proposal is to sort out what is going on to
unify what seems to us to be
              unifiable in the subjects listed
above.

Group theory, and especially Lie
              group theory, lies at the heart
of mathematics and the application of
              mathematics to problems in
the real world. Included in the latter are
              applications to both
classical and quantum mechanics, control theory, string
              theory,
chemistry and crystallography. Lie group theory is
              extremely
intricate and the extent to which it is applicable depends
              highly
on a knowledge of its intricacies. The proposed project expects
to
              discover highly exciting new structures in the subject and
would unify many
              existing structures. The effect that would be to
greatly increase our
              understanding and our ability to use these
powerful structures.  This award is
              jointly funded by the programs
in Geometric Analysis and Algebra, Number
              Theory, & Combinatorics.
