     In this project, the investigator and his students
              study
improved interior-point algorithms for convex, especially
second-order
              and semidefinite, programming problems.  In
particular, they investigate
              finding more accurate solutions to
large-scale problems of this kind,
              interpreting the output of
infeasible-interior-point methods as searching for
              infeasibility
certificates when applied to infeasible problems, using ideas
              of
Riemannian geomentry to develop new interior-point methods for
possibly
              infeasible problems, and studying new barrier functions
to be used in highly
              asymmetric problems, where usual primal-only
or primal-dual methods would be
              inefficient.  All these ideas are
tested out by implementing them in the
              software package SDPT3,
developed by the investigator and two of his
              collaborators, which
is a competitive primal-dual code available over the
              internet (e.g., at
http://www.math.cmu.edu/~reha/sdpt3.html) and within the
              NEOS 
system (http://www-neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/server-solvers.html)
for
              distributed computing.
     Interior-point algorithms are a new and
              exciting
computational method for solving large-scale resource allocation
and
              other optimization problems.  For example, they have been
used to develop
              better designs for truss structures, such as
bridges, that are better able to
              resist a wide range of external
loads.  Another application is the design of
              antenna arrays to
highlight the receptivity in certain directions while muting
              that
in all other directions.  In finance, they are used to develop
"optimal
              portfolios" to balance an acceptable rate of return with
low volatility
              (unfortunately, these methods are only as good as
the data they employ, and
              past history often does not give a good
indication of future performance).  In
              this and other contexts,
the idea of robust optimization, to find solutions to
              problems
that satisfy all constraints even when the data are perturbed
              a
little, and that give good performance measures even when the
data are
              slightly changed, is very attractive, and this class of
methods is successful
              in treating some problems of this kind
also.  A last application mentioned
              here is currently being
studied by the investigator and a statistics
              colleague: trying to
find a good way to classify new data into one of two
              classes
(e.g., with or without a cancerous tumour) on the basis of
              some
training data (with known classification).  This problem is of
interest
              in data mining and biomedical fields.  In all these
problems, there is a
              desire to solve larger and larger instances
(involving tens of thousands of
              variables and constraints) more
and more accurately.  The investigator and his
              collaborators
study theoretically and practically ways to improve
              existing
algorithms to extend their capabilities in these directions.
