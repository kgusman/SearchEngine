Abstract    :
              Plant growth, development, and survival depend on the uptake, translocation, and
              sorting of 15 essential nutrients and countless metabolites to specific organs,
              cells and intracellular compartments.  However, it is not known how plants
              regulate and coordinate the complex network of long-distance and cellular
              transport patterns.  The first complete genome sequence of a plant, large
              mutant collections, and extensive databases provide opportunities to generate
              new resources and tools to discover the functions of ~800 transporters in
              Arabidopsis.  The bulk of unknown transporters are secondary active
              transporters.  The major objectives of this project are to determine the ion
              specificity, the tissue and subcellular distribution, and the biological roles
              of 56 H+-coupled cation transporters, including the CaCA, CPA1, and CPA2
              families. With the availability of genomic sequence and the identification of
              transport homologs through bioinformatic analyses, heterologous expression in
              yeast will be used to quickly delineate the function of the entire complement
              of H+-coupled cation transporters.  Regulatory mechanisms will be determined by
              mutation of putative autoinhibitory domains.  Transport in isolated membranes
              will be used to verify ion specificity of representative transporters.  Tissue
              and subcellular distribution will be determined using promoter-reporter
              proteins expression in transgenic plants, and GFP-tagged transporters in a
              protoplast model.  Biological and physiological functions of transporters will
              be analyzed using insertional knockout mutants.  New methods and information
              resulting from the study will be distributed through a site at
              http://www.cbs.umn.edu/2010 with several updates each year.  To assure that
              results and resources are available to the community, data will be depositied
              at TAIR and mutant Arabidopsis lines will be available through the ABRC after
              results are confirmed.
Transporters impact all life processes, including
              reproduction, metabolism, movement, and responses to hormonal and environmental
              stimuli, thus resources and information generated from this project will
              directly facilitate progress towards the goals of the 2010 project.  Programs
              are in place to attract and provide opportunities for students, including
              under-represented minorities, to solve problems in health, agriculture, and the
              environment using experimental and bioinformatic approaches.
