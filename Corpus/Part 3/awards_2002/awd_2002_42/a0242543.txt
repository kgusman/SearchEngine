     The broad goal of this project is to gain a
              mechanistic
understanding of energy transduction in biomolecular
              transport
processes.  The project focuses on three specific systems:
              the
bacterial flagellar motor, the motor protein dynein, and
              protein
translocation systems found in membranes of the endoplasmic
reticulum
              and mitochondria.  While the biology involved in these
systems is very
              different, the same mathematical techniques are
applicable for analyzing
              theoretical models of all three.  To
model these systems requires the use of
              Langevin or stochastic
differential equations.  The randomness in these
              equations comes
from two sources, thermal diffusion and chemical
              kinetics.
Thermal fluctuations are characterized by the
              diffusion
coefficient, which can be measured experimentally, and many of
the
              important reaction rates are known from biochemical studies.
In addition to
              molecular collisions, electrostatic interactions
are the other dominant forces
              involved in these transport
systems.  If available, structural data are used
              to determine the
relevant electrostatic potentials.  Once model equations for
              the
systems have been developed, numerical and analytical techniques
are used
              to compare their behavior with experimental data.  The
final phase of the
              analysis is to use the mathematical models to
produce experimentally testable
              predictions.
     Biological molecular motors are nanometer-sized engines
              that
use chemical energy to generate force.  A well known molecular
motor is
              myosin, which is the protein responsible for muscle
contraction.  Other
              examples include the flagellar motor, which is
used by bacteria for swimming,
              and dynein, which produces the
force necessary for cilia motion.  The broad
              goal of this project
is to gain a mechanistic understanding of force
              generation in
both these systems.  Current experimental techniques are
              allowing
biophysicists to study molecular motors at the single
              molecule
level, thereby allowing the mechanical properties of motor
proteins
              to be measured.  These new physical data in conjunction
with structural data
              provide the impetus for renewed theoretical
investigations into molecular
              motor function.  An important reason
for performing a mathematical analysis of
              force generation is
that it allows a quantitative comparison between
              experimental
data and model behavior to be made.  The results of such
              a
comparison not only are important for model validation, but also
can be
              used to uncover errors in the assumptions underlying the
model.  However, the
              significance of mathematical modeling goes
beyond model validation and lies in
              its predictive power.  Once a
theoretical model has been developed that is
              consistent with
current experimental data, it is straightforward to extend
              the
analysis to include situations that have not yet been
investigated in the
              laboratory.  If model predictions are borne
out by experiment, further
              confidence in the reality of the model
is gained.  For the systems under
              consideration in this project,
this means a mechanistic understanding of force
              generation has
been achieved.  From a technological standpoint, the results
              of
these investigations should be relevant for designing and
fabricating
              manmade nanomachines.
