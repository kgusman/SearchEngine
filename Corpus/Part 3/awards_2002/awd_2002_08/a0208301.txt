Abstract

The Department of Statistics, and its Center
              for Reliability and Quality Sciences, at the University of South Carolina in
              Columbia will organize the International Conference on Reliability and Survival
              Analysis 2003 (ICRSA2003) to be held on the University's historic campus from
              May 21-24, 2003. The objectives of this conference are to bring together senior
              and established researchers and young and promising researchers from around the
              world who are working in the theoretical and applied aspects of reliability,
              survival analysis, and related topics in order to share recent advances and
              current research, as well as future research trends, in these areas. Through
              this conference, it is expected that interaction and/or collaborative work
              among reliability and survival analysis researchers will be fostered, which
              will enhance and accelerate developments in both areas. As it currently exists,
              the reliability and survival analysis disciplines have developed somewhat
              separately, but there is much to be gained by recognizing similarities between
              them since both deal with the stochastic modeling and statistical analysis of
              failure-time data, usually in the presence of incomplete information. This
              conference, which will be the first since 1998 to be held in the United States
              focused simultaneously on reliability and survival analysis, will enable many
              researchers in the United States to participate, especially new researchers and
              graduate students, as the cost and accessibility for participation is more
              viable.  Plenary talks and invited talks will be given by leading researchers
              in reliability and survival analysis, and contributed talks and poster sessions
              will be solicited from advanced graduate students and new researchers,
              especially from under-represented groups. The funding provided by the National
              Science Foundation will enable partial financial support of the plenary
              speakers, new researchers, and graduate students. New researchers and graduate
              students from under-represented groups will be particularly encouraged to seek
              funding from this NSF support.
