The high solubility of H2O in olivine and its
              high-pressure polymorphs, wadsleyite and ringwoodite has led to a great deal of
              interest in the effects of H2O in the upper mantle and transition zone. Recent
              interpretations of double seismic zones (Peacock, 2001) suggest that subducting
              oceanic lithosphere may also carry H2O into the mantle and possibly the
              transition zone. H2O in subducting lithosphere is likely to have profound
              effects on phase transformation mechanisms and kinetics as well as on
              deformation mechanism and resulting fabrics. It is likely that the presence of
              H2O, as hydrogen in olivine, will influence olivine-ringwoodite transformation
              mechanisms and enhance reaction rates. The investigators propose to perform
              kinetic transformation experiments in a multi-anvil apparatus using deuterated
              San Carlos olivine. They will use the widths of reaction rims to determine
              growth rates as a function of temperature, pressure and D2O content. TEM will
              be used to characterize transformation mechanisms in the deuterated olivine.
              D2O contents of the hot-pressed starting material and the transformed material
              will be determined with SIMS.
H2O has also been shown to have a great
              influence on the plastic deformation of olivine. Jung and Karato (2001) show
              that the fabric produced in simple shear at high pressure changes with
              increasing H2O content. TEM will be used to characterize the dislocation
              microstructures, slip systems and deformation mechanisms in olivine, wadsleyite
              and ringwoodite deformed at high pressure under wet conditions.
