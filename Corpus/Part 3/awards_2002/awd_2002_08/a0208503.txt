Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Natural hybridization and its
              consequences on the organization of genetic variation and population genetics
              of a crop and its wild relative."  Hybridization between 2 genetically distinct
              natural populations can result in new genetic combinations through the
              reassortment of genes and multilocus genotypes.  This study examines the
              evolutionary consequences of hybridization in co-occurring populations of maize
              (corn) and its wild relative teosinte by comparing genetic markers across the
              genome and among hybridizing and non-hybridizing populations.
