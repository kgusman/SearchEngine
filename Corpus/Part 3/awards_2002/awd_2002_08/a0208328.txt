Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Influence of mating system on
              patterns of parentage and fitness correlates in a garter snake model,
              Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis."  This research explores the role of kin
              recognition in the mating system by asking whether parental relatedness
              influences paternal contribution and, in turn, maternal fitness in natural
              populations of the red-sided garter snake.  This constitutes the first test for
              the presence of kin recognition and first rigorous study of inbreeding
              depression in any snake species.
