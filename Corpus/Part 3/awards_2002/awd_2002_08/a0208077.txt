Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Understanding how the TAR
              binding protein (TDP43) regulates alternative splicing of messenger RNA." 
              Alternative splicing during mRNA processing greatly contributes to generate the
              protein diversity necessary for development and function of complex organisms. 
              TDP43 regulates exon inclusion of the CFTR gene presumably through inteaction
              with nuclear proteins and specific sequences of nucleic acid.  This research
              investigates the molecular determinants and importance of TDP43 protein complex
              formation and nucleic acid binding.
