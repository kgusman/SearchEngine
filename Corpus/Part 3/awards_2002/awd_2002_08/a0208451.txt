Abstract    :
              For computers and robots to live up to their full potential as human assistants,
              they must be able to reliably perceive humans and objects in their environment.
              This project addresses the recognition of objects in complex everyday scenes
              (e.g.\ office, household, or traffic scenes). Biological vision systems have
              successfully solved the vision problem and the philosophy of this project is to
              try to extract principles from the information processing in the primate visual
              system and to apply them in the design of object recognition algorithms. The
              goal is to understand how object recognition in complex environments can be
              achieved in a hierarchical architecture that mimics the layout of the object
              recognition pathway in the  primate brain, and to build a demonstration system
              capable of recognizing a large number of objects in complex everyday scenes. In
              particular, this project will focus on three processing principles:
              hierarchical representations, massive feedback, and active scene analysis. If
              successful, the project will further our understanding of how objects can be
              recognized using hierarchical view based object representations, how these
              representations can be learned from unsegmented training images, and how
              feedback can aid recognition in this kind of hierarchical recognition
              architecture. This will potentially open a range of new application areas for
              computer vision systems and may also lead to a better understanding of object
              recognition in the brain.
