Adsorption of inorganic carbon on mineral phases has been
              of interest to researchers in many different fields of study, but little is
              known about the role that adsorption on rock-forming minerals may play in
              global CO2 sink, or how it may affect 14C dating in groundwater.  Preliminary 
              results suggest that adsorption of CO2 could account for a small but
              significant percentage of the terrestrial CO2 sink, and exchange  between the
              aqueous and adsorbed phase could influence 14C dating in groundwater.  The
              preliminary data comes from experiments with tuff (felsic volcanic rock).  Core
              samples were isolated from the atmosphere at the time of drilling, and were
              later opened and heated under vacuum to extract inorganic dissolved carbon
              (DIC) from water in the rock pores.  Carbon recoveries in excess of available
              DIC suggest that a sizeable reservoir of adsorbed carbon exists in these
              rocks.

A pilot project is proposed to investigate CO2 adsorption and
              associated isotopic fractionation on five volcanic rock materials representing
              suites of felsic and mafic minerals under dry, wetted, and saturated
              conditions.  Samples will be characterized for surface area, porosymmetry and
              mineralogy before use.  For dry and wetted experiments, crushed rock will be
              preheated at  2000C to generating adsorption isotherms, and again at 6000C in
              order to quatify the effect of trace organic coatings that may be present. 
              Adsorption isotherms will be measured under drying conditions and in the
              presence of a mono-layer of adsorbed water.  Isotopic fractionation will be
              evaluated by collecting head space gases after equilibration and measuring the
              d 13C of initial and equilibrated CO2.  Isotopic exchange will be evaluated by
              reintroducing CO2 with a unique d13 C signature and measuring head space gases
              again after equilibration.  Adsorption in saturated systems will be measured by
              introducing CO2 into the head space of a saturated slurry and monitoring the
              head space CO2 concentration and the pH to calculate the mass partitioned into
              the aqueous and adsorbed phases.  Isotopic fractionation and exchange will be
              measured in the same fashion as for dry and wetted experiments.

Results from
              this work will be used as a first step in estimating the magnitude of CO2
              adsorption as a terrestrial sink of atmospheric CO2, and the extent to which
              adsoption and exchange may alter 14C activities in groundwater.  The results
              will also be used to formulate a more targeted study of adsorption sites and
              mechanisms.  Educational impacts of the study include student training at both
              the graduate and undergraduate level.
