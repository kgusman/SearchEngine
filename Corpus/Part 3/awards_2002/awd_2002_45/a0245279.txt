Control theory has numerous applications in various fields of science
              and engineering, and has stimulated the development of many new ideas and
              methods.  In the past thirty years, two important lines of research in the
              study of optimal control and nonlinear control problems have been the so-called
              "differential-geometric" and "variational" approaches.  During the last decade,
              these two approaches have been brought together in work by many researchers
              dealing with stabilization and optimal control.  This award supports travel for
              participants in a special cluster of sessions devoted to work on these
              techniques within the setting offered by the 41st Conference on Decision and
              Control (CDC) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). 
              The sessions will bring together American and foreign researchers working in
              this growing field. 

The lectures will deal with geometric methods,
              variational methods, and diverse applications in the areas of aerodynamics,
              biomedical systems, semi-definite optimization, multi-objective optimal
              control, semi-conductor design, and approximations.  The discussions will
              facilitate the exchange of ideas and collaborative research and will help
              identify research directions with significant potential applications in
              industry and other related fields.
