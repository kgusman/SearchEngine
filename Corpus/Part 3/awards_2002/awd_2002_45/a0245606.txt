Title: Arthur's Conjecture,
              Spectural Theory, and Analytic Number Theory in Higher
              Rank

Abstract.

	The proposal concerns two problems with applications
              to
automorphic forms.  The first problem is in representation theory:
it is a
              conjecture in local harmonic analysis that is
motivated by taking Arthur's
              conjectures together with results
of Burger, Li and Sarnak. This problem is of
              interest as a
question in representation theory; it also offers a
              testing
ground for Arthur's conjectures and affords the possibility
of a
              better understanding of the automorphic spectrum. The
second problem is to
              study analytic number theory in the context
of automorphic forms on groups of
              higher rank.  The dream goal of
this is a better understanding of higher
              moments of L-functions,
but there are a number of easier and concrete
              problems, such as
the development of large-sieve inequalities, whose solution
              would
also have immediate consequences for analytic number theory.

	The
              project concerns two questions in the field of
``automorphic forms.'' This is
              a relatively new field of mathematics,
guided by the Langlands program -- it
              seeks to establish
connections between certain (apparently)
              far-separated
areas of mathematics. These connections have allowed work
              in
automorphic forms to have a significant impact in other fields.
Many
              cryptographic algorithms -- necessary for secure communication
over the
              Internet --  are based on
very subtle properties of prime numbers, and
              underlying
many of these algorithms are difficult results from analytic
              number
theory and automorphic forms. Another application
of automorphic forms
              has been the construction of ``Ramanujan graphs''
-- these are graphs with
              remarkable connectivity, and have had
application to communication networks
              and to theoretical computer
science. The questions under consideration will
              deepen
our understanding of automorphic forms. In addition
to the type of
              application just discussed,
these questions lie at the intersection of
              different fields of
mathematics, and will encourage collaboration between
              experts
in these different fields.
