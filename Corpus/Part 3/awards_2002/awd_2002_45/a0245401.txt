>
      In
              this project, I shall consider problems in harmonic analysis 
arising in
              geometric analysis and geometric measure theory, and in   
the theory of
              elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations
and operators.   These
              questions are interesting because of their
applicability to real world
              phenomena (see below), but also because 
of the deep connections among them. 
              The main directions of the 
proposed research include the following:
 
1. To
              develop and apply ``T1/Tb" (i.e., Carleson measure) 
criteria for the
              solvability of boundary problems for 
divergence form elliptic equations and
              systems.
 
2. To treat various problems in the theory of uniformly
              
rectifiable sets, in the applications of this theory to 
elliptic and
              parabolic PDE, and in the theory of 
quasiconformal mappings.
 
3. To obtain
              sharp average decay estimates for Fourier transforms, and 
to apply these to
              concrete problems including lattice point problems and
the Falconer distance
              problem.
 
    As mentioned above, I propose to work on problems in the area
              
of harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with,
              
geometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic and parabolic
partial
              differential equations.  Roughly speaking, in 
harmonic analysis one
              investigates properties of
functions and ``operators" (i.e., mappings which
              transform one function
into another) by decomposing them into smaller,
              constituent pieces,
which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the
              pieces.  The
name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical
              sound
into its various frequency components, or ``harmonics".
geometric
              measure theory involves the study of the relationship between
geometric
              properties of sets, and their ``measures" (the latter are
generalizations of
              the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial
differential equations of
              elliptic and of parabolic type describe a 
wide variety of phenoma in the real
              world, including electrostatics, 
certain fluid flows and elastic
              deformations, and various diffusion
processes
such as the conduction of heat,
              the flow of ground water, certain
phenomena arising in the mathematical theory
              of population biology, and the 
pricing of options in financial markets.  In
              the last decade the interplay 
between these different subfields of
              mathematics has turned out to be a
fertile ground 
for investigation, with
              much exciting work remaining to be done.
