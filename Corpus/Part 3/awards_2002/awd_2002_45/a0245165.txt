ABSTRACT
The research component of this proposal focuses on
              designing a methodological framework that, ultimately, will lead to the
              estimation of origin-destination matrices for freight movements, using
              secondary data, gathered through Intelligent Transportation Systems. These
              methodologies will improve transportation modeling by adding another layer of
              realism to the modeling process; and they will improve the efficiency of
              traffic management by ensuring proper consideration of freight movements,
              significant contributors to urban congestion. Furthermore, enhanced
              consideration of freight transportation will benefit the transportation
              planning process as a whole, making it truly multimodal in its scope. Such
              approaches will bypass two major obstacles in freight planning: the significant
              cost associated with conducting surveys to obtain origin-destination patterns,
              and the reluctance of freight providers to provide information they consider
              commercially sensitive. 
The research plan has the following three objectives:
              1) to develop a framework for the synthesis of origin-destination matrices in
              real-time, based on information gathered through Intelligent Transportation
              Systems in transportation networks; 2) to create a platform for the display of
              estimated freight movements; and, 3) to develop methodologies for the
              integration of real-time information on freight movement into the evaluation
              process and the analysis of traffic control strategies. The proposal considers
              the use of the Integrative Freight Market Simulation (IFMS).  The IFMS attempts
              to depict a comprehensive picture of freight movements, in which both the user
              side, i.e., commodity flows, and the logistic side, i.e., vehicle-trips, are
              considered. The uniqueness of freight transportation requires the use market
              equilibrium concepts to depict the competition process among freight
              transportation providers, and a subset of routing problems to represent the
              actions of these companies when picking up and delivering the goods. 
The IFMS
              entails a bi-level approach in which the top level corresponds to the
              estimation of the provision of service consistent with a Cournot-Nash
              equilibrium, while the bottom level focuses on the construction of tours that
              satisfy the Cournot-Nash solution and the remaining system constraints, in a
              context of a large scale optimization problem. Although a multitude of issues
              need to be solved before this concept becomes operational, the IFMS has the
              potential to enhance freight modeling.
An integrated educational plan is
              included as part of this proposal. The educational plan is intended to achieve
              the following objectives: a) to provide students with leadership experience in
              addressing complex problems, such as those in freight transportation; b) to
              create an atmosphere of cooperation among stakeholders; c) to provide both
              undergraduate and graduate students with the tools they need to analyze freight
              transportation problems; b) to provide the students with a thorough
              understanding of the interplay between transportation and the environment, and
              the role of transportation in the betterment of local communities; c) to
              provide the students with the foundations for a life long search for
              excellence; d) to provide the students with the opportunity to tackle real-life
              problems and to contribute to their solution; e) to provide meaningful and
              stimulating career choices for minority students and women. Achieving these
              objectives will: a) lead to the creation of a new generation of transportation
              professionals with a wholistic view of the interactions between freight
              transportation, the environment and economic development; b) lead to a
              transportation planning process sensitive to, and responsive to, community
              concerns, and economic development issues; c) enhance the quality of research
              and education by incorporating real-life problems and challenges into the class
              room interactions; d) promote retention among minority students and women; e)
              introduce students to the potential benefits of using modern information
              technology in multi-disciplinary settings.
