Award:  DMS-0245167
Principal Investigator:  Peter A. Cholak

The
              principal investigator plans to study the relationship
between definability
              and automorphisms in various structures
arising in computability theory. 
              Primarily, but not totally, he
will focus on the collection of all computably
              enumerable sets.
The principal investigator will also consider the collection
              of
all Pi01 classes and the computably enumerable degrees.  A long
range goal
              is to provide a complete understanding of these
structures and their
              automorphisms and definable orbits.  Some
related projects in computable
              structure theory and models of
second order arithmetic are also
              planned.

The main focus of these projects is on definability
              and
computability.  These notions are both important in measuring
              the
complexity of an answer to a mathematical problem.  Problems such
as "Is
              there a computer program which can solve all questions of
this type?"  One
              develops an intertwined hierarchy of
definability and computability.  Only
              answers which lay on the
lowest level are computable and even then they are
              not always
feasibly computable given today's computers.  Answers of
              higher
complexity provide useful mathematical information, allow one to
test
              the limits of mathematical techniques, reveal whether the
wrong techniques are
              being used, and, in some very rare cases,
can be useful for encoding/decoding
              information.
