Floer homology in symplectic geometry
was
              introduced by Floer in an attempt
to prove the Arnold conjecture. 
Various
              results by Chekanov, Oh, Polterovich
and Seidel have proved that the Floer
              homology is a general 
powerful tool to investigate symplectic topology.
In
              this project, Oh proposes to 
further investigate structure and applications
              of the Floer 
theory for deeper understanding of the Hamiltonian
              diffeomorphism group 
and Lagrangian submanifolds or more generally symplectic
              topology.
The Floer theory of Lagrangian submanifolds, via 
Fukaya's
              A-infinity category, also provides a geometric framework
for Kontsevich's
              homological mirror symmetry
proposal on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Oh's recent work
              with Fukaya, 
Ohta and Ono provides several key steps towards a rigorous
              
construction of Fukaya's category by developing an obstruction 
theory for
              defining the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology.
Complete construction
              will involve study of singular Lagrangian 
submanifolds, Lagrangian surgery
              and their relations to the Floer homology.
Oh proposes to investigate these
              new aspects of the Floer theory
in relation the mirror symmetry on the
              Calabi-Yau manifolds.

The Hamiltonian formalism plays
important roles not
              only for solving problems in classical mechanics
but also for quantizing the
              classical mechanics into
quantum mechanics.  The Poisson
bracket is the
              crucial geometric structure that plays a key role in
the classical mechanics
              and the quantum mechanics through the
quantization process. When one considers
              mechanics in 
a constrained system, i.e., mechanics on a curved space,
              
description of the corresponding phase space
and the geometric structure
              corresponding to the Poisson bracket
requires the notion of the symplectic
              structure
and symplectic manifolds. Symplectic geometry and topology 
is the
              study of symplectic manifolds. 
In symplectic geometry, there are two most
              important objects of
study. One is the study of Hamiltonian systems, a special
              type
of differential equation, and their periodic orbits.
This is dynamical
              in nature. The other is the study of geometry
and topology of Lagrangian
              submanifolds. This is geometric in nature.
Understanding the intersection
              theory of Lagrangian submanifolds
is the core of symplectic topology. Floer
              homology introduced 
by Floer in the end of 80's is a general machinery to
              study
this intersection theory. The Floer theory also provides a 
geometric
              framework for the  mirror symmetry phenomenon that 
was discovered by
              physicists in string theory.
Oh's proposed research aims at, on the one hand,
              deeper understanding of
symplectic topology, and also aims at understanding
              inter-relations 
between the symplectic and the complex geometry 
via the
              study of mirror symmetry.
