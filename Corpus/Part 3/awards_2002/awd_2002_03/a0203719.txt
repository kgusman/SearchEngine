Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Modeling the influence of climate change on fire regimes and successional
              patterns in topographically diverse landscapes in the Rocky Mountains." 
              Understanding the response of fire regimes to variation in regional climate and
              local topography is critical to predicting potential effects of global warming
              in forested ecosystems.  This research combines dendrochronology and GIS
              techniques to model potential responses of fire regimes and successional
              patterns to plausible climate change scenarios within two national parks in the
              Rocky Mountains.
