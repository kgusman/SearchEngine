This project investigates applications of
              integrality results for
morphisms under Topological Quantum Field Theories
              (TQFTs)  for
low-dimensional topology.  Strong Shift Equivalence (SSE) is
              an
equivalence relation which arose in symbolic dynamics.  Gilmer
              is
investigating a connection between TQFT and SSE which he has
              recently
discovered.  Using a TQFT one defines various SSE class invariants
              of
knots and other spaces which are equipped with an infinite cyclic
              cover.
This can now be derived as a consequence of a SSE class
              invariant.
Gilmer is attempting to use TQFT to find obstructions to classical
              knots
being slice knots.  In general, Gilmer is using TQFT as a tool
              in
low-dimensional topology. In joint work with Stepan Orevkov, Gilmer
              is
calculating further signatures and nullities of certain links which
              he
associated to collections of curves in the real projective plane. 
              In
previous work, Gilmer found restrictions on these invariants if
              the
collection of curves is isotopic to a real algebraic curve of
              given
degree.  These calculations may lead to new general restrictions on
              the
topology of real algebraic curves. Gilmer is also exploring
              relations
between real algebraic curves and shadow descriptions of links, in
              the
sense of Turaev.


Topology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is
              sometimes called "rubber
sheet geometry" because the objects under
              investigation can be twisted and
stretched (but not torn) without losing their
              identity. It is a subject
which impinges on many areas of mathematics and
              science.  Topological
Quantum Field Theory is one of the most current and
              exciting areas of
topology with intimate connections to high energy physics as
              well as other
areas of mathematics, for instance number theory and symbolic
              dynamical
systems. Gilmer is applying this subject to answer questions about
              knots,
links and 3-dimensional manifolds.  A 3-dimensional manifold is
              a
topological object which looks locally like the familiar space we live
              in.
One may also consider manifolds of other dimensions. It is ironic
              that
manifolds of dimension three and four are least well understood. One
              would
guess that our intuition should be strongest in these dimensions. A
              knot
is a closed loop in a 3-manifold. A link is a collection of closed
              loops
in a 3-manifold.  In 1900, Hilbert gave a famous list of problems
              for
mathematicians to study. His sixteenth problem concerns the topology
              of
real algebraic curves in the real projective plane, It is still
              unsolved
but it has lead to many beautiful developments and partial
              solutions.
Hilbert asked how the components (called ovals) of the set of zeros
              of a
nonsingular real homogenous polynomial of given degree can be arranged
              in
the plane, if the number of these ovals is maximal for the given
              degree.
This project further studies certain type of links to make progress
              on
Hilbert's problem and related questions.
