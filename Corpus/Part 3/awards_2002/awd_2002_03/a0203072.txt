ABSTRACT

This project has
              two components. One concerns complex analysis
on infinite dimensional
              manifolds, and the proposed problems  
are mostly cohomological in nature.
              They center around the
computation of Dolbeault and sheaf cohomology groups.
              Two types
of manifolds will be investigated: loop spaces of
              finite
dimensional compact complex manifolds and Stein manifolds. One
(longer
              term) goal will be to prove a Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch
type index theorem on
              loop spaces, another to discover an
appropriate class of sheaves for which
              cohomology can be proved
to vanish on infinite dimensional Stein manifolds
              (generalization
of the notion of coherent sheaves). I will also work on
              solving
the inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations in pseudoconvex
domains
              in Hilbert spaces. The finite dimensional component is
about extending the
              concept of holomorphic motion from the 
complex plane to motions of higher
              dimensional complex manifolds
and their subsets. This will hopefully provide a
              useful tool for
higher dimensional complex dynamics.

Mathematics in general
              elucidates the formal structures
that underlie the exploration of our world.
              An example of
such a structure is a function, which formalizes the notion
of
              "dependence" among variable quantities. For instance
temperature at some
              location on Earth depends on the
latitude and the longitude of the location,
              but also on
the altitude, and the time of the measurement: we have a
              function
of four variables. In another context, the temperature of say
a mole
              of a gas depends on the velocity of each molecule of the
gas, thus on
              trillions and trillions of variables. Functions
of such a huge number of
              variables are best understood by
idealizing to infinitely many variables.
              These are the main
objects of the proposed research: functions of
              infinitely
many variables. The variables are complex rather than
              real
numbers. Introducing complex variables typically streamlines
problems,
              and having solved the complexified problem one can
often go back and obtain,
              by restriction, a solution to the
original real problem. The problems to be
              considered are partly
motivated by various mathematical disciplines, and also
              by
theoretical physics.
