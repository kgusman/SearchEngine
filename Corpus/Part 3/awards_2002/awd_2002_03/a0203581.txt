Abstract    :
              Discrete models of the Euler equations governing fluid mechanics will be
              analyzed with the goal of understanding high Reynolds number turbulent flows.
              The comprehensive approach will involve a combination of mathematical analysis
              of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, physical modeling based on discrete particle
              representations of the Euler equations, and high performance computing. The
              mathematical problem is of N-body type, thus numerical algorithm development
              for these systems and dynamical systems visualization techniques will be an
              essential component of the work carried out under this award. The four main
              projects described in the proposal are each designed to develop new analytical
              techniques in dynamical systems theory, test current techniques on models that
              are physically well grounded, develop new numerical algorithms and
              visualization methods for particle interaction problems, and push the models
              closer towards applications.

This project involves the development of
              discrete models for fluid flow, using a combination of mathematical tools and
              high performance computing. One major emphasis will be on studying these models
              on the surface of a sphere, both rotating and non-rotating, a problem which has
              direct applications to the flow in a planetary atmosphere on such large scales
              that the curvature of the planet plays a role in the dynamics. This problem is
              potentially of great importance to the understanding of environmental processes
              in the atmospheres and oceans of Earth and to the large vortices, including the
              Red Spot, observed in the atmosphere of Jupiter.
