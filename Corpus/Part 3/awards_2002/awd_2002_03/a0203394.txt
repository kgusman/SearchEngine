The PI of this proposal intends to study the
              topology of 3-dimensional
manifolds via Dehn surgery, essential surfaces and
              essential
laminations.  It is a common method to use 2-dimensional surfaces as
              a
tool in studying 3-manifolds.  The most useful surfaces in
              studying
3-manifolds are essential surface, essential laminations, and
              Heegaard
surfaces.  The purpose of this project is to study the properties
              of
3-manifolds using these surfaces and Dehn surgery.  There have been
great
              progress in this area in the last few years, for example we now
know that an
              essential surface will remain essential after most Dehn
surgeries, and the
              exact upper bounds on distances between all ten
pairs of nonsimple surgery
              types have been determined.  However there
are still some very important
              problems remaining to be solved in this
area.  An objective of this project is
              to determine how many surgeries
are ``exceptional'' in certain sense, for
              example, how many will
produce so called Seifert manifolds, and how many will
              kill an
essential surface.  The PI will also study the problem of how
              an
immersed surface intersects a Heegaard surface.

3-manifolds are objects
              that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional
spaces, but whose global
              structure may be quite complicated.  Such
objects appear naturally from
              different areas of mathematics as well
as physics and other sciences.  The
              ultimate goal in the study of
3-manifold topology is to have a thorough
              understanding of the
structure of 3-manifolds.  This has not been achieved
              yet, but there
has been a great progress towards the proof of a conjectural
              picture
described by Thurston more than 20 years ago.  The PI proposes
              to
continue studying 3-manifolds via Dehn surgery, which is a method
              of
constructing new 3-dimensional spaces from an existing
              3-dimensional
space, by removing a neighborhood of a circle and then gluing
              back in
a different way.  The achievement of this project will be an
              important
step towards the goal of having a clear understanding of
              the
topological and geometric structures of 3-manifolds.
