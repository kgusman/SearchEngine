Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Applying biological informatics and chemical genetics to explore developmental
              processes regulated by the plant hormone auxin."  The plant hormone auxin
              arbitrates plant development at multiple levels.  This research deconvolutes
              the complex regulatory network controlled by auxin and its effectors using
              small molecules, oligonucleotide microarrays, and bioinformatics. More broadly,
              it develops a general experimental and analytical framework for using chemical
              genetics and biological informatics to elucidate intricate signaling pathways
              in plants.
