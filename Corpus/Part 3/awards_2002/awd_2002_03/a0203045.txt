The project encompasses different aspects of
              geometry, 
topology, and geometric group theory. The unifying theme 
is the
              geometric and topological study of spaces with large 
symmetry groups.
              Sometimes it is the group that arises first, 
for example as a symmetry group
              of an algebraic object, and 
then a space is constructed with symmetries
              reflecting this 
group. This allows for geometric/topological methods to
be
              used in algebra. Another aspect of the project involves 
finding hyperbolic
              structures on 3-dimensional manifolds. 
The possibility that all (compact)
              spaces that locally look 
like our ordinary 3-dimensional space are in fact
              geometric 
objects was first conceived by W.P. Thurston and verified 
in many
              cases. Yet another aspect involves Diophantine
geometry over groups. This is
              about a study of logical 
statements that hold for a particular class of
              groups. 
Surprisingly, as shown by the work of Z. Sela, topology 
enters this
              study; for example, surfaces appear naturally 
when one considers free
              groups.

More specifically, the topics of the project are: Singularities 
of
              character varieties and topological dynamics on character
varieties, Explicit
              bounds in the compactness theorems for 
spaces of discrete and faithful
              representations, Weak 
hyperbolization conjecture and immersed surface
              laminations 
in 3-manifolds, Constructions of Kaehler groups of low
              
cohomological dimension, Diophantine geometry over groups,
Finiteness
              properties of the Torelli group, Rigidity theorems 
for Coxeter, Artin, and
              related groups.
