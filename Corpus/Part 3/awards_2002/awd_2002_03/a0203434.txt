              ABSTRACT DMS - 0203434.

Frank Morgan will study minimal structures in
              singular universes: with
conical singularities or with Lipschitz metrics, for
              example. He will also
study mathematical models for soap bubbles clusters and
              immiscible fluids
"with multiplicities," following work of Fleming and White.
              Methods include
standard and innovative applications of geometric measure
              theory,
differentiable geometry, differential equations, and techniques from
              the
proof of the Double Bubble Conjecture. He will supervise
              related
undergraduate research, especially on variations on the double
              bubble
problem in various ambients and settings.

The guiding principle of
              nature seems to be energy minimization, from the
microstructure of materials
              to black holes in the universe. As one of the
simplest examples, soap bubble
              clusters seek to minimize surface area. If
successful, Morgan's study of such
              problems will enhance our understanding
of fundamental physical principles,
              with implications for the structure of
materials and the universe.
