Abstract    :
              This project is a laboratory study of a diverse set of atmospheric reactions
              potentially important to odd hydrogen (HOx) and organic analog (ROx) cycling in
              the troposphere and stratosphere.  Initially, laboratory experiments will
              involve direct detection of short-lived intermediates and weakly bound
              complexes by isolating and identifying spectroscopic signatures.  Reaction
              kinetics of these various reactive intermediates will then be studied using a
              variety of sensitive spectroscopic techniques and reactant flow systems
              designed to cover broad ranges of temperature and pressure representative of
              the ambient atmosphere (troposphere and stratosphere).  Laboratory results will
              be combined with theoretical calculations involving quantum mechanical and
              statistical-dynamical computations.  The broader impacts of this work include
              results that will be important in gaining a better understanding of the
              oxidative pathways controlling the oxidizing capacity of the Earth's
              atmosphere, and thereby improve greatly our understanding of some important
              reactions driving tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.  This project will
              also provide laboratory research training for three graduate students and one
              postdoctoral researcher.
