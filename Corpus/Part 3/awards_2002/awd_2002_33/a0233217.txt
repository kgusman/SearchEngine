Abstract    :
              Improved power management and distribution is essential for wireless power
              transmission (WPT) for next generation Space Solar Power (SSP) systems. A
              highly efficient C-band rectifying antenna (rectenna) array for WPT has been
              demonstrated to operate at 5.61 GHz at 78% efficiency at Texas A&M. The
              rectenna array combines high efficiency RF to DC diode conversion with a
              wideband, high gain and circularly polarized array to produce DC power
              regardless of array's orientation. In this project we propose to further extend
              this work by investigating suitable DC to DC and DC to AC Converters employing
              Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a nearly ideal material
              for power switching devices and diodes. The primary objective of this proposal
              is to investigate a variety of new converter topologies, which can be directly
              interfaced with rectifying antenna array. The project consists of two parts.
              The first part will focus on an experimental setup to demonstrate suitable
              converter topologies for rectenna type DC power source. An experimental 100V,
              200W, 500kHz, SiC power conversion powered by a rectenna will be studied for
              its performance followed by an in-depth evaluation. The second part of this
              project will perform a trade study to investigate rectenna power converter
              architectures for higher power, higher voltage WPT systems. A rectenna array
              interfaced to a power converter will be considered as a building block and
              several series / parallel combinations of the building blocks will be studied
              for increased voltage and current capability.
