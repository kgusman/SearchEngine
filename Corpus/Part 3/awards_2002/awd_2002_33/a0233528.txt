Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding to design a coordinated system of student assessment
              resources and technical assistance for addressing the assessment needs of the
              MSPs.   The design study has four goals:  1) To identify the student assessment
              needs of MSP programs and classrooms through a survey of assessments the MSPs
              plan to use, their current approaches to assessment, and their needs for
              additional forms of assessment and technical assistance;  2) To design an
              assessment resource management system (ARMS) that takes advantage of the
              affordances of technology to serve the MSPs nationwide by supporting access,
              use, customization and development of a range of appropriate assessments for
              MSP programs and classrooms; 3) To plan the development of new assessment forms
              in mathematics and science, some of which may be technologically-supported; and
              4) To design a longitudinal study of the impact of MSPs on assessment practice
              at the classroom, school, district and state level.
