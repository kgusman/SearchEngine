The
              mathematics of turbulence, the "last unsolved problem of classical physics,"
              has traditionally been statistical in nature.  This approach leads to long-term
              predictions of the bulk properties of generic fluid flows.  In contrast, many
              technological and geophysical mixing problems, such as mixing of fuel and air
              in a combustor, or the spread of an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, call for
              detailed finite-time predictions on turbulent mixing.

This project is
              concerned with further development and novel applications of the recent theory
              of finite-time mixing.  This new nonlinear theory enables one to analyze
              concrete numerical or experimental velocity fields and isolate global
              structures in the flow that is responsible for mixing or lack thereof.  The
              project will involve applications of these new techniques and their extensions
              to global circulation models, vortex breakdown and merger, ocean drifter data
              analysis, mixing enhancement in combustors, and continuous steel casting.
