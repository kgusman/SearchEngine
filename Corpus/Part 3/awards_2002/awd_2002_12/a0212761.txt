Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Jill Bargonetti at Hunter College (part of the City
              University of New York) to carry out the project "Growth Control Regulated by
              p53 and MDM2". The Bargonetti laboratory has evidence that a dysfunctional
              p53-MDM2 feedback loop may exist in some cells and when this occurs p53 is not
              targeted for degradation despite the formation of a nuclear p53-MDM2 complex.
              In cells with such a dysfunctional p53-MDM2 complex, p53 does not activate some
              target genes (for example p21) that promote growth arrest, but does activate
              other gene targets (like mdm2) that aid in cell survival. The aims of this
              grant are to identify if a specific p53 protein complex that correlates with
              dysfunctional wild-type p53 is, in fact, a p53-MDM2 complex; and if this
              protein complex causes p53 to constitutively interact with the mdm2 gene in
              nuclear chromatin. Aim one is to identify the amino acid sequences of the MDM2
              immuno-reactive proteins that specifically co-immunoprecipitate with
              dysfunctional wild-type p53 and functional p53 from human cell lines. The
              Bargonetti laboratory has found a potentially novel form of MDM2 associated
              with dysfunctional wild-type p53. Aim two is to determine if a p53:MDM2 protein
              complex can interact with the mdm2 p53-binding site in nuclear chromatin.
              Chromatin immuno-precipitation-PCR (CHIP-PCR), utilizing both p53 specific and
              MDM2 specific monoclonal antibodies, is used to investigate the nuclear "in
              vivo" interaction of p53 and MDM2 with the mdm2 promoter regions (P1 and P2).
              Aim three is to determine the mRNA sequences and phosphorylation states of p53
              and MDM2 in cell lines that have a functional feedback loop versus those that
              are dysfunctional as described above. The RT-PCR mdm2 products from a cell line
              with dysfunctional wild-type p53 as well as products from a cell line with
              properly functioning p53 are being sequenced. Nested PCR is being used to
              compare the spliced mdm2 transcripts in the cell line with dysfunctional
              wild-type p53 to normally functioning p53 to see if there is a difference.
              Phospho-specific antibodies are used to investigate the phosphorylation state
              of p53. 

Hunter College is an undergraduate minority institution.
              Undergraduates are recruited into and mentored in the laboratory and graduate
              students from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York are active
              members of the Bargonetti research team. The studies being carried out concern
              the regulation of p53, a cellular protein that acts as a central controller
              receiving signals from many different routes and controlling numerous
              downstream pathways. Signal transduction pathways must utilize p53 as a major
              connection point in much the same way as travelers from many different
              destinations cross paths at major stations before embarking to different
              destinations. The p53-MDM2 feedback loop, whereby p53 turns on mdm2 and the
              MDM2 protein inactivates p53, is a key signaling pathway to p53. The studies
              being carried out are to examine a dysfunction p53-MDM2 feedback loop. The two
              proteins interact but the signal after interaction does not inhibit cell
              growth. The mechanism for this dysfunctional loop is being examined. Scientific
              excellence is stressed in the Bargonetti laboratory and the students are
              instructed in professional presentation of their data, scientific
              collaboration, collegiality and ethics. This project has the potential to
              identify a novel form of regulation of p53 by MDM2, while producing a new
              generation of scientists.
