Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed Project ACCESS is to increase the number of associate's
              and Bachelor's degrees in Engineering granted to residents of South Central
              Texas.

The following activities will be implemented in order to achieve the
              project's goal and outcomes: 1)  Establishing dual credit engineering courses
              in at least five area high schools; 2) Training faculty at community college in
              distance education and/or infusion of state-of-the-art technology into
              engineering curricula; 3) Supplementing community college curriculum with
              state-of-the-art engineering education materials and software; 4) Converting at
              least 75% of San Antonio College Engineering Courses and Engineering Math will
              be converted into Internet format; 5) developing a new engineering course,
              "Engineering Mathematics," for San Antonio College Engineering and Dual Credit
              students; 6) SAC will obtain new articulation agreements for 2 + 2 transfers
              with at least two additional 4-year Engineering programs in the South and
              Central Texas area; and 7) other Alamo Community College District and area
              engineering faculty will be made aware of the availability of new curricula.
              

San Antonio College will work closely with the University of Texas at San
              Antonio, Texas A & M, South West Texas University and other schools to
              articulate seamless engineering courses of study for "2 + 2 + 2" (high
              school/community college/university) students.

The expected outcomes of this
              project are the following: 1) at least 40 high school students, half minority,
              will be enrolled in dual credit Engineering or pre-Engineering courses with San
              Antonio College each year; 2) at least 30 students each semester will be
              enrolled in one or more Web-based Engineering course; 3) the number of minority
              Engineering majors at San Antonio College who transfer to Engineering programs
              at four-year institutions  will be increased by at least 200%; and 4) the
              numbers of minority students graduating from San Antonio College with an
              Associate's Degree in Engineering will be increased by at least 200%.
