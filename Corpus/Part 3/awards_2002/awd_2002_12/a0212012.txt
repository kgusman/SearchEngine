Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project proposes to
              functionalize TNT-metallofullerenes with highly water-soluble,
              steric-stabilizing ligands and to evaluate these materials as general
              MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) contrast agents. Classical endohedral
              metallofullerenes are produced in exceedingly low yields and are unstable in
              air. In contrast,  the development of trimetallic-nitride-template (TNT)
              process by the investigators has allowed the production of  a new class of
              extremely stable endohedral metallofullerenes  in sufficient research
              quantities. Biomedical applications in diagnostic and therapeutic areas offer a
              near-term opportunity to utilize these materials because the quantities
              required for such applications are relatively small, and these nanomaterials
              offer unique advantages over current systems. The TNT process allows the
              encapsulation of 1-3 paramagnetic lanthanides, isolating the metals from the
              body. Preliminary data indicates that hydroxylated, gadolinium-containing
              TNT-metallofullerenes increase the proton relaxation rate of surrounding water
              molecules significantly over currently used gadolinium chelates. However,
              aggregation of typical hydroxylated fullerenes prevents their maximum
              efficiency and utility. Addition of large, highly soluble ligands is expected
              to promote enhanced water solubility, deter aggregation, and deliver an even
              larger enhancement over current gadolinium MRI contrast agents.

The
              commercial applications of this project are in the area of Biomedical
              Imaging.
