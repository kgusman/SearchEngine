Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Hales will conduct theoretical and experimental research on
              the properties of boron-halide clusters.  Candidate species include B2F5(+), 
              B2Br5(+),  B2Br3(+)  and others.  The structures of these complexes are
              predicted to be similar to those of BnHn(2-) and BnXn, where X = Cl, Br, or I. 
              The goal of this research is to verify these predictions. This research will be
              conducted with the assistance of undergraduate students.

Ion-molecule
              chemistry is one of the core areas of contemporary chemical research.  This
              project deals with the structure of clusters of boron halides and other species
              related to plasma processing of semiconductors.  Computational modeling of the
              observed ions complements the experimental work.  These cast light on the
              structures of the cluster ions and on ion-molecule processes that lead to those
              structures.  This research is conducted with the assistance of undergraduate
              students.  They will receive training in one of the contemporary forefront
              areas of physical chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or entry into
              the scientific/technological workforce.
