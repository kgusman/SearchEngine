Using a class of triggered-seismicity models, we have
              recently 
(i)	classified the different regimes of triggered seismicity,
              
(ii)	found that the numerous small and intermediate-sized earthquakes may
              have a significantly larger effect than large earthquakes on future seismicity,
              when taken together, 
(iii)	showed how cascades of triggered seismicity may
              lead to aftershock diffusion and foreshock migration, 
(iv)	discovered that
              the inverse Omori law may derive from the direct Omori law as the most probable
              trajectory of seismicity leading to a mainshock, and 
(v)	explained a change
              of the Gutenberg-Richter law from a concave to a convex shape for
              foreshocks.

Building on these empirical results and on our theoretical
              understanding of models of triggered seismicity, we will: 
1)	investigate
              several  physical mechanisms underlying the local Omori's law to constrain the 
              origins of its observed variability and to understand better the  physics of
              triggered seismicity, 
2)	analyze in novel ways the data available from
              different catalogs, both regional (such as SCEC) and worldwide (such as ISC)
              which careful attention brought to their completeness and their quality;
              
3)	perform careful and systematic explorations of reported seismic patterns
              and analyze them in the perspective offered by the parsimonious
              triggered-seismicity model; 
4)	develop a new statistical method for inversion
              of the triggering seismicity model taking into account the incompleteness of
              the catalogs for small earthquakes; 
5)	test the validity and limits of
              stress-transfer models that neglect cascades of triggered seismicity;
              and
6)	develop a forecasting methodology using the triggered seismicity model
              with its cascade of triggered events as a strong null-hypothesis to test
              against other hypotheses and to develop accurate seismic hazard assessment in
              southern California.
