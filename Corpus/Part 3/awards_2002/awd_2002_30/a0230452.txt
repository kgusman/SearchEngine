Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of the chemical composition of air in the snow layer
              (firn) in a region of "megadunes" near Vostok station, Antarctica.  It will
              test the hypothesis that a deep "convective zone" of vigorous wind-driven
              mixing can prevent gas fractionation in the upper one-third of the polar firn
              layer. In the megadunes, ultralow snow accumulation rates lead to structural
              changes (large grains, pipes, and cracks) that make the permeability of firn to
              air movement orders of magnitude higher than normal. The unknown thickness of
              the convective zone has hampered the interpretation of ice core 15N/14N and
              40Ar/36Ar ratios as indicators of past firn thickness, which is a key
              constraint on the climatically important variables of temperature, accumulation
              rate, and gas age-ice age difference.  Studying this "extreme end-member"
              example will better define the role of the convective zone in gas
              reconstructions.  This study will pump air from a profile of ~20 depths in the
              firn, to definitively test for the presence of a convective zone based on the
              fit of observed 15 N/14N and 40Ar/36Ar to a molecular- and eddy-diffusion
              model. Permeability measurements on the core and 2-D air flow modeling (in
              collaboration with M. Albert) will permit a more physically realistic
              interpretation of the isotope data and will relate mixing vigor to air
              velocities. A new proxy indicator of convective zone thickness will be tested
              on firn and ice core bubble air, based on the principle that isotopes of
              slow-diffusing heavy noble gases (Kr, Xe) should be more affected by convection
              than isotopes of fast-diffusing N2 . These tools will be applied to a test of
              the hypothesis that the megadunes and a deep convective zone existed at the
              Vostok site during glacial periods, which would explain the anomalously low
              15N/14N and 40Ar/36Ar in the Vostok ice core glacial periods. The broader
              impacts of this work include 1) clarification of phase relationships of
              greenhouse gases and temperature in ice core records, with implications for
              understanding of past and future climates, 2) education of one graduate
              student, and 3) building of collaborative relationships with five
              investigators.
