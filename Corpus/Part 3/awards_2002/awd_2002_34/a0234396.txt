Abstract    :
              Three-dimensional (3-D) modeling studies will be carried out aimed at an
              improved understanding of the global budgets of several important atmospheric
              trace gases. Specifically, the project will focus on oxygenated organics
              (methanol, acetaldehyde, propanal, and acetone), methyl halides (methyl
              chloride and bromide), and carbon-containing gases from combustion (hydrogen
              cyanide, acetylene, ethane, and carbon monoxide). A combination of forward and
              inverse modeling will be used. Forward model simulations based on best a priori
              estimates of sources and sinks will be compared to both observed concentrations
              and species-species correlations. Airborne data from various field programs
              will be used for this purpose. Inverse analysis will be used when appropriate
              to better quantify the magnitudes of individual source terms and corresponding
              errors. The work on trace carbon gases will be carried out in collaboration
              with Jennifer Logan (Harvard University), and will use data from a worldwide
              network of IR absorption measurements and ship cruises. 

Improved knowledge
              of the atmospheric budgets of the above gases will have important and general
              implications for the understanding of global atmospheric chemistry and broader
              problems of biogeochemical cycling. This award will provide educational
              opportunities for graduate students and a post-doctoral student.
