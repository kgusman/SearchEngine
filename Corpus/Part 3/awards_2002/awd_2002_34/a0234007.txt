Gene therapy is an exciting new modality for treating and
              preventing vascular disease. Engineered gene therapy delivery techniques could
              make this technology more affordable and thus broadly accessible to the
              cardiovascular patient population. By applying quantitative engineering
              analyses to a living, biological system, the PI hopes to further our knowledge
              of human vascular transport mechanisms (aim 1), optimize adenoviral gene
              therapy methods (aim 2), and assess the efficacy of optimized gene therapy
              treatment strategies in human arteries and veins (aim 3). An ex vivo vascular
              culture system will be used to pursue each of these goals. Ex vivo arterial and
              venous organ culture is an ideal experimental paradigm for investigating
              vascular transport phenomena under rigorous environmental and mechanical
              control.  Further, it allows living human tissue experimentation in a
              three-dimensional, near-physiological environment. 

The first educational
              goal of the proposed career plan is to teach engineering students the
              fundamentals in the PI's area of specialization: the thermofluid sciences (aim
              1). The techniques of problem-based learning and interaction with local
              industry will be used to achieve this goal. The second aim is to strengthen
              teamwork and communication skills in both graduate and undergraduate engineers
              (aim 2).  Specifically, students will be given design projects in classes and
              assigned to mixed-level and mixed-gender teams. They will be given instruction
              in technical communication and practice by giving presentations to their peers
              and a lay audience (local middle-school children). The third goal of the
              educational program is to addresses the problem of diversity in the engineering
              workforce (aim 3). University-level mentoring will be frequent and informal. 
              Through outreach and mentoring at the university, high school and middle school
              levels, the PI hopes to increase the number of women in engineering and in the
              pipeline.
