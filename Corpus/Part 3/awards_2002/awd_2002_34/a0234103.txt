"Failure of the
              Teton Dam: A New Theory"

The objective of this research is to verify a new
              theory regarding the failure of the Teton Dam. The Teton Dam, in Idaho, failed
              during its first filling on 5 June 1976. It resulted in 14 fatalities and a
              very large economic loss.  Its failure was one of the most publicized events
              involving a large earth fill dam in recent times. The dam was designed and
              built using modern standards; therefore its failure received considerable
              attention from engineering experts.  However the failure assessment and
              prognosis by experts, including the Independent Panel (IP) and the Interior
              Review Group (IRG), failed to arrive at a consensus.  Failure mechanisms
              suggested, included hydraulic fracture, internal erosion, the wet-seam theory,
              and defects in the abutment rock.  None of the investigations, however, was
              able to explain satisfactorily why the dam breached when the reservoir reached
              El. 5301.7 ft and only in the vicinity of Sta. 15+00 on the right abutment.
              

This investigation is based on a preliminary work using fundamental "state
              based soil mechanics". It indicates that a deep open transverse vertical
              crack(s) existed in the core (Zone-1) to EL.5300 ft and the deepest crack(s)
              occurred only in the right abutment and in the vicinity of Sta. 14+00 to
              Sta.15+00.  When the reservoir rose above El. 5300 ft in the early hours of 5
              June 1976, water flowed through the open transverse vertical crack(s) into the
              pervious downstream Zone-2, which was seated on bedrock at El. 5200 ft.  The
              water flow slowly eroded the crack into a large tunnel leading to the major
              breach of the dam hours later.  This preliminary work is based on the critical
              state soil mechanics framework.  It assumes that the mechanical behavior of
              soils, such as the compressibility, pore pressure response, shear behavior with
              respect to yield, rupture and fracture, is dependent on the "state of soil" in
              q-p-e (shear stress-mean stress-void ratio) space or equivalently the LI - p
              (Liquidity Index - mean stress) space. 

A one-day workshop will be held at
              the conclusion of the program, at which a panel of experts will meet with the
              investigators to examine the research results and provide a critique in light
              of past investigations of the Teton failure.  The expert committee will include
              professionals from the US Bureau of Reclamation, the US Army Corps of
              Engineers, and academics.  The proceedings of the workshop, along with a
              detailed analysis of the Teton Dam failure and recommendations, will be
              disseminated via the worldwide web.
