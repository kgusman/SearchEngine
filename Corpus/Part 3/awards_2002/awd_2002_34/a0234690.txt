Interfaces and Model Checking for Software
PI: Luca de
              Alfaro

When software is used in critical applications, errors that go
              undetected in the design phase and occur during actual system operation can
              have disastrous consequences.  The proposed research focuses on the development
              of techniques for software verification based on the joint use
              of
model-checking and interface theories.

Software model-checking
              constructs and analyzes finite abstractions of the software, refining the
              abstractions until they can be shown to satisfy a property, or until errors are
              found in the software.
Interface theories permit the specification of the
              interaction behavior of software components.
The proposed research will
              combine these two techniques into a scalable and compositional approach to
              software verification, where model-checking is used to analyze individual
              software components, and interfaces are used to specify and verify the
              interaction between the
components in a design.  
The approach will be
              applied to the verification of the NASA MDS testbed.

The intellectual merit
              of the proposed project consists in the
development of a compositional
              approach to software verification based
on the joint use of  methods for
              single-component and
multiple-component analysis.
The broader impact consists
              in the development of tools and approaches
for the design-time validation of
              software, thereby increasing both
dependability and quality of software
              systems.
