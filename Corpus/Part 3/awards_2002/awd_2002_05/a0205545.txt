              ABSTRACT DMS - 0205545.

A number of problems of elliptic and parabolic type
              in
general relativity will be studied.  The investigator
will model rotating
              stars by a self-gravitating 
perfect fluid rigidly rotating on its own axis
              using a
perturbation method. The perturbation parameter is the
ratio of the
              angular velocity to the central density,
allowing rapidly rotating solutions
              when the density
is sufficiently high. The investigator will work on
the
              uniqueness of the Kerr black holes, to rule out
multiple black hole
              configurations, as conjectured by
Roger Penrose.  A new approach is proposed
              consisting
of the investigation of the relation between
uniqueness theorems
              for black holes in equilibrium and
Penrose-type inequalities. The investigator
              will
continue his work on the connectedness of the space of
initial data for
              the Einstein vacuum equations,
extending results obtained in the context
              of
quasi-convex foliations, foliations with leaves of
positive Gauss and mean
              curvature.  The investigator
will work, in collaboration with Y. Li and A.
              S.
Tahvildar-Zadeh, on blow-up of wave maps, the
dynamical counterparts of
              harmonic maps.  These maps
have attracted considerable attention by
              researchers
in nonlinear hyperbolic equations mainly due to their
similarity
              to the Einstein equations.  The
investigator will also work on the asymptotic
              behavior
of harmonic maps with prescribed singularities into
Hadamard
              manifolds.


Mathematical general relativity overlaps three
disciplines:
              physics, geometry, and nonlinear partial
differential equations. As such, it
              is an ideal source
of problems whose solutions have the potential
              to
influence all three of these fields.  The problems in
this project fall in
              this category.  For example, the
study of Penrose-type inequalities is of
              interest both
to mathematical relativists and to geometers studying
spaces of
              dimension three. Developing a good
mathematical model for dense rapidly
              rotating stars is
an important goal in astrophysics, for example when
trying
              to understand pulsars, and would also
contribute new results in perturbation
              theory.  
Understanding wave maps should help the study of other
nonlinear
              evolution equations governing various
physical phenomena.
