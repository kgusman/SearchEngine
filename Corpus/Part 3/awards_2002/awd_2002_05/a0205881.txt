To clarify the physical structure, gas and dust
              content, as well as the potential for planet
formation around the poorly
              understood inner circumstellar disk regions of Herbig AeBe young emission line
              stars, the PI has begun a high resolution infrared (3-5mm) study of various
              molecules such as CO and H 3+  that are expected to be present. The
              near-infrared is a challenging spectral region to work,  but this spectral
              region is optimal to explore CO as well as the symmetric hydrocarbons (e.g. CH
              4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 2 ) and H 3+ in material around hot young stars. For Herbig
              AeBe stars, it is not clear that primordial gas and dust can remain
              sufficiently long in the inner regions (1-50 AU) close to the star for planet
              formation to occur.  The PI has already presented results for several such
              stars showing the detection of CO, CH 4 , and H3+  (the first detection of H 3+
              emission outside the Solar System ever made). This research  will use
              fundamental CO lines (4.7mm) to measure temperatures, column densities, and
              mass of CO in the inner disks around these stars.  Observations of H 3+  may
              provide a more quantitative understanding of the chemical processing and the
              importance of energetic photo-processing in inner disks of these pre-main
              sequence stars. H 3+ is important as a direct probe of the ionization rate in
              preplanetary disks and is important in disk chemistry as nearly all ion-neutral
              reactions are initialized by this molecule.  The detection of CO, CH 4 , and H
              3+ are important to quantify the physical and chemical evolution of the inner
              disk and also constrain the gas dissipation rate and potential for planetary
              formation. Secondly, H 3+ is shown as a potential method to search for evidence
              of planet formation and/or disk evolution that will provide theorists an
              additional avenue to constrain disk and extra-solar planet formation.
