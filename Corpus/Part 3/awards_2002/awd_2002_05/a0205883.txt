Abstract    :
              The Educational Develpoment Center (EDC) and National Institute on Out-of-School
              Time (NIOST), in collaboration with science centers in AZ, MA, TX, NY, NC and
              CA, will develop and implement a science curriculum for informal audiences
              targeting children ages 8-12.  Each science center will work with six community
              centers that serve youth in after-school programs.  Science center staff will
              train after-school program leaders from the 36 community centers at monthly
              sessions, in addition to holding monthly events for families.  Curriculum
              development will use interesting topics aligned with national standards and
              structure investigations as games using simple materials.  The units will
              enable children to work in teams, and include follow-up, discussion and
              extended investigations using websites.  It is anticipated that each child will
              complete 4-6 related investigations.  While the six science centers will
              provide the content expertise, EDC and NIOST will develop the training and
              assessment program and provide additional technical support for the community
              centers.  The result will be a model to support out-of-school programs that
              combines science centers and community resource people, centered around an
              activity-based curriculum focused on inquiry. Up to 1,000 children will be
              involved in field tests each summer.  This proposal builds on "Design It!" 
              (ESI 98-14765), which created an informal science curriculum focused on
              engineering principles.
