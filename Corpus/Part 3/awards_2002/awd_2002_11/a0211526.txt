Changes to natural landscapes can have profound effects
              on population densities and spatial distributions of organisms, greatly
              modifying natural breeding patterns.  Two novel genetic analyses will examine
              spatial and temporal variation in the breeding patterns of natural and
              human-modified populations of the tropical dry-forest tree, Enterolobium
              cyclocarpum, located in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica.  The availability of
              seed collections dating from 1995 provides a unique temporal dimension to these
              analyses.  Studies of the pollination ecology of this species will supplement
              the genetic analyses allowing more informed interpretations of the genetic
              data.

This research has several broader impacts.  First, it will determine
              if human-induced habitat modifications significantly modify breeding patterns
              of tropical trees to such an extent that natural levels of genetic diversity
              can't be maintained.  Second, temporal analyses will demonstrate whether
              studies of a few reproductive events adequately describe breeding patterns of a
              long-lived tree. These comprehensive studies should also assist the development
              of effective landscape management plans that consider the spatial extent of
              natural breeding populations.  Finally, comparisons of the two genetic analyses
              should determine whether the less resource-demanding approach dependably
              estimates breeding parameters.  If so, this could provide a major breakthrough
              for landscape-level studies of pollen movement patterns in a wide variety of
              plant species.
