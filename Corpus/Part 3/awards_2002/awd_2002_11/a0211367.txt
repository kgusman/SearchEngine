     The investigators derive and analyze mathematical
              models
that describe how spatial aspects of the environment and the ways
that
              organisms utilize space and disperse through it influence
the dynamics of
              populations and the structure of ecological
communities.  The underlying
              motivation for the project is to gain
a better understanding of how spatial
              effects can threaten or
maintain biodiversity or affect interactions between
              important
types of organisms such as crops, pests, and biological
              control
agents.  The project is focused primarily on edge-mediated
effects in
              habitat fragments and on the effects of nonrandom
dispersal.  The main goal is
              to gain insight into the ways that
edge-mediated effects and dispersal
              behavior influence the
persistence or extinction of species.  Understanding
              edge-mediated
effects is important because one of the most significant ways
              in
which humans alter natural environments is by fragmenting
habitats and
              thus creating edges.  The investigators study many
spatial effects, including
              edge-mediated effects, via
reaction-diffusion models.  However,
              reaction-diffusion models
assume random dispersal, and the dispersal patterns
              of some
organisms are affected by behavioral responses to the presence
              of
prey, predators, or conspecifics.  Reaction-diffusion equations
cannot
              capture those effects, so the investigators model them
with more general forms
              of quasilinear parabolic partial
differential equations.  The investigators
              use methods and
results from the theory of partial differential
              equations,
dynamical systems, and nonlinear functional analysis to
              develop
the mathematical framework needed to analyze the models.
     The
              investigators study mathematical models for the ways
that plant and animal
              populations are affected by the size and
spatial structure of the environment
              they inhabit and by the way
they move or spread through the environment.  The
              goal of the
project is to gain a better theoretical understanding of
              how
spatial effects influence the persistence or extinction of
populations. 
              The underlying motivation is to provide insights
into the impact of spatial
              effects on biodiversity and on
economically important organisms such as crops
              and pests.  The
potential practical benefits of the project are improvements
              in
decision making in areas such as land management, conservation,
and urban
              planning.  Much of the project is focused on the
effects of habitat edges,
              because one of the main effects of
human activity on the environment is to
              divide it into fragments
and create edges, for example by building roads. 
              Different
organisms respond to edges in different ways; for example, a
              new
road may isolate a population of one species of animals that
refuse to
              cross it but may add to the mortality of another
species of animals that do
              attempt to cross.  When population
interactions such as predation by one
              species upon another are
combined with spatial effects, the results can be
              complex and
sometimes counterintuitive.  To understand them the
              investigators
derive mathematical equations that incorporate spatial
              effects
and population interactions and analyze those equations to
determine
              when they predict persistence of populations versus
when they predict
              extinction.  To conduct the analysis the
investigators use and develop various
              mathematical methods.
