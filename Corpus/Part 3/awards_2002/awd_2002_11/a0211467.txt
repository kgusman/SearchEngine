Multi-neuronal encoding of visual target
              information to direct flight in the dragonfly

	A remarkable example of
              visually guided interception flight is the capture of flying insect prey by
              dragonflies.  Prey interception flights are highly accurate, with capture
              success rates as high as 97%.  Using a combination of techniques, including
              multi-neuronal recordings with nanofabricated electrode arrays and high speed
              video analysis of wing movements, this project is aimed at understanding the
              neural guidance system used to direct this rapid, precise, visually-guided
              behavior.  Because prey pursuit is directed by a small number of easily
              accessible neurons, the dragonfly experimental preparation is ideally suited
              for answering a fundamental question in neurobiology:  does the correlation of
              firing patterns among neurons communicate more information than could be
              communicated by the neurons individually? An understanding of prey interception
              by dragonflies, from neurons to behavior, could lead to the development of
              effective biomimetic guidance mechanisms. In addition, this project will give
              undergraduate students a cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary, research experience,
              providing a vehicle for recruiting talented, enthusiastic students from both
              biology and engineering into the field of neuroscience.
