Description: This award is to support a collaborative
              project by Dr. Magdy Bayoumi, Director, The Center for Advanced Computer
              Studies (CAS) at University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Louisiana and Dr. Samia
              Mashali, Professor of Computer Engineering at the Electronics Research
              Institute (ERI), Cairo, Egypt.  They plan to focus on the development of novel
              algorithms, methods, and a hardware/software prototype for compressed-domain
              feature extraction using an existing wavelet coder infrastructure.
              Specifically, these investigators will develop algorithms and techniques for
              calculating texture and shape attributes from images and videos compressed with
              the JPEG2000 and motion-JPEG2000 compression standards. The novelty of the
              proposed method lies in its employment of a wavelet-based approach as opposed
              to the standard DCT methods, the addressing of texture and shape features which
              have received limited attention in the literature, and the emphasis on hardware
              solutions to further enhance the computation and memory reductions achieved
              with compressed-domain techniques.

Scope: 
The necessity of compression for
              storage coupled with the need to efficiently process the
compacted data has
              led to a great need for compressed-domain methods in which data can be
              processed without decoding.  The U.S. PI is well known in the area of VLSI
              Signal processing and has done work in architectures wavelet and other
              transforms.  He and his students have demonstrated how to extract textual
              features for wavelet-compressed images.  The project will involve training of
              students at the University of Louisiana and ERI.  It will help ERI develop a
              video compression laboratory that will benefit industrial sectors in Egypt and
              other countries in the Middle East.  This project is being supported under the
              US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers
              in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.
