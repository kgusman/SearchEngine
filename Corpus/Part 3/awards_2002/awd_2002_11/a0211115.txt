Abstract    :
              Despite current interest in tropical forests as key components of the global
              carbon
cycle and as centers of biodiversity,we remain largely ignorant of the
              inter-relationships
among forest attributes
              (e.g.,dynamics,diversity,structure),and the physical properties
of the
              environments in which these forests grow.In recent years datasets have
              become
available describing growth,mortality and recruitment of approximately
              10%of the
global diversity of tropical tree species.These data result from the
              development of a
network of large-scale forest dynamics plots coordinated by
              the Center for Tropical
Forest Science (CTFS),and established using methods
              identical to those used to survey
and census the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on
              Barro Colorado Island (BCI),Panama.
Just as data from the BCI plot have played
              a prominent role in our understanding of the
community-level consequences of
              ecological processes played out at local scales,we will
show how these plots
              now provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine a venerable
question in
              tropical ecology:How do soil-borne resources influence the variation in
              forest
structure and demographic turnover rates observed among plots,and among
              habitat types
within plots?
To achieve this objective we propose three sets
              of measurements.At nine plot
sites we will characterize variation in
              soil-moisture availability through the year and
throughout the plots using a
              hydrological model (TOPMODEL).This model predicts
soil-moisture saturation
              deficit based on rainfall,stream-flow data and local topography.
Second,at
              five plots currently lacking soils data we will sample soil-chemical
              properties
within standardized,topographically-defined habitat types.Third,at
              the same plots we
will perform seedling growth experiments using mycorrhizal
              and non-mycorrhizal
pioneer species to assess plant-availability of soil
              nutrients for each habitat type.These
measurements will allow us to address
              questions at two spatial scales.At the among-plot
scale we will be able to ask
              how stem density and basal area,as well as community-wide
patterns of
              growth,mortality and recruitment,correlate with moisture availability and
              soil
fertility.At the within-plot scale we will ask whether species exhibit
              specialization to
particular hydrological niches,and whether habitat types
              differ in soil fertility,in
turnover rates,and in local species
              richness.Resolution of these broad questions
concerning correlations among
              soil-borne resources and characteristics of the vegetation
will in turn permit
              us to refine future hypotheses aimed at understanding the mechanistic
basis
              for interspecific variation in demographics and distribution.
This study will
              provide the first standardized large-scale measurements of the
environmental
              context within which tropical forests grow.Our trans-continental approach
to
              testing questions of ecosystem function and community organization has rarely
              been
attempted,but it will be essential if we are to improve our understanding
              of the
biogeographic and biophysical limits to our ecological
              generalizations.Understanding
how variation in water and nutrient availability
              determines forest structure,composition
and dynamics,and potentially
              influences local diversity through niche partitioning,will
be essential to
              predicting future vegetation responses to climate change and will also
provide
              a first step in guiding management to protect forest diversity.Wide
              dissemination
and application of the results of this project is ensured by the
              active participation of in-
country collaborators,and by data sharing through
              CTFS.
