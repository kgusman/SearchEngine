Abstract    :
              The PIs request LTREB support to continue experimental studies in the Chihuahuan
              Desert
near Portal, Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced plots,
              each 0.25 ha in
area. They have maintained the removal of some or all species
              of rodents and/or ants from
10 plots continuously since 1977 and from an
              additional 4 plots since 1988. Standardized
censuses of rodents, ants, and
              plants provide invaluable data on responses of individuals,
populations, and
              communities both to experimental perturbations and to background temporal
and
              spatial variation in the environment.

Results to date demonstrate: 1)
              complex interannual and seasonal dynamics of rodent, ant,
and plant
              populations; 2) direct effects of seed predation by rodents, birds, and ants
              on
winter annual plants; 3) direct effects of competition by kangaroo rats on
              population
densities and species diversity of other seed-eating rodent
              species; 4) indirect effects
of kangaroo rats on vegetation, other rodents,
              birds, and lizards; 5) reorganization of
the entire ecosystem, including large
              increases in woody vegetation and extinctions,
colonizations, or shifts in
              abundance of many animal species, apparently caused by a
change in climate
              since the late 1970's; 6) regulation of emergent properties, such as
species
              diversity, biomass, and energy use of rodents and plants, within narrow
              bounds
despite large shifts in species composition in response to
              environmental change. 

The proposed research for the next five years
              includes: 1) continuation of experimental
manipulations and standardized
              censuses of rodents, ants, and plants; 2) focus on spatial
patterns and
              processes over a wide range of scales; 3) investigation of the
              experimental
manipulations and functional groups of organisms on ecosystem
              processes; 4) examination of
the dynamics of the ant community; and 5)
              assessment of the interacting influences of
climate, livestock grazing, and
              fire on the transition between desert shrubland and arid
grassland.
