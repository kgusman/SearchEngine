     The investigator is developing multiphasic models
              for
mechanical interactions between the cells and extracellular
matrix in
              articular cartilage.  A combination of analytical and
numerical methods are
              used to solve: (1) contact problems that
model experiments used to determine
              mechanical properties of
isolated cell (chondrocyte) and cell-matrix
              (chondron) units, (2)
interface problems that model local cell-matrix
              mechanics of the
chondron in vivo, and (3) fast boundary integral models
              for
transmission of mechanical signals in a tissue layer populated
with many
              cells.  Through collaboration with an orthopaedic
research lab, the models
              developed by the investigator are being
applied to: (a) the determination of
              material properties of cell
and tissue explants using in-vitro micropipette
              testing and video
microscopy, and (b) the simulation of local cell-matrix
              mechanics
and comparison to confocal microscopy of dynamic loading in
              a
tissue layer.  A fundamental goal of this project is to quantify
the
              dependence of local cell mechanics on external loading.  By
correlating
              experimental measurements of cell metabolic activity
to mechanical components
              of the local cell environment, the
complex relationship between tissue
              metabolism and cell mechanics
is analyzed.  Variations in chondron material
              and geometric
properties, within and across a variety of tissue
              populations,
are also incorporated into the models.  This project
              contributes
to understanding of the role of mechanics in maintenance of
              the
extracellular matrix, and associated matrix degeneration with
aging due
              to osteoarthritis.
     Articular cartilage is the primary load-bearing tissue
              in
joints such as the knee, shoulder and hip.  Degeneration of
cartilage
              leads to osteoarthritis, a painful condition that
affects millions of
              Americans and is predominantly associated
with aging.  Under repeated loading,
              the structural matrix of
cartilage is in a continual state of turnover that is
              regulated
by specialized cells called chondrocytes.  These cells
              synthesize
matrix components yet, remarkably, have no neural connection
              to
the brain.  As a result, cell metabolic activities directed at
repairing
              the structural matrix are highly dependent on the local
cell environment.  In
              this project, a mathematical modeler
collaborates with an orthopaedic research
              lab to understand the
role of mechanical forces in the maintenance of
              cartilage.  At
the cellular level, forces in cartilage result from a
              complex
coupling of solid and fluid mechanics with energy
              dissipation.
Results of this work predict the dependence of local forces
              at
the cellular scale on external loading.  Local force
              predictions
facilitate a quantitative description of the complex
              relationship
between cell metabolic activity and cell mechanics. 
              In
conjunction with associated experiments for a variety of
              tissue
populations, the models lead to an understanding of how
              these
remarkable cells can maintain cartilage over the course of a
lifetime,
              and how structural degeneration of cartilage is
initiated in osteoarthritis.
