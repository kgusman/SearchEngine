              ICHMM 2003 Participant Support Program Abstract
D.L. McDowell, Georgia Tech,
              Co-Chair of ICHMM 2003
The International Conference on Heterogeneous Material
              Mechanics (ICHMM 2003), to be held June 24-29, 2003 in China
              (http://www.ichmm.org), will highlight contemporary and emerging research
              directions of Asian, North American and European solid mechanics communities. 
              It will provide both a traditional format in ChongQing (2.5 days), followed by
              working workshop-format sessions aimed at emergent research issues (2.5 days)
              on a cruise down the YangTze River. It is proposed that the US NSF provide
              $15,000 in participant support costs to foster attendance of key western
              participants. Tremendous cultural and technical diversity are major themes of
              the ICHMM 2003; we will encourage participation of underrepresented groups. 
              The final report will include the list of participants and conference schedule,
              summary of panel discussions, and extended abstracts.  ICHMM 2003 will have
              profound impact on scientific and cultural exchange of leading international
              segments of the solid mechanics community. The novel format of this meeting
              will illuminate issues in emerging areas of common research emphasis (materials
              by design, nanomechanics, biomaterials, etc.) through both panel discussions
              and informal exchanges during the YangTze River segment.
