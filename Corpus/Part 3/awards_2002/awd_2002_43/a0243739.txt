Abstract    :
              The focal points of this interdisciplinary summer research experience are land
              conservancy and resource management.  Students will develop projects
              specifically addressing the needs of two local nature preserves, located within
              15 miles of Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA.  Under the supervision of a
              research mentor, participants will work in collaborative teams of two students.
               During the first two weeks of the10-week program, students will learn the
              basic information and skills (e.g., introduction to the preserves, ecological
              and social sciences methods, how to create a GIS database) necessary to develop
              their research projects.  During the following seven weeks students will
              collect and analyze data as well as attend two series of seminars (one on
              current research in environmental studies, one on ethical issues).  The last
              week of the program will be devoted to writing up and presenting the results of
              projects.  Additional collegial interactions will take place during weekly
              dinners and field trips.  Finally, students will have the opportunity to
              present their research to the local community and have their work included in
              the environmental education programs of the preserves.  Participants will be
              exposed to the broader context of this research and to the social issues
              involved in the management of nature preserves.  Moreover, this work will
              provide useful information for the local preserves and show the general public
              the value of basic and applied research.  Interested students should contact: 
              Dr. Veronique A. Delesalle, Department of Biology, Gettysburg College,
              Gettysburg, PA 17325; Tel. 717-337-6153; email: delesall@gettysburg.edu.
