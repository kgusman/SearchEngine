Abstract    :
              Support is requested to complete the research for a book dealing with the
              Japanese scientific community and the Nobel Prizes during the first half of the
              twentieth century. The book will have ten chapters in all, seven case study
              chapters of eight Japanese Nobel candidacies (two combined in one chapter) and
              additional chapters discussing the social, political, and intellectual context
              of the project; Japanese scientists' activities as Nobel nominators; and the
              conclusions drawn from the study. The time parameters reflect the Nobel
              institution's 50-year rule regarding use of archival materials. Conception of
              the project reflects earlier historical work on the creation of a modern
              tradition of scientific research in Japan after 1868 but with some attention to
              developments in the preceding centuries. It is also informed by the intense
              public and professional interest in the Nobel Prizes evident in Japan since
              1981. Although the physicist Yukawa Hideki succeeded in winning a Nobel Prize
              in 1949, several other strong Japanese candidates were unsuccessful in the
              period. A number of essays and short books have briefly discussed some of these
              candidacies but never with any use of archival materials. These commentaries
              often assume that each Japanese candidate was wrongly denied an award, and that
              some form of racism was likely responsible. While not denying that racism
              existed at the time among some in the international scientific community and
              acknowledging that such beliefs could sometimes have influence, this study
              broadens the frame of reference and advances several other factors to explain
              developments: Japanese factionalism, meddling by Japanese officials, the shift
              away from German and French and toward English after World War I, and Japanese
              concentration in medicine, a particularly broad, highly competitive research
              arena.
