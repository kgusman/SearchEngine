Abstract    :
              The series of annual summer activities of the Center for Game Theory in
              Economics is designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in research on
              game theory and its applications, and to make conceptual and methodological
              developments in game theory available to an expanding group of scientists in
              economics and other disciplines.   Each summer there are research-oriented
              conferences and workshops and, upon occasion, an intensive course of
              instruction on a topic of major significance, complemented by a further period
              of informal research activities. This series brings together a large
              international group of researchers--a mix of established scholars, junior
              faculty, and graduate students--whose interests represent a diverse array of
              theoretical and applied aspects of game theory.   The programs for 2003-2005
              are a continuation of the series of summer activities held at Stony Brook from
              1990 to 2002, each of which attracted about 120 participants on average. Formal
              activities normally include a five-day conference with plenary and parallel
              sessions, and invited and contributed papers; two workshops on selected themes;
              and from time to time one to two weeks of intensive instruction on selected
              topics. The value of this format and approach is evidenced by the success of
              the previous programs.
