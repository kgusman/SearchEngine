Abstract    :
              
In many cities of the US public officials are demolishing public housing and
              relocating poor families into dispersed private housing, following a program
              called HOPE IV whose goal is to "deconcentrate" poverty. Two competing models
              predict different outcomes from this relocation: Social Disorganization (SD)
              asserts that public housing projects generate negative social capital and that
              escape will relieve those problems, and further that relocation neighborhoods
              will afford new social opportunities and access to new valuable information. 
              Cooperative Assets (CA) regards the social ties of public housing to be
              positive assets embedded in kinship and locality networks, so that relocation
              will harm reciprocal support arrangements, and further that relocation
              neighborhoods will be hostile or at minimum unfamiliar, so the net effect of
              relocation will be to harm families. 
This study by a team of cultural
              anthropologists from the University of South Florida will measure the social
              networks of a sample of affected households in two sites in Tampa, Florida,
              representing the most typical receiving areas to HOPE VI programs.  Methods
              include formal interviews with a random sample of 100 households and their
              non-HOPE neighbors, participant observation and semi-structured key-person
              interviews and documentary analysis to establish a statistical profile of each
              site.  The results will be valuable to planners as well as to affected
              communities, to inform public policy as well as to help participant households
              cope with the problems of adjustment to relocation.
