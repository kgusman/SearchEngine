Abstract    :
              There have been only two basic economic regimes in history. Until perhaps 1800
              all 
societies were in the Malthusian regime with slow productivity growth,
              and fertility-determined living standards. Then came the Industrial Revolution
              and the world of modern growth, with 
rapid and persistent productivity gains.
              Recently economists have constructed many theoretical models to explain this
              transition.  A void exists, however, between theory and empirics. While models
              have multiplied, we are still ignorant of the economic aggregates for any
              country before 1830. Even in England, the best-documented pre-industrial
              economy, there are no national income estimates before 1700. Those for
              1700-1860 are weakly based, and were last significantly improved in 1985.   The
              materials exist, however, to estimate all the major economic aggregates for
              England to 1260, including skilled and unskilled wages, land rents, capital
              returns, real output, output per capita, factor shares, aggregate Total Factor
              Productivity (TFP) growth rates, TFP growth for many sectors of the economy,
              and tax revenues. English institutional stability allowed much better survival
              of records than elsewhere. And many of these materials are accessible because
              of earlier incomplete efforts to assemble price and wage histories of England,
              such as those of Rogers and Beveridge.   This project completes that task. The
              investigator has been working on estimating these aggregates for a number of
              years. He has completed papers on many of the components needed: agricultural
              wages (1210-1869), house rents (1550-1869), the housing stock (1550- 1869),
              farmland rents (1210-1869), prices for 22 farm outputs (1500-1869), returns on
              capital (1150-1869), days worked per worker (1560-1869). This project would
              seek first the completion of the required series, adding fresh archival
              information where necessary. Second it will put them together to form the
              national aggregates. The resulting series, the national economic aggregates for
              England all the way from 1260 to 1860, as well as the underlying data, will be
              made available to scholars through a web page. 

The preliminary estimates
              are surprising. The break in TFP productivity growth rates 
circa 1770 is much
              less dramatic than has been assumed. More dramatic accelerations in TFP
              
growth rates can be observed: first around 1600 and second around 1860. Also
              before 1860 the connection between the underlying rate of technological
              innovation and TFP advance depended 
on largely accidental factors. Further
              there are important changes in variables like rates of return on capital and
              the skill wage premium long before the Industrial Revolution period.
