Abstract    :
              This grant explores how alloying additions and crystal structure influence
              magnetostriction in Fe and Fe-Ga based alloys. The influences of selected
              alloying elements with no d-shell electrons, with filled d-shells, and with
              partially filled d-shells are examined using single crystals and directionally
              solidified polycrystalline alloys. The influence of crystal structure is
              examined using a Fe-27.5 a% Ga alloy that can exist in a"-ordered (bcc),
              DO19-ordered (hexagonal), L12-ordered (fcc), and disordered-bcc structures.
              Another principal goal of this work is to examine a low cost thermomechanical
              processing approach to produce [001] textured Fe-Ga based polycrystalline
              alloys at low cost. The processing approach involves cold/warm deformation and
              recrystallization. An assessment of the influence of the amount of different
              process parameters on the nature of texture obtained in selected Fe-Ga alloys,
              and the mechanisms controlling the evolution of texture will be made.

The
              processing conditions that result in [001] texture are identified through a
              study of texture evolution during processing using Orientation Imaging
              Microscopy (OIM) in an SEM. The grant will result in an improved understanding
              of magnetostriction in Fe based alloys, and low cost and highly
              magnetostrictive alloys for use in sensor and actuator applications. The grant
              will also enhance the graduate and undergraduate educational, training, and
              recruitment activities.
