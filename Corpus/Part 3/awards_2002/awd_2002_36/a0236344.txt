Abstract    :
              Sulfolobus shibatae Virus (SSV) is a Crenarchaeal virus that exists in extreme
              thermal (greater than 80oC) and acidic (pH < 3.0) environments such as the ones
              found in Yellowstone National Park.  While SSV1 is the best characterized of
              any Crenarchaeal virus, the current understanding of these extremely unique
              viruses is very limited.  Genomic sequence analysis of SSVs and most other
              viruses from extreme thermal environments fails to find homologues in the
              publicly available data bases for the vast majority of the putative open
              reading frames (ORFs).  Thus, most of the SSV1 viral proteome, 30 of 34 ORFs,
              have yet to be assigned any function, and the roles that these proteins play in
              the viral life cycle remains a mystery.  Using X-ray crystallography, this
              project seeks to identify structural homologues for member of the SSV1
              proteome, thus providing insight into their possible function.  The structural
              studies are being supplemented by the production of polyclonal antisera for
              each of these proteins, with subsequent analysis of their expression patterns
              and function with respect to the viral life cycle.  Together, these data will
              begin to provide an understanding of the SSV1 life cycle at the molecular
              level.  

Broader Impact: Viruses of extreme thermophiles can serve as model
              systems for understanding the biochemistry and molecular biology required for
              life at high temperatures, thus this research will help to open a window onto
              some of the most fundamental processes of the still poorly understood
              Crenarchaeota. The structural biology investigated in this project will be
              incorporated in the undergraduate educational activities. Additionally, this
              project will provide outstanding training opportunities to students at
              different levels, including summer research experience for Native American
              students from Montana.
