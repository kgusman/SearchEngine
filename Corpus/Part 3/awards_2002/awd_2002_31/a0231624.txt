Abstract    :
              


Since September 11, 2001, major efforts are underway in the U.S. to update
              and improve emergency management capabilities, plans, and practices in order to
              deal with terrorism. Therefore, it is timely and important to critically
              analyze and connect past major disaster events and their outcomes. This project
              will document recent major defining terrorist events and the emergency
              management infrastructure of laws, regulations, practices, and expert systems
              that have evolved, during the period 1988-2001. This systematic examination of
              recent terrorist events and their outcomes will lay the groundwork for
              educators and practitioners seeking to understand past events and their
              outcomes and contribute to more informed decision-making in the future.

The
              approach will be to: 

? Systematically identify and analyze major defining
              events and document them in a narrative chronology;

? Identify and describe
              the major outcomes from each defining event, including (a) reports and studies;
              (b) legislation and regulations; and (c) policies, program and organizational
              changes;  and 

? Describe the causal relationships between the events and
              their major outcomes, to the extent that the information collected allows.
              

The final products of this six-month effort will include professional
              papers and journal articles. Also, the products will be available on a project
              website.
