Abstract    :
              


The project pairs new teachers with Fellows and Fellows with discipline
              mentors.  Throughout a summer and academic year they work together at UCLA in
              courses to address pedagogical issues and at our partner schools in the
              classrooms to implement the mathematics and science activities developed.  As
              part of the intellectual merits of this project, the GK-12 Fellows gain
              first-hand experience in designing and testing curricular materials; GK-12
              teachers refine their content knowledge as they collaborate with Fellows; and
              the high school and middle school students gain an enriched understanding of
              mathematics and science as well as an opportunity to interact with role models
              for careers in science and mathematics.  There are broad impacts for the
              Fellows, teachers and students involved.  The fellows, most of whom intend to
              pursue careers in higher education, are gaining useful teaching skills and
              pedagogical knowledge as well as developing abilities that will help them
              engage professionally in addressing the social issues that confront all urban
              schools.  During the three years of the project benefits will accrue to over
              120-150 first-year mathematics and science teachers who teach a total of over
              50,000 students in the most poorly performing schools in Los Angeles.  Over 200
              standards-aligned, inquiry-based mathematics and science activities that meet
              the needs of these students are being adapted or developed and then
              field-tested during the three years of this project.  This resource of edited
              materials with annotated teaching notes is being published during the course of
              the project and distributed electronically through the UCLA in LA web site
              (http://www.la.ucla.edu) a portal created by the University for the entire Los
              Angeles community.  Part of the support for this project comes from the
              Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences.
