Abstract    :
              In modern times, almost anything that uses electricity uses some form of
              embedded computing. Examples include answering machines, GPS systems,
              televisions, gas pumps, toys, stereos, refrigerators, automobiles, game boxes,
              cellular phones, cash registers, and clocks. Not only is embedded computing
              becoming more widespread, but the complexity of the computing is increasing.
              Many of the products listed above process complex multimedia, including signal
              acquisition, compression, and display, with a concurrent interface. A modern
              embedded computing course is needed to teach engineers about the technologies
              and designs that go into these kinds of devices. Computer vision topics have
              historically been taught in graduate courses, since few examples were being
              practiced in mainstream engineering. In recent years the incorporation of
              multimedia into embedded devices has drawn some vision topics into mainstream
              attention. This project develops an undergraduate course that incorporates
              relevant vision theory into the larger context of embedded computing.
              Traditional topics, such as processor types, dynamic power management, and
              real-time scheduling, are taught alongside relevant vision topics, such as
              codecs, concurrent interfaces, and multimedia signal acquisition, storage, and
              rendering. At Clemson University we are developing ECE 468L Embedded Computing
              along these lines. In lab work, the students program hardware to operate as a
              digital video camera. This project develops the evolving course materials and
              lab exercises into a prototype textbook, based upon student assessment and
              evaluation.
