Abstract    :
              This award supports a workshop to be held in conjunction with the 2003 NSF
              Design, Service and Manufacturing Grantees and Research Conference in
              Birmingham, Alabama, January 9 - 11, 2003.  It is expected that 60 invited
              participants will attend this 2 day workshop, including international
              participants. The objective of this workshop is to establish an integrated
              approach that captures the fundamentals of environmentally benign manufacturing
              (EBM), directed beyond finding particular solutions to problems, to the
              creation of a research agenda to achieve behavior that incorporates these fully
              integrated concepts. This workshop will take an educational and
              multidisciplinary approach to understanding attributes, and awareness of the
              use of, four topical areas as the basis of EBM. These areas are 1) product
              performance, / technology; 2) supply chain dynamics; 3) decision-making (with
              organizational dynamics) and 4) environment. These four threads are to be
              represented by individuals with expertise in each fields, who will then work on
              common product topics to create the framework for this integrated
              approach.

This workshop is a major step in implementing the findings of the
              Environmentally Benign Manufacturing World Technologies Evaluation Center
              (WTEC) study published in 2001.
