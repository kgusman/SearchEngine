Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              synthesis of new electrocatalysts from metallomacrocycles by the catalyzed
              pyrolysis of the complexes in mesoporous materials. It is anticipated that the
              approach will give rise to novel nanoparticulate carbon supported metals, which
              will be initially implemented in the advanced anode electrocatalysis of direct
              methanol oxidation fuel cells (DMFC) and in cathode electrochemistry as oxygen
              reduction catalysts. Thermal decomposition of these compounds is expected to
              result in atomic or small cluster metal active sites supported by and bound to
              nitrogeneous nanotube materials. Work proposed will consist of synthesizing the
              subject electrocatalysts followed by their electrochemical performance
              evaluation under representative proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell
              conditions for oxygen electroreduction and direct methanol
              oxidation.

Potential customers for these technology include automotive
              companies.  In additon, application to stationary power sources is also
              possible.  Consequently, electric power utilities would find interest in the
              proposed technology as well as power for commercial and industrial
              installations.
