Abstract    :
              This research is being done in conjunction with IIS-9731990, which is
              being
performed by Michael Pazzani in the Information and Computer
              Science
Department at the University of California, Irvine. The research
              is
concerned with intelligent decision aids that can be developed by
              data
mining techniques.  Experience has determined that such systems can
              learn
accurate models,  but that experts in areas where those models are used
              in
decision aids are often reluctant to trust them because they do not,
              for
instance, use the same tests intermediate conclusions or abstractions
              that
the experts have grown to trust.  Or they do not use certain factors at
              all
that experts feel to be relevant.  Experts also want models that are
              stable
under small changes in the data being analyzed.  Psychologists
              have
discovered factors that simplify the learning, understanding,
              and
communication of category and process information by humans.  This
              research
seeks to explore these psychological principles in light of the
              output of
existing KDD algorithms and then go on to develop and evaluate new
              KDD
algorithms that will provide output that is easy for people to learn ,
              use,
and communicate to others. With the results of this research, it should
              be
possible to make such decision aids more "human centered", so that
              they
will be used more often and more effectively in
              practice.
