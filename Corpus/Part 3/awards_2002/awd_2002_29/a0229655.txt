The upward migration of magma through shallow conduits
              plays an important role in volcanic activity, as the physical changes that
              magma undergoes during ascent may determine the style and intensity of the
              resulting eruption.  However, little is known about the shapes of volcanic
              conduits, their evolution through the course of an eruption, or the effect of
              conduit shape on rates of magma ascent. We propose to analyze conduit evolution
              during the 1992 eruptions of Mt. Spurr, Alaska, by using individual earthquakes
              to determine the stress field around the conduit for different phases of the
              eruptive sequence. This work will both complement and test results from the
              numerous seismic and petrologic studies already completed on the Spurr eruptive
              sequence. We are particularly interested in determining the stress state of the
              conduit during (1) the ten months of activity leading up to the first explosive
              event, (2) the intra-eruptive period [June - September 1992], and (3) the
              post-eruptive period.  Evaluation of these three time periods will allow us to
              evaluate conditions of magma ascent prior to eruptive activity, examine the
              response of the conduit to individual eruptions, and test the hypothesis that
              seismic swarms in November and December of 1992 were actually eruptions that
              "failed" because a solidified plug had formed at shallow levels. Our results
              will thus both provide insight into the 1992 eruptions at Mt. Spurr and aid
              development of a general model of stress field response to episodes of magma
              migration. Additionally, we will compare our results with those from a stress
              field study of dike emplacement at nearby Iliamna Volcano with the hope of
              shedding light on conditions that either promote or hinder propagation of
              intruding magma to the surface, thus improving interpretations of future
              seismic crises in volcanic regions.
