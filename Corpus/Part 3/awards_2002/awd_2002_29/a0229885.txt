Considerable progress has been made in mapping out
              lateral variation in the Earth, demonstrating the active dynamic processes
              going on beneath us.  Advances in seismic tomography in terms of travel time
              and waveform methodology has allowed major structures in the mantle to be
              determined.  Relatively fast velocities ring the Pacific derived from Global
              long-period studies and further resolution into sharper sheet-like features
              with shorter wavelength bodywaves and higher-mode efforts.  The velocities
              beneath the slowest lower mantle structures, mid-Pacific and South Africa can
              be modeled by a D" (roughly 300 km thick) with about 3% drop in shear velocity
              in basic agreement with some recent tomography studies.  Beneath southern
              Africa, a large structure about 1200 km across extends upward about 1500 kms
              with about the same S-velocity reduction of 3%.  The boundaries of this anomaly
              appear sharp enough to produce multipathing in SKS.  Recently released SKS data
              from the South African Array reveals jumps in SKS travel time of up to 8 secs,
              which can be contoured, delimiting the sharpness of this huge structure as it
              turns from a northwest direction to an east west direction beneath the Indian
              Ocean. To make accelerated progress in developing 3D images of this structure
              and a possible sister structure beneath the Pacific, the investigators plan a
              concentrated effort to construct whole mantle 2D cross sections by modeling
              waveform data along selected corridors.  Using their new waveform modeling
              tools in combination with the ever-expanding IRIS networks of PASSCAL arrays
              and fixed stations will allow them to address the following questions: How
              sharp are the sides of these huge structures and what is their 3D geometry; how
              uniform is the roof structure and does the Rayleigh number decrease 
              drastically to form fast moving smaller plumes interacting with the 660
              transition zone and can this be seen in distortions of the 670 km
              triplications; what is the fine-scale structure beneath the Pacific (SV and SH)
              and how is it related to the mid-mantle structure? The investigators purpose to
              address these issues with a broadband data gathering exercise followed by
              detailed modeling, including all body wave phases sampling selected
              corridors.
