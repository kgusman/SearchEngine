Abstract    :
              The AIBS project on "Infrastructure for Biology at Regional to Continental
              Scales" (IBRCS) has the following goals: (1) educate the scientific community
              about the need to increase physical infrastructure capacity for data
              collection, analysis, and database networking within and among field biology,
              other areas of biology, and other areas of  science; (2) provide for
              communications within the scientific community and with the National Science
              Foundation regarding the future development and focus of relevant
              infrastructure and data-networking projects, and (3) serve as a public
              information source on these projects. The scientific community will thereby
              become better able to determine the benefits and utility of particular existing
              or proposed infrastructure and data-networking projects to their areas of
              research. The AIBS IBRCS project will be led by a Working Group consisting of
              biologists from the AIBS membership of scientific societies and organizations,
              plus technical advisors from other areas of science.  

AIBS and the Working
              Group will:

- Summarize and evaluate past workshops on  relevant
              infrastructure and data-networking  projects, and maintain a rolling summary of
              future workshops and related activities.

- Conduct collaborative and
              consensus-generating activities, including Working Group meetings,
              joint-sessions at the annual AIBS Council meeting, workshops, presentation and
              discussion sessions at scientific conferences, and coalition meetings with
              other scientific organizations.  The goal is to involve many kinds of
              biologists and other scientists in thinking about and working together on
              scientific activities, questions, and applications that can be better addressed
              with enhanced infrastructure and data-networking capacities.
 
- Make the
              biological community aware of relevant infrastructure and data-networking
              activities in other scientific/technical communities such as geology,
              chemistry, toxicology, hydrology, remote sensing/GIS, engineering,
              nanotechnology, bio-sensors, mathematics, computer science, and data
              management/IT.

- Serve as a key source of information about relevant
              infrastructure and data-networking projects for the scientific community, the
              public policy community, the media, and the general public.  Included will be
              printed materials (brochures and reports), articles in the AIBS publication,
              BioScience, and a new website covering past activities (e.g., past workshop
              summaries and evaluations, etc.), present activities (e.g., current workshops
              and other meetings, reports, program announcements, lists of existing networks,
              a matching service for scientists seeking to partner with other PIs to develop
              funding proposals), and future activities (e.g., upcoming workshops and other
              meetings, etc.).
