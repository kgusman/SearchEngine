Understanding how the heat fluxes at Earth's surface and
              core-mantle-boundary (CMB) scale with the relevant parameters  is essential to
              understanding the thermal evolution of the mantle and core. This two-year
              project involves focused studies of two important but presently ill-determined
              aspects of heat transport, using the tool of numerical modeling. The first
              aspect is how CMB heat flux scales in the presence of plate tectonics. This is
              important because constraints from geodynamo energetics on the heat flow
              through the CMB indicate that the likely heat flow is much higher than that
              measured by buoyancy fluxes of observed hotspots, suggesting that other modes
              of core heat removal are important. It is thought that these other modes are
              most likely 'slab warming' (warming of cold subducted slabs resting above the
              CMB), and 'stealth plumes' (plumes that do not generate an observable signature
              at the surface). The relevant scalings in the presence of plate tectonics and
              strongly variable interior viscosity are not known, and will be the first focus
              of this investigation.  The second aspect is the effect of continents on
              surface heat flow. Continents have a "thermal blanketing" effect which affects
              the scaling of heat flux (Nu) with  Rayleigh number (Ra). However,  the effect
              of continents on this scaling has not been quantified, with  previous
              parameterized thermal evolution models simply reducing the standard Nu-Ra
              scaling in proportion to the fractional surface area covered by continents.
              Establishing the scaling of surface heat flow, internal temperature and
              velocities with continental (width, Biot number) and standard convective
              parameters will be the second focus of this project.
