Abstract    :
              Scientists often use models based on the climatic tolerances of species
              ("bioclimatic models") to predict the spread of newly introduced exotic species
              and to predict how the geographic ranges of species will change in response to
              climate change.  Although such models are conceptually simple and widely used,
              many scientists object to bioclimatic models because they ignore interactions
              between species (like predation and competition), the genetic structure of
              species, dispersal, complex relationships among climatic variables, and ranges
              that are not in equilibrium with climate.  Despite their importance and
              potential flaws, scientists have not evaluated the actual performance of
              bioclimatic models.

I will use information on the spread of exotic species
              in Europe and North America to test the performance of bioclimatic models.  I
              will select a wide range of species that have been introduced between the two
              continents and construct bioclimatic models based on the distribution of each
              species in its native range.  These bioclimatic models will then be applied to
              predict the range of each species in the continent to which it was introduced. 
              The predicted range will be compared to the actual range using several
              statistical measures, which will reveal the actual predictive abilities of
              bioclimatic models and diagnose likely causes of failures.
