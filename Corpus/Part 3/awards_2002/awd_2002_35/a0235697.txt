Abstract    :
              The project will use cutting edge genomic techniques to dissect the genetic
              basis of butterfly wing eyespot patterning. These eyespots consist of
              concentric rings of different colors, and have important ecological roles in
              both predator avoidance and mate choice.  Eyespots have long fascinated
              biologists and laymen alike. They are a particularly exciting model system as
              there is great diversity in these patterns within and between butterfly species
              and this diversity is amenable to analysis at different levels, including
              ecological, physiological, developmental, and genetical. The type of integrated
              approach that is possible with this system is of great value to biological
              research.

We will develop genomic tools that will allow us to explore
              variation in the wing patterns of Bicyclus anynana butterflies. These tools
              will include a library containing genes which are expressed in developing
              butterfly wings, and a genetic map made using DNA sequence polymorphisms in
              many of those genes. The genetic map will help us localize the genes which
              contribute to eyespot variation. These tools will be a valuable asset for the
              larger scientific community working on Lepidopterans (butterflies and moths). 
              Lepidopterans are still an understudied insect group despite their great
              positive (e.g., silkworms) and negative (e.g., many agricultural pests)
              economic impacts.
