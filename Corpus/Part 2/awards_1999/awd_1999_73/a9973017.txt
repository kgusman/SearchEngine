     The investigators study mathematical models for the
              dynamics
of spatially distributed biological populations.  The goal of
              the
project is to provide a better theoretical understanding of how
the
              spatial distribution and movement of individuals affect the
persistence or
              extinction of populations.  The motivation is to
gain insight into the ways
              that spatial effects contribute to the
maintenance of biodiversity and the
              ways that changes in the
spatial aspects of the environment can threaten
              biodiversity.
The project is primarily concerned with the construction
              and
analysis of models for edge-mediated effects and the development
of
              methods for translating assumptions about the behavior of
individuals on a
              small spatial scale into conclusions about the
dynamics of populations on a
              large spatial scale.  Edge-mediated
effects occur when the presence of an
              interface between habitat
types has an effect on population dynamics.  An
              example of an
edge-mediated effect might occur if a fragment of habitat
              were
cut off from a larger region by a road that some species would
cross but
              others would not.  If the presence of the edge (the
road) thus resulted in a
              change in the species composition of the
ecological community in the fragment,
              that would be an
edge-mediated effect.  Issues of scaling from local behavior
              to
large-scale conclusions arise in ecology because it is often
possible to
              determine small-scale behavior by observing a few
individuals, while directly
              observing the overall dynamics of a
large population is much more difficult. 
              The methodology of the
project is to construct mathematical models for
              spatially
distributed populations and then to analyze those
              models'
predictions of persistence or extinction for the species
              they
describe.  The mathematical models are typically based on
ordinary or
              partial differential equations.  The analysis
typically involves ideas from
              dynamical systems, nonlinear
functional analysis (especially bifurcation
              theory), and partial
differential equations (especially comparison methods
              and
elliptic spectral theory).  A secondary goal is to obtain
              new
mathematical results that are useful in the context of
applications.
   
               The investigators study ways of using mathematics to
understand ecological
              problems.  The problems mostly involve
spatial aspects of the environment; for
              example, how to design
the most effective nature reserves, or how to predict
              the likely
effects of the fragmentation of natural habitats on
              the
populations that inhabit them.  The problems also involve
interactions
              between different biological species, for example
predators and prey.  The
              methodology is to express the essential
features of a biological system in
              terms of equations and then to
study the equations to determine what they
              predict.  The analysis
often requires the development of new mathematical
              results, which
may be of use to other investigators.  A typical goal of
              the
analysis is to determine how various environmental and biological
factors
              affect the persistence or extinction of populations.  A
reason for using
              mathematical models is that in situations
involving endangered species,
              genetically engineered organisms,
or large scale environmental change, it is
              often impossible to do
experiments but crucial to have some idea of what to
              expect.
Some of the models are directly motivated by problems in
              refuge
design or pest control.  Others are motivated by basic
              scientific
questions about the effects of the spatial aspects of
environments
              on populations.  But even those may prove to be
relevant to issues raised in
              the contexts of environmental
protection and the biological effects of global
              change.  The
potential benefits of the project include improved
              decision
making in conservation, refuge design, land management, and
              urban
planning.
