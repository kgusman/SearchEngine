     The investigator develops mathematical models of
              several
problems arising in biology and medicine.  These include studies
of
              models of normal and cancerous cells considered as interacting
cell
              populations; investigations of normal and cancer cell
behavior in the bone
              marrow, blood, and the active and resting
phases of the cell cycle; studies of
              the inherent effects of time
lags in the development of the myelodysplastic
              syndromes (MDS)
and cancer; and studies of MDS and cancer from
              diffusion-oriented
viewpoints.  The treatment of cancer and MDS is looked at
              as a
formal optimization problem.  Various functions that represent
medical
              and financial costs to patients during treatment are
derived and minimized or
              maximized subject to constraining
ordinary differential equations.  Following
              this, techniques are
developed for controlling model equations that involve
              partial
differential equations.  Within this framework, optimal
              strategies
that address problems such as patient recuperation
              after
treatment, multidrug resistance, patient sensitivity to
anticancer
              agents, minimal residual disease, and low versus high
dose continuous
              infusions are considered.  Statistical and
probabilistic methods are used to
              manipulate and study cancer
data.  From the data, model parameters that
              describe cell growth
and death rates are estimated by employing concepts of
              the growth
fraction, cell cycle and flow cytometric measurements,
              and
apoptotic information.  Techniques are also developed for
estimating
              other relevant model parameters, such as measures of
contact inhibition
              between cells, from data.
     The objectives of the project include studies
              and modeling
of precancerous syndromes and disseminated cancers such as
              the
leukemias and lymphomas from a biomathematical viewpoint.  The
focus is
              on: a) Construction of mathematical models that
quantitatively and
              qualitatively shed light on mechanisms
inherent in the precancerous syndromes
              and disseminated cancers;
b) Studies and comparisons of various treatment
              protocols through
the use of predictive treatment optimization models with the
              view
to suggesting ways in which treatment could be improved.
Biomedicine is
              becoming increasingly quantitative in scope and
content as the fight against
              all kinds of diseases such as cancer
continues.  Nevertheless, the use of
              mathematical techniques that
are well suited for analyzing, synthesizing, and
              comprehending
such quantitative information are relatively limited in
              this
important area.  Also, clinicians and medical practitioners are
always
              faced with problems such as the exact length of time to
carry out treatment,
              infusions of the right amounts of drugs that
are adequate for patient
              recovery, and overall patient safety.
These issues demand that the best
              treatment strategies be found
when dealing with patients in the clinic.  The
              need also exists
for multidisciplinary approaches in tackling problems
              that
continually arise in the clinic.  It is within these frameworks
that
              mathematical modeling in the area of biomedicine assumes
significance and
              importance.  The mathematical models serve as a
first line of approach and a
              cost-effective way of gaining
insight into cancer and MDS without initially
              resorting to
expensive clinical trials.  The predictive nature of the
              models
gives the clinician various options about the specific way to
proceed
              in dealing with the problems of the patient.  It is
envisioned that knowledge
              gained from the research activities
will aid in the fight against cancer as a
              whole and have an
impact on clinical trails of new therapeutic strategies. 
              Such
knowledge will also have a positive impact on drug delivery
systems and
              the area of biomedical technology.
