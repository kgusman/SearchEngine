Abstract    :
              9970440

This proposal is concerned with diophantine equations in many
              variables, in the context of the theory and application of the Hardy-Littlewood
              (circle) method.  The proposer intends to pursue a number of investigations
              whose goal is an improved understanding of the existence and density of integer
              solutions of systems of homogeneous equations, and associated estimates for
              exponential sums of use in the circle method.  Two themes play a large role in
              proposed investigations.  In one direction, methods familiar from the
              application of the Hardy-Littlewood method to additive diophantine problems
              will be extended to handle diophantine equations more closely approximating
              general homogeneous equations.  Here the proposers methods for handling
              exponential sums over binary forms, and over smooth numbers, are significant.
              In a second direction, the more elementary diagonalisation methods, originating
              in work of Brauer and Birch, will be extended so as to obtain more refined
              conclusions concerning the density of rational solutions to systems of
              diophantine equations.

Number Theory studies the properties of integers
              (``whole numbers''). Since Antiquity, the study of diophantine equations
              (equations to be solved in integers) has formed a core component of Number
              Theory, and has recently influenced the development of codes and cryptosystems
              (applied, for example, in data storage systems such as compact disks,
              communications systems and banking security).
