ABSTRACT

The proposed research is to study specific q-series
              and
integer partitions. In particular new forms of the Bailey
transform are
              found which imply new multivariable Rogers-Ramanujan
identities. These forms
              will be related to work in statistic
mechanics. They also motivate new quintic
              transformations
which imply the Rogers-Ramanujan identities without the
              Jacobi
triple product identity. The q-Hermite polynomials motivate this
              work,
and several related integrals remain to be evaluated and applied to
              number
theory. They suggest many avenues of study for combinatorial
              enumeration,
including the positivity conjectures of Andrews and
              Borwein.



Suppose we have a positive integer, for example 12. We now
              split 12
into a sum of possibly smaller positive integers, for example
              12=5+2+2+2+1.
We always order the smaller integers from largest to
              smallest.
We call 5+2+2+2+1 an integer partition of 12. The total number of
              integer
partitions of a given integer is a number that mathematicians,
              physicists,
and chemists need to understand. Whenever particles of matter
              exhibit
symmetry,
this number can appear. In this research, several problems
              related to
integer partitions are considered. The basic technique of
              the
study is to consider certain functions instead of the
partitions
              themselves, and apply a higher version of calculus to these
functions.
