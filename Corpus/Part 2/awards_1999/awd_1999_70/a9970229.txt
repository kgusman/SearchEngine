Abstract    :
              The proposed research of Antonio Sa Barreto is divided in three main parts.
In
              the first topic, the investigator intends to study the
existence of resonances
              for second order self-adjoint perturbations of the
Euclidean Laplacian. 
              Secondly he intends to continue his research on
Scattering theory for
              asymptotically hyperbolic
manifolds.
Particular examples of such manifolds
              are the hyperbolic space and its
quotients
by certain discrete groups of
              linear fractional transformations. The methods
used here can also be applied
              to study scattering for perturbations of the
De Sitter-Schwarzschild model of
              black holes.  The principal investigator
will  study the distributions of
              resonances and
the connection between the resonances and the trace of the wave
              group.
In the third topic, the investigator proposes to study what type
              of
information can be obtained from the scattering matrix in
              several
different situations.
He proposes to consider the question of
              existence
of transparent metric perturbations of the Euclidean metric, i.e
              those that
are not determined by the scattering
matrix at  a fixed energy. He
              also intends to consider the question of
determination of a non-compactly
              supported metric perturbation, that have
sufficient decay at infinity, from
              the
knowledge of the scattering matrix at  all energies.
The same questions
              can be posed in non-Euclidean settings, as for example,
for metric and
              potentials defined on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.
As metioned above,
              this is in some sense the case of
the De Sitter-Schwarzschild model of black
              holes. One would like to know if
a time independent perturbation of this model
              by a metric and potential can be
recovered from the scattering matrix at all
              energies.


The general idea of the first project in this proposal is to
              study, in
different situations, the effects that certain
perturbations have
              on a medium. For example how certain
disturbances will affect the propagation
              of light or sound.  Resonances
can be seen as a damping effect the
              perturbation has on the propagation of
waves. The third project concerns the
              reciprocal of this question, i.e
knowing the effects that an unknown
              perturbation has on a medium, determine
the the perturbation.  In the second
              project the investigator will study
analogous questions for the case where the
              medium is ``asymptotically
hyperbolic''.  A closely related and important
              example is the
De Sitter-Schwarzschild model of black holes.
