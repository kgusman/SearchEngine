Let (X,H) denote a compact, odd dimensional manifold with a
contact
              structure, H. The basic examples are (1) The co-sphere
bundle of a compact
              manifold, (2) The strictly pseudoconvex
boundary of a complex manifold.  Any
              contact manifold has a
distinguished algebra of pseudo-differential operators
              called the
Heisenberg algebra.  Epstein and Melrose, building on work
              of
Boutet de Monvel and Guillemin, identified a family of order
              zero
projection operators in the Heisenberg algebra, generalizing the
Szego
              projector defined on the boundary of a complex manifold.
They established that
              if S, S' are two such projectors then the
projection defined by S from the
              image of S' to the image of S is
a Fredholm map.  Let i(S,S') denote the index
              of this
restriction.  We call this the relative index.  By
              considering
Heisenberg operators which act on vector bundles, many
              classical
index problems can be re-phrased as relative index problems
              for
pairs of generalized Szego projectors.  The main thrust of the
proposed
              research is to obtain formulae for the relative index in
terms of more
              classical geometric invariants, such as indices of
Dirac operators and
              holomorphic Euler characteristics.  A general
relative index formula of this
              type will allow Epstein and
Melrose to completely settle the general case of
              the
Atiyah-Weinstein problem, asking for a geometric formula for the
index of
              an FIO defined by a contact diffeomorphism between two
co-sphere bundles. 
              Beyond this the investigator plans to search
for analytic invariants of
              contact structures.  Using an approach
suggested by Lempert and an extension
              of the Heisenberg algebra
he hopes to obtain a second formula for i(S,S'),
              which should be
useful in studying the small embeddable deformations of
              the
CR-structure on a strictly pseudoconvex, compact CR-manifold.

Partial
              differential equations are the principal tool for
mathematical descriptions of
              problems in physics, chemistry,
economics, etc., and it is a fundamental
              problem to decide how
many solutions, if any, such an equation has.  In
              general this
problem is too delicate to solve exactly, but there is a
              number
called the Fredholm index which can estimate the number of
solutions. 
              The main result in this subject is the "Atiyah-Singer
Index Theorem."  The
              research proposed by Epstein is concerned
with extending these ideas to more
              general classes of equations
which arise in the context of "contact
              manifolds," a natural
arena for problems in mechanics and control theory. 
              Analytical
tools are being developed which should have many
              applications
beyond the formula for the Fredholm index.
