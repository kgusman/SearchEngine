We propose to study certain groups that are associated with
              algebraic
curves over finite fields. The groups in question can be viewed as
              the
automorphism groups of unramified coverings of a fixed algebraic curve
              
over a finite field which is also fixed throughout the discussion. 
As we
              let vary the coverings we obtain a system of groups, which is
called the
              algebraic fundamental group of the curve; this concept was 
introduced by
              Grothendieck. The algebraic fundamental group mixes in
a fascinating way the
              arithmetic of the finite field and the geometry
of the curve in question. In
              particular, one can associate to a
point on the curve a certain conjugacy
              class in this group, consisting
of the so-called Frobenius elements. The
              question which we would like
to answer is: What is the (relative) position of
              these Frobenius elements
in the group? 

The general area of research of the
              project is Arithmetic Algebraic
Geometry.  Roughly speaking, the Algebra
              refers to the fact that we
work mainly with polynomials as far as functions
              are concerned.
We define geometric objects byequating to zero a few of these
              
polynomials. Such an object is called an algebraic set or a variety. 
It
              turns out that there is a surprisingly rich geometry of these 
objects,
              especially if we consider equations in higher dimensions 
and of higher
              degree. The arithmetical aspect comes into play 
when we consider only those
              polynomials which have integers
(or rational numbers) as coefficients.  These
              objects have wide-ranging
applications in number theory, geometry, and the
              theory of data security.
