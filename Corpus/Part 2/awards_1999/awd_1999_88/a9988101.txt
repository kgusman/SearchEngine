Title: Cohomology state-sum invariants in dimensions
              3 and 4
PI: Masahiko Saito, University of South Florida

Abstract:

New
              state-sum invariants for knots in 3-dimensional space and
knotted surfaces in
              4-dimensional space are defined by the
principal investigator and
              collaborators as follows.
A finite quandle is chosen. Its elements are
              assigned to arcs
of knot diagrams (or regions of knotted surfaces) as
              colors,
where the quandle condition holds at every crossing.
Weights in the
              form of quandle cocycles, then, are assigned to
crossings (or triple points),
              the product of weights are taken
over all crossings (or triple points), and
              the sum is taken over
all possible colorings. The resulting expression is the
              state-sum
invariant. The state-sum invariant can detect non-invertibility
of
              knotted surfaces. Similar state-sum invariants are defined for
triangulated
              4-manifolds, using colors and weights from a cohomology
theory of quantum
              double of finite groups. Our project is to compute,
interprete, and apply
              these new invariants. Relations to other theories,
such as Seiberg-Witten
              invariants, spin-foam models of quantum gravity,
are expected. Higher
              categorical structures are also investigated in
relation to topological
              quantum field theories.


A knot is a circle situated in space. Knot theory
              studies differences
among such knotted circles, and has applications to DNA
              theory and
physics. When a knot is drawn on a piece of paper with
              self-crossing
points (called crossings), it is called a knot diagram.
One of
              the methods in knot theory is to assign numbers (called colors)
to arcs in a
              knot diagram with certain rules imposed, assign weights
on crossings, and
              compute a number called the state-sum, by taking
sum and product of weights
              with respect to all possible colorings.
The idea of state-sums came from
              statistical mechanics.
Instead of numbers, abstract algebraic systems can be
              used as colors.
The principal investigator and collaborators discovered a new
              state-sum
which can also be defined for higher dimensional knots ---
              knotted
surfaces in 4-dimensional space. They also discovered a similar
              state-sum
for 4-dimensional geometric objects, that are divided into small
              4-dimensional
tetrahedra. The project is to compute, interprete, and apply
              these
new state-sums. The investigation requires developing an
              intricate
understanding of the algebraic structures that are used as
              colors,
and the geometric study of properties of the state-sums. Relations
              to
other physical theories are expected.
