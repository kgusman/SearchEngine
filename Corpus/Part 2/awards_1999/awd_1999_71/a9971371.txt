The
              proposed research is directed to problems in moduli theory of
Riemann
              surfaces, algebraic curves defined over the field of
algebraic numbers,
              geometry of Hermitian matrix integrals, and
integrable nonlinear partial
              differential equations. The goals
are (1) To give an explicit combinatorial
              description of
infinitesimal deformations of a compact Riemann surface in
              terms
of deformations of graphs on the topological model of the
surface. This
              will establish a canonical diffeomorphism between
the differentiable orbifold
              structure of the moduli space of
pointed Riemann surfaces that is obtained by
              the Strebel theory
and the algebro-geometric construction over the field of
              complex
numbers. (2) To find an algebraic and combinatorial description
of
              the relation between ribbon graphs and Riemann surfaces. It is
proposed to
              study an algebro-geometric counterpart of a ribbon
graph with complex edge
              length. This study is expected to lead to
a discovery of algebraic description
              of the relation between
ribbon graphs and Riemann surfaces. (3) To establish a
              theory of
transcendental solutions of the KP equations. A class of
              matrix
integrals give totally new solutions of the KP equations which
are not
              obtained by the generalized higher-rank Krichever
construction. These matrix
              integrals include generating functions
of the orbifold Euler characteristics
              of the moduli spaces of
pointed Riemann surfaces.

The motion of any
              string-like object in space-time leads to a
Riemann surface as it sweeps out
              some region. The DNA strands in
our body, for example, come from our
              ancestors. We can imagine a
DNA loop, that was created a long time ago, has
              been traveling in
time and now stored in our cell. The whole history of
              this
particular DNA is described by a Riemann surface. The time slice
of the
              surface is the DNA at this particular time. We do not know
the exact past of
              our genes. But we can consider the collection
of all possible scenarios that
              would end up with the current
structure of our DNA. This collection is the
              moduli space of
Riemann surfaces. Deeper analysis of the collection of
              all
possible past of our genes through studying the moduli spaces is
expected
              to lead us to a better understanding of molecular
evolution of DNA.  Because
              of its connections to string theory in
high energy physics and potential
              applications to molecular
evolution of DNA, graduate and undergraduate
              students show strong
interests in this research, which interweaves algebra,
              geometry
and analysis.
