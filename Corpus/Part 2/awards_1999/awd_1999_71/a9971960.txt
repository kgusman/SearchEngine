The
              goal of this project is to better understand the Penrose
Conjecture in General
              Relativity, which is closely related to the
Positive Mass Theorem.  Both
              statements can be thought of as
attempts to describe the relationship between
              the local energy
density of a space-time N (whose metric has signature 3,1)
              and
the total mass of N.  In physical terms, the Positive Mass
Theorem states
              that an isolated gravitational system with
nonnegative local energy density
              must have nonnegative total
energy.  The idea is that nonnegative energy
              densities must "add
up" to something nonnegative.  The Penrose Conjecture, on
              the
other hand, states that if an isolated gravitational system
              with
nonnegative local energy density contains black holes
contributing a
              mass m, then the total energy of the system must
be at least m.  These
              compelling physical statements translate
into highly nontrivial geometric
              statements about asymptotically
flat manifolds with nonnegative scalar
              curvature.  The Positive
Mass Theorem was not proven until 1979 by Schoen and
              Yau, and the
most general version of the Penrose Conjecture is still
              open.
The investigator recently proved the Riemannian Penrose
Conjecture,
              which is the Penrose Conjecture for a 3-dimensional
space-like hypersurface M
              of N with zero second fundamental form.
The proof uses a new approach to the
              problem (which came out of
research supported by the NSF), and the theorem is
              the strongest
version of the Penrose Conjecture proved to date.  This
              research
aims to extend these results to prove the most general version
              of
the Penrose Conjecture, where the hypersurface M is not required
to have
              zero second fundamental form.  It is also hoped that
these new techniques can
              be used to understand higher dimensional
cases and the behavior of quasi-local
              mass in General Relativity.

Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is one
              of two primary
theories (along with Quantum Mechanics) thought to best
              describe
the laws of physics.  In the long run, it is hoped that a
              better
understanding of the laws of physics will lead to advances which
could
              lead to a better standard of living for people.  Already,
fundamental advances
              in understanding the laws of physics have
made modern technology possible. 
              The research in this project
goes to the heart of the behavior of matter in
              General Relativity
and attempts to answer fundamental questions about the
              additivity
of energy and momentum in space-time.  Even so, achieving
              these
goals would only represent a small step forward in understanding
the
              implications and intricacies of General Relativity
