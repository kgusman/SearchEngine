We shall study the upper bounds for eigenvalues on surfaces.
              Let
M be a smooth compact two-dimensional surface. Assuming that the
area of
              M is equal to 1, one can prove that for each k,the k-th
eigenvalue of the
              Laplacian on M has an upper bound depending
only on the topology of M;
              however, the sharp upper bounds for
the egenvalues are known for only a few
              surfaces.  We plan to
confirm Rauch's ``Hot Spot'' conjecture on the location
              of the
supremum of the second Neumann eigenfunction on a convex plain
domain.
               We shall study the Liouville type properties for
complete minimal surfaces.
              Recently the author proved the
existence of a complete and bounded minimal
              surface. This result
settled in the negative the problem of Calabi and Yau. We
              expect
that mild additional assumptions will give us the nonexistence
result
              for complete bounded minimal surfaces.

Elliptic second order equations are
              at the heart of different
fields of mathematics and especially in the problems
              of applied
mathematics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, etc. For applications
one
              mostly needs information about the geometry of the solution
of the elliptic
              equations, locations of their critical points,
dependence of the spectrum on
              the shape of the domains, etc. We
are planning the study of the geometry of
              solutions and
eigenfunctions of elliptic equations. In particular we study
              the
problem of the location of the hottest point in an isolated body
in the
              absence of inner sources of heat. It is expected that
whatever the initial
              distribution of the temperature the hottest
point after a certain period of
              time will reach the boundary of
the body. This is a long-standing conjecture,
              so far proved for
the bodies of the simplest shape like balls, cubes etc. We
              are
planning to settle the "hot spot conjecture" for a wide class
              of
domains.
