This project concerns two major themes.  The first, joint work
with
              Bruce Kleiner, considers infinite groups G acting
cocompactly on nonpositively
              curved spaces H (in the sense of
Alexandrov), and treats the relationship
              between the geometry of
H and the induced action of G on the ideal boundary of
              H.  This
can be considered an aspect of geometric group theory and
              is
partially motivated by some questions of Gromov. The other
              theme,
involving Kleiner and Sharafutdinov as coauthors (on
              different
aspects), is the study of rigidity theorems (i.e.
              metric
uniqueness) on compact manifolds.  Here for example we
              consider
isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the
              same
spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or
lengths
              of closed geodesics) be isometric.  This also includes
questions about metric
              rigidity induced by conjugacy of geodesic
flows, as well as inverse scattering
              problems.

The second theme of the project concerns the question of
              whether
a space can be determined by a certain set of data.  One part of
this
              relates to questions of remote sensing.  For example: can
you determine the
              density of an object (say a persons body or the
moon) from measurements taken
              "from the outside"?  The CAT scan
is a practical example where one determines
              the mass density of
an object from measurements of the total mass along
              straight
lines.  An alternative set of measurements is the set of times
              it
takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary
(this is
              a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt
with in the proposal). 
              The thrust of the proposed study is to
determine under which circumstances
              certain sets of data
(e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of closed geodesics, distances
              between
boundary points) are sufficient to completely determine the
geometry
              of the spaces in question.  Groups show up naturally as
symmetries of various
              spaces.  The first theme of this project
concerns a class of infinite groups
              which are symmetries of
Hadamard spaces H (which include spaces of
              nonpositive
curvature.)  As such they induce symmetries on a
              natural
boundary, B, of H.  Bruce Kleiner and the PI have found an
unexpected
              relationship between the action of the group on B and
the geometry of H.  It
              had been suspected that in this setting
that the action on B would be
              determined only by the nature of
the group (as is the case in the related
              setting of hyperbolic
groups acting on negatively curved spaces).  This study
              intends
to determine the precise nature of this relationship and use it
to
              study properties of the group and space.
