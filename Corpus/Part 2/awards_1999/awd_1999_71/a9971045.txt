The
              PI proposes to investigate the relationship between geometric
and topological
              invariants of Riemannian manifolds. The study can
be divided up into at least
              two parts. There are general
finiteness results where one simply obtains some
              bounds on
topological invariants from certain bounds on the geometry. The
PI
              proposes to work on several finiteness phenomena for manifolds
with integral
              bounds for the curvature. The isospectral
compactness problem for 3-manifolds
              will also be
investigated. There are more specific situations where one
              can
compute very specific topological invariants from certain
specific
              geometric information. Under this heading one also
studies various pinching
              phenomena, where the goal is to
understand the specific topological type of a
              Riemannian manifold
with restrictions on some of its geometric invariants. The
              PI
proposes to study Gauss-Bonnet type theorems for noncompact
4-manifolds
              and their relationship with the study of Euclidean
quantum gravity. This is
              well studied in the setting of compact
manifolds, but much less understood for
              noncompact manifolds. It
is also proposed to investigate various pinching
              phenomena both
for curvature and eigenvalues. Finally the PI will undertake
              a
study of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere and try to determine whether it
admits
              metrics with positive sectional curvature.

The main goal of the PI's
              research centers on understanding the
relationship between on one hand
              geometric quantities such as
size, volume and bending and on the other hand
              the complexity of
the objects. Complexity is often measured by how many holes
              the
object has, a jungle gym is more complex than a doughnut which in
turn is
              more complex than a ball.  Depending on how good ones
geometric information is
              one can obtain very general bounds on
the complexity, but it is also possible
              to sometimes completely
determine what the object is. For instance, only a
              ball has the
property that it bends in the same manner everywhere. There
              are
also very interesting relationships between the geometric
quantities
              themselves. For instance, any object that bends in the
same direction
              everywhere is bounded in size and volume. Such
results also have counterparts
              in Einstein's theory of general
relativity. There such results are related to
              the study of the
Big Bang, black holes, and the ultimate fate on the universe.
              One
technical item the PI studies is the possibility that ones
measurement of
              bending does not have to be very precise. In other
words, slightly vision
              impaired people's ideas of bending are as
good as those of people with perfect
              eye sight.
