In Geometric Invariant Theory, in order to study the
              moduli
problems, the notion of stability for any polarized projective
variety
              is introduced. However to check the stability is usually
a difficult problem. 
              It has been done by Mumford for curves with
genus bigger than 1, by Gieseker
              for surfaces of general type,
and by Viehweg for high dimensional varieties
              with semi-ample
canonical line bundles. We will study the stability of
              a
polarized smooth projective variety as used by Gieseker and
Mumford from a
              differential geometric viewpoint. More
specifically, we try to relate the
              Gieseker-Mumford stability to
the existence of a special Kahler metric on the
              variety such that
its scalar curvature is constant and its Ricci
              curvature
satisfies some non-degenerate constraints. This metric is
              not
Kahler-Einstein, but is closely related to Kahler-Einstein
metric. One
              motivation for this project comes from the previous
work done by Donaldson,
              Uhlenbeck and Yau on the relation between
stability of vector bundle and the
              existence of Yang-Mills
connection.
 
Our project is to relate two important
              but different fields in
mathematics together. One is the study of special
              metrics, which
involves the study of differential equations on manifold
              and
usually has connection to physics.  Another is the study of
stability in
              moduli space theory which involves mainly
algebra. Our approach is to
              establish a correspondence between
these two fields, in particular to describe
              the meaning of
stability in terms of the existence of special metrics.
              The
advantage for doing is it will not only provide us with new
insights
              about those special metrics, but also provide us with
new technique to moduli
              space theory. For example, this kind of
correspondence will enable us to solve
              some difficult
mathematical questions such as checking the
              Gieseker-Mumford
stability of some manifolds. This question is one of
              the
fundamental questions in the moduli space theory but has not been
solved
              in general.
