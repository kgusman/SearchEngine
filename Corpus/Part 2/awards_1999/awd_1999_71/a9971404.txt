     The goal of this project is to understand
              3-dimensional 
Poincare duality groups and pairs, subgroups of mapping class
              groups
and automorphisms of free groups, complex-hyperbolic
              surfaces,
polygons in symmetric spaces, line arrangements, Artin groups,
              and
dimension functions on groups.
     The project focuses in part on the
              structure of symmetries of
objects naturally arising in geometry and algebra. 
              The ancient Greeks
understood symmetries of Platonic solids, e.g., a cube or
              a
dodecahedron.  Platonic solids are positively curved, and they have
              a
finite number of symmetries.  At the opposite end of the spectrum
              are
negatively curved objects, such as the Lobachevsky hyperbolic
              plane
(featured frequently in Escher paintings), and these typically
              have
infinitely many symmetries.  Consequently, the structure of
              these
symmetries is both more interesting and harder to understand. 
              The
symmetries of an object form a ``group.''  One way to measure
              the
``size'' of a group, even when the group is infinite, is to talk
              about
its ``dimension.''  For example, the dimension of the group
              of
symmetries of the hyperbolic plane, depicted in the Escher
              drawing
mentioned above, is two, reflecting the nature of the plane. 
              In
general, the concept of dimension depends on the background choice
              of
numbering system (coefficient ring).  The project will study
              this
dependence.  Yet another part of the project is the study of
              polygons.
These seemingly simple objects in the Euclidean plane and space
              become
increasingly more complex as one considers more complicated spaces. 
              One
of the new phenomena is that an edge of a polygon may be determined
              not
just by its length but also by its ``direction.''  In the case
              of
ordinary space, if one fixes the origin of an edge, one can rotate
              the
second end to attain an arbitrary direction.  A Euclidean triangle
              is
determined by its three side-lengths.  To construct such a triangle it
is
              enough to satisfy three ``triangle inequalities.''  These properties
no longer
              hold in more general spaces, which makes study of polygons
there much more
              interesting and complicated.
