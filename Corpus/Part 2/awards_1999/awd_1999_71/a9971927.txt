This
              research proposal deals with applications of analytic
methods of minimal
              surface theory to geometric and topological
problems.  More precisely, in the
              first part of the proposal,
motivated by the prominent role of the second
              variation theory
for geodesics in classical Riemannian geometry together
              with
modern minimal surface techniques, the investigator proposes
methods for
              understanding the second variation theory for the
free boundary problem for
              minimal disks together with its
geometric implications. In the second part,
              the investigator
proposes projects applying minimal surface theory to study
              the
topological structure of manifolds with positive
              isotropic
curvature.

This proposal deals with certain two dimensional
              variational
problems which arise from a geometric setting. For example,
              the
first part deals with the problem of extremizing the area for
mappings
              from the disk into a manifold subject to a boundary
constraint. In case the
              manifold is the three dimensional
Euclidean space, we are constructing
              mathematical ``soap films''
meeting a constraint surface orthogonally. Free
              boundary problems
arise naturally in material science, for example in
              fluid
interface problems, and in elasticity problems. Objects which
              are
critical points for a geometric variational problem can
frequently be
              shown to satisfy very special properties. The basic
goal is to use such
              information to derive properties of the
general geometric class under
              consideration.  The results of this
project are aimed at advancing our
              understanding of fundamental
relationships between the curvature and topology
              of manifolds
