The
              principal investigator plans to continue his work on various
ways in which Lie
              groups arise in geometry. Special emphasis will
be put on geometry and
              topology of cohomogeneity one manifolds,
i.e. manifolds on which a Lie group
              acts with one dimensional
quotient. One goal will be to show that every
              cohomogeneity one
manifold has a metric with non-negative sectional
              curvature,
which would imply that many exotic spheres admit a metric
              with
non-negative sectional curvature.  The second goal will be to
classify
              cohomogeneity one manifolds with positive sectional
curvature, with the hope
              of finding some new examples of compact
manifolds with positive sectional
              curvature. For non-compact
manifolds, we will examine the converse to the
              Cheeger Gromoll
soul theorem, which asks which vector bundles over
              compact
non-negatively curved manifolds admit complete metrics
              with
non-negative curvature. This can be done by examining
cohomogeneity one
              action on the principal bundle of the vector
bundle.  Further studies include
              the classification of primitive
subgroups of finite dimensional Lie groups and
              global variational
properties of the scalar curvature functional on
              homogeneous
spaces.

A subject of major interest in Riemannian geometry over
              the last
30 years has been the geometry of exotic spheres, which
              are
manifolds that look like spheres but on which ordinary calculus
is quite
              different. These objects were discovered 40 years ago by
Milnor and ever since
              then geometers were interested in finding a
geometric description of them
              where the natural local invariants
look like spheres, i.e. where the curvature
              is positive or
non-negative. In our project we have found many new examples
              of
exotic spheres where the curvature is non-negative and have
further plans
              for finding more such examples. A natural question
is if one can deform these
              to metrics with positive curvature,
one of the most intriguing open problems
              in global Riemannian
geometry.  Our major technique is to examining
              symmetry
properties of such objects and related manifolds. A large group
of
              symmetries usually implies interesting geometric and
topological properties
              and has always been a key ingredient in
many mathematical subjects. We were
              able to construct many new
manifolds with non-negative curvature and such
              large symmetry
groups, which has a number of interesting applications, both
              in
geometry and topology.
