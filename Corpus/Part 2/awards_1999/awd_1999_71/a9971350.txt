Title: "Invariants of knots and
              3-manifolds, their properties and topology"

Abstract: This research studies 
              quantum and finite type  invariants of
3-manifolds and their relationships
              with classical topological and
geometrical invariants. The investigator will
              continue to study
the universal finite type invariant of homology 3-spheres
              which he
developed in joint work with J. Murakami and T. Ohtsuki.
              In
particular, he plans to develop the theory further to include
other
              3-manifolds and to study the topological quantum field
theory associated with
              the Le-Murakmi-Ohtsuki invariant which is
different from those associated with
              usual quantum invariants.  He
will try to understand the topology of these new
              invariants and
find their applications. One of the projects is to study
              relations
between the hyperbolic, or more general, simplicial, volume
              of
knots and their quantum invariants (to prove the
Kashaev-Murakami-Murakami
              conjecture).

The theory of knots and 3-manifolds is an old branch
              of
mathematics which has gained renewed interest among mathematicians
and
              physicists after the discovery of the Jones polynomial and its
relation to
              theoretical physics (quantum field theory, high energy
physics). In fact,  it
              is now one of the most active domains in
mathematics. Many results of knot
              theory may also find
applications in molecular biology. To classify knots
              and
3-manifolds, mathematicians use "invariants". This research
project
              studies new classes of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds
and their
              relationships with the classical ones. The new
invariants are very powerful in
              distinguishing knots and
3-manifolds.
