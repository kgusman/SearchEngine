The
              proposal is concerned with three separate problems in
algebraic geometry,
              differential geometry and in partial
differential equations.The first problem
              is concerned with a
complex variables analog of the classical theorem of E.
              Artin,
which states that a non-negative polynomial in n real variables
can be
              written as a sum of squares of rational functions. The
proposal seeds to
              determine exactly when a given nonnegative
polynomial in n complex variables
              can be written as a quotient of
two functions, each of which is the sum of
              squares of holomorphic
polynomials.  A conjecture is stated, which as a
              special case
would likely lead to a constructive version of Artin's
              theorem.
The second problem is concerned with the Kuranishi problem,
              which
seeks geometric conditions involving the Levi form that imply
that a
              given local neighborhood of a CR manifold can be embedded
into complex
              Euclidean space. The proposal describes a possible
approach to the problem of
              finding such an embedding when the
associated CR structure is minimally
              smooth.  The third problem
is concerned with finding sufficient conditions for
              either
compactness or hypoellipticity of the complex Neumann problem in
the
              case when the boundary of the domain is of infinite type.

It is well-known
              fact that not all results in mathematics can be
immediately applied to
              so-called real world problems. Sometimes
the proof of an important statement
              depends on abstract methods
which cannot be easily applied in more concrete
              situations which
call for an explicit construction. For the first problem,
              the
proposer is examining a well-known theorem in algebra which uses
abstract
              methods to explain why certain polynomials are always
nonnegative. In order
              for this theorem to be used in the real
world, it would be very important to
              find a constructive proof of
this theorem.  The second part of the proposal
              has to do with a
problem in geometry in which a a surface in effect is not
              smooth
and has sharp corners or twists built into it.  Such problems are
also
              important for applications because in problems having to do
with the shapes of
              objects, it is rarely the case that the
objects are completely smooth. 
              Although the problem that is
studied is somewhat theoretical, it often happens
              that techniques
developed in one problem can often be used in related areas
              as
well.
