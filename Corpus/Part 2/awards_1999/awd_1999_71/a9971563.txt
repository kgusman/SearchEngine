              Abstract



Award:  DMS-9971563

Principal Investigator:  Michael
              Wolf



Michael Wolf proposes to continue his studies of the
              applications

of Teichmuller theory to the theory of complete minimal
              surfaces

in space and of the applications of new techniques in
              harmonic

maps to singular spaces to problems in Teichmuller
              theory,

discrete groups and (smooth) harmonic maps theory. 
              In

particular, he proposes to extend his present methods for
              finding

complete minimal surfaces to periodic minimal surfaces,
              then

proving their embeddedness via a combination
              of

Teichmuller-theoretic and minimal surface methods, and then

finally
              studying limits of families of these surfaces as their

genus increases. He
              also proposes to classify the minimal maps of

surfaces into a particular
              building associated to convex

projective structures on Riemann surfaces (in
              order to identify a

geometrically natural compactification of the space of
              discrete

faithful representations of a surface group into the Lie group
              of

convex projective transformations).  Finally, he proposes to
              use

harmonic maps to singular spaces (both with mild singularities

and
              more serious singularities, like real trees) to study bending

measure
              coordinates on the Bers slice of Quasifuchsian space, and

harmonic maps
              between hyperbolic spaces.



The fundamental questions underlying all of
              this are, "What are

the possible shapes of surfaces we might encounter?",
              and "What

shapes arise if we require the surfaces to be efficient users
              of

material, in some sense?"  There are, of course, many ways
              of

interpreting the words "shape" and "efficient", and
              different

applications of the proposed research would most likely
              involve

different interpretations of those words. This research
              project

is an attempt to advance our understanding of the
              possibilities

for the shapes of soap films (which efficiently use material
              --

some applications of this theory by others to material science is

in
              its embryonic stage) and for three other types of shapes. We

also study the
              possible ways of transforming one surface into

another in an energetically
              efficient way. It turns out that all

these different problems are deeply
              interrelated, so advances in

one area often lead to advances in
              others.
