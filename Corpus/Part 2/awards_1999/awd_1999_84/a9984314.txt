Abstract    :
              This research focuses on data-intensive computing---embedding processing
              capability in the memory and I/O subsystems of traditional computer systems and
              shipping the code to the data rather than moving the data through the main
              microprocessor.  Novel architectures that can exploit this newfound flexibility
              in the memory and I/O system have the potential to significantly improve
              performance and robustness. They will also remove three important limitations
              in current parallel and uniprocessor architectures: hardwired cache coherence
              protocols in scalable multiprocessors, poor cache performance for applications
              with bad stride accesses or poor spatial locality, and latency and bandwidth
              bottlenecks in I/O-intensive applications.  This research specifically
              addresses those limitations and includes the development of novel coherence
              protocols and fairness mechanisms for programmable memory systems; and the
              development of the necessary protocol extensions to convert the FLASH
              multiprocessor into an active memory machine. This will be done by exploiting
              the existence of a hardware prototype to run real-world problems and gain
              insight into the potential of flexible memory and I/O systems. Finally, the
              design of Active Fabric, a high performance novel unified architecture for
              data-intensive computing will be accomplished.
