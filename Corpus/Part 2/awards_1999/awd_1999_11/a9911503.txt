Abstract    :
              In this proposed multi-level and longitudinal household data from a large
              national probability sample of over 4500 rural households in India covering the
              period 1968-1982 and new data covering the period through 1999, merged with
              supplementary area-specific data from governmental sources and from satellites,
              will be used to reexamine comprehensively the effects of economic growth on the
              distribution of incomes across households and individuals, on economic mobility
              and on the formation and dissolution of households. A unique and critical
              feature of the merged data is that they document a period of time in India
              which conforms closely to a natural experiment in which the source of economic
              development - the "green revolution" - was exogenous to the population, was
              measurable, and, due to natural conditions, was geographically selective. It is
              thus possible to document how economic development, propelled by agricultural
              productivity growth, differentially affected human capital returns and
              investments and other household behavior.

The underlying theme of this work
              is that the evaluation of economic change on individual welfare must
              importantly account for how individuals are grouped into households and how
              household interact through transfers, markets, and local political
              institutions. The particular aims of the project include (a) the achievement of
              a better understanding of household behavior and intra-household distribution,
              (b) an assessment of the contributions of interhousehold transfers to income
              security and investment in a dynamic context, (c) estimation of the
              determinants of household break-up and formation, with particular focus on the
              impact of technical change, (d) an evaluation of the role of dowry in affecting
              investments in gender-specific human capital and the distribution of resources
              across households, and (e) the evaluation of the role of local governments in
              allocating land resources and other public goods with attention to both
              distributive and efficiency criteria and with particular attention to forest
              resources situated on common lands.

These new inquiries will be based on the
              availability of a new survey round of the panel data used in the prior project
              work. The new data not only expand the time frame for analysis another 17
              years, for a total span of temporal coverage of more than 30 years, but provide
              new information particularly suited to analyses of households in a dynamic
              context. In particular, the new data provide information more consistent with
              new frameworks describing family and household relations and will include
              split-off households in the panel for the first time as well as retrospective
              information on the marriages of all family members and household division
              histories. These novel and unique household data will in particular permit a
              detailed exploration of family and household relations and how these and the
              outcomes of family decisions are affected over the long as well as the
              short-run by economic change. The new data will also provide retrospective data
              on the governance structures of the villages, enabling the construction of a
              village-level data set of approximately 250 villages over 30 years with which
              to explore whether and how village governance affects the distribution of
              resources across households, common land use and the exploitation of forest
              resources. The availability of these unique data spanning a long time-period
              yet providing detail at the individual, household level and family level will
              thus provide an improved empirical basis for assessing theories of the
              distributional effects of growth and development as well as of household
              behavior.
