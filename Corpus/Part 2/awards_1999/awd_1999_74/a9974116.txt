     The overall technical objective of the project is to
              develop
three-dimensional topographical models that describe seabed
dynamics
              in wave-dominated near-shore zones and shelf regions
where single and multiple
              sand bars or sand ridges form a central
morphological feature.  The
              investigator models and analyses the
effects of waves and currents on coastal
              dynamics.  This is
challenging because of the presence of two free surfaces,
              the
water surface and the movable bottom, both of which change over
time, and
              which interact with each other through complex,
nonlinear processes.  The
              model features nonlinear, dispersive,
dissipative partial differential
              equations to describe the
evolution of waves coming in to the shore from deep
              water.  These
equations, which are of Boussinesq type, are coupled to a
              model
for run-up and reflection at the shoreline.  Once the evolution of
the
              water surface is approximately known, the velocity field in
the bulk of the
              fluid may then be determined via potential
theory.  This velocity field is
              then viewed as driving a viscous,
sediment-laden boundary layer in which the
              sediment transport is
taking place.  The velocity distribution in this layer
              is
determined using ideas similar to those pioneered by
Longuet-Higgins.  By
              applying conservation of sediment mass in an
infinitesimal form, a
              differential equation is thereby inferred
that serves to determine the bottom
              deformation.  Thus the entire
model is somewhat complicated, consisting of a
              nonlinear
initial-boundary-value problem for the wave motion coupled in
              a
nonlocal way to a conservation law for the bottom movement.  This
model is
              developed in detail, analysed and implemented as a
computer code.  Model
              predictions are compared with field data.
It is also proposed to link the
              computer code with input from a
Geographical Information System, to allow
              easier deployment of
the model in real situations.
     The underlying
              motivation for the project is two-fold.
First, there is a desire to understand
              both qualitatively and
quantitatively some of the fundamental processes that
              lead to the
formation and maintenance of bottom structure in coastal
              zones
and on continental shelves.  This involves a thorough knowledge
of both
              the wave environment and the dynamics of the bed as it is
influenced by waves
              and by currents.  Second, and not less
important, the project responds to the
              need for new and more
sophisticated tools to aid in the development of
              strategies to
deal with real coastal engineering problems.  The project has
              the
potential to contribute to the study of a number of important
scientific
              and environmental issues.  The ocean margins in North
America are vast and in
              many places, troubled.  Indeed, erosion
of unconsolidated coastlines is a
              world-wide phenomenon that is
not well understood.  Global warming will
              aggravate these
problems by increasing sea levels, thus causing shore retreat
              and
providing a better base for the scour and erosion associated with
wave
              activity.  Fragile Arctic coasts and low-altitude regions
are already
              displaying unmistakable signs of deterioration caused
by these global changes.
               Severe erosion may well spread to other
coast regions within the next half
              century, and thus there will
be an increased interest in effective prevention
              methods.  In
addition to "hard" protection schemes such as the construction
              of
seawalls and the like, there will be an increased demand for
"soft"
              protection strategies that take advantage of natural
processes.
