Successful L2-methods arise to address a wide variety of
              problems
in a number of contexts (for example, mathematical
              physics,
geometry, and topology).  As this is the case, the
              methods
themselves are often strikingly different.  Nonetheless, it is
often
              the case that these different methods can be used to
provide insight directed
              towards the same or similar problems.
The primary purpose of the workshop
              ``L2-methods in Geometry'' is
to bring together leading figures in geometric
              analysis who have
developed different L2-methods for investigating
              related
geometric phenomena.  Topics which will be addressed at the
workshop
              will include: index theorems, traces and determinants of
pseudodifferential
              operators and their applications, spectral
invariants including analytic
              torsion and Novikov-Shubin
invariants, and Von Neumann algebra methods in
              (spectral)
geometry. The workshop will provide the young investigators with
a
              unique opportunity to interact with distinguished senior
colleagues who have
              developed a variety of approaches to
geometric problems and who will focus
              their collective attention
on a sharply defined collection of
              problems.

Analytic methods have contributed immensely to our
              collective
understanding of many mathematical disciplines, as well as to
              our
understanding of a number of fundamental topics in physics, some
of which
              have found their way into important applications (for
example, various imaging
              techniques).  This workshop will bring
together a distinguished international
              collection of scholars who
have made fundamental contributions to the field of
              geometric
analysis.  These contributions reflect a diverse collection
              of
perspectives offerred as explanations for the same or similar
phenomena. 
              Bringing these perspectives together will foster an
exchange of ideas and
              collaboration on problems of deep interest
to the mathematics community at
              large.  Such an environment will
provide many young investigators with a
              valuable oppportunity to
compare and contrast a variety of ideas and
              approaches, shaping
the direction in which they will move.
