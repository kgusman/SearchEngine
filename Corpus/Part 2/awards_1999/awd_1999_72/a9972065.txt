The
              project is dedicated to the study of relation between
representation theory
              and the theory of D-modules.  The first
part concerns a generalization of
              Bernstein-Beilinson result for
Harish-Chandra modules.  It was shown by
              Fernando that if M is an
irreducible module over finite-dimensional Lie
              algebra G then the
set of elements which act locally finitely on M is a
              Lie
subalgebra.  If the corresponding Lie subgroup K has finitely
many orbits
              on the flag manifold then Bernstein and Beilinson
showed that such modules can
              be obtained as D-modules extended
from K-orbits on the flag manifold.  The
              principal investigator
hopes to relate a subgroup K and algebraic properties
              of M with
geometric properties of the corresponding D-modules.  As a
              first
result she has a geometric construction of (G,K)-module for every
K
              containing the maximal torus.  The second problem to be
attacked is a
              generalization of Bernstein- Beilinson theorem for
Lie superalgebras.  A
              straightforward generalization works only
for non-degenerate central
              character, while the most interesting
representation theory happens in
              degenerate case.  The principal
investigator hopes to use a superanalogue of
              Bernstein-Beilinson
theorem to prove her earlier conjecture for
              Kazhdan-Lusztig
polynomials in the super case.

The symmetries of geometric
              objects and physical theories form
Lie groups, whose local and infinitesimal
              structure are described
by Lie algebras: vector spaces with a product
              operation
satisfying simple rules.  Representation theory concerns
              basic
decompositions and manifestations of these Lie algebras and
groups in
              geometry, analysis, and algebra.  The D-modules of the
project title are
              algebraic structures which capture essential
aspects of calculus and analysis.
               The principal investigator
believes that geometric aspects of representation
              theory founded
in works of Brylinski, Beilinson, Bernstein, Kashiwara,
              Kazhdan,
Lusztig and others can be applied to pure algebraic
representation
              theory, especially in the theory of weight modules
developed by Fernando,
              Futorny and in recent work of Mathieu.
One hopes that technical algebraic
              details of their proofs can
become clear when done in geometric language of
              D-modules.
