Abstract    :
                After 1910 or so, the attention of most  philosophers and physicists shifted
              from the foundational uncertainties of the classical physics of continua-that
              is, continuously extended, flexible objects such as wires, plates, or fluids-to
              the novel puzzles raised by quantum mechanics and relativity.  For various
              extraneous reasons, twentieth-century physicists began to see the special
              subject of point masses as comprising all of `classical mechanics,` although
              this anti-continuum view would not have been shared by most of their
              nineteenth-century forebears.  Compared to continua, point masses present
              relatively few conceptual problems, and the modern shift in the meaning of
              `classical mechanics` has led many contemporary philosophers and historians to
              misunderstand the conceptual problems with which the nineteenth century
              struggled.  At the same time, there has been much ongoing work on the behavior
              of classical extended bodies in this century, conducted largely by engineers
              and applied mathematicians.  These investigations have taught us much about the
              structure and range of validity of classical ways of thinking that were
              completely unknown in the nineteenth century.  Unfortunately, although
              philosophers of science continually cite `the lessons to be learned from
              classical theory,` most philosophers have not kept current with new knowledge
              on the topic.  The purpose of this project is to reexamine, in the light of
              twentieth-century research on mechanics, a number of central historical
              episodes that continue to play pivotal roles in philosophical argumentation
              today, including the reasons why so many classical physicists believed that
              science needs to be inherently `idealized` or otherwise `anti-realistic` in its
              procedures; Duhem's motives in articulating the famed Quine-Duhem thesis; the
              considerations that motivated his rejection of atomistic modeling; whether it
              is reasonable to expect that a single set of axioms can adequately cover all of
              what we usually regard as `classical mechanics.`
