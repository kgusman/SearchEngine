Abstract    :
              9733237  Tsai    Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is central to the
              initiation and maintenance of reproduction in vertebrates.  It stimulates the
              release of two hormones from the pituitary that directly regulate the growth of
              ovaries and testes and the production of sex steroid hormones, such as estrogen
              and testosterone.  Defects in GnRH production and/or release will invariably
              lead to sterility.  Despite this hormone's importance in the reproduction of
              vertebrates, very little is known about when GnRH originally arose in evolution
              and when it began to assume the role of a central reproductive regulator.  Dr.
              Tsai has shown that GnRH-like molecules exist in a protostome, Aplysia
              californica.  The evolutionary implication of these results is extremely
              exciting since it suggest that GnRH may have already been present in a
              primitive invertebrate ancestor that gave rise to diverse group of vertebrates
              and invertebrates.  Such extraordinary conservation over the course of
              evolution opens up the door to many possibilities regarding the functional
              roles that GnRH had assumed over the course of evolution.  Dr. Tsai will
              integrative molecular, physiological and evolutionary approaches to examine
              structural and functional conservation of GnRH.  As part of this CAREER award,
              she will use the same multidisciplinary approach to design a new laboratory
              course on comparative reproductive biology.  Moreover, Dr. Tsai will actively
              recruit students interested in addressing evolutionary questions with molecular
              techniques from regional campuses to initiate research projects.  The
              information gained from her research program will have profound implications
              concerning how the system of reproductive regulation presently seen in humans
              and other vertebrates has evolved over many millions of years.
