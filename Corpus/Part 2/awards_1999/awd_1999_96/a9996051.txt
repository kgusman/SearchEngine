Abstract    :
              9625431  Wible   Since the famous fossil-collecting expeditions to the Gobi
              Desert of Mongolia in the 1920s, scientists at the American Museum of Natural
              History and their colleagues have continued an outstanding tradition of
              research on Cretaceous-age dinosaurs, birds, and mammals. Fossil collections
              resumed recently with Mongolian and Chinese collaborators, and these new
              expeditions are yielding abundant specimens of both known and entirely new
              groups (taxa) of dinosaurs and early dinosaur-like mammals. Material includes
              exquisitely preserved skulls and skeletons of multituberculates and taxa
              considered to belong to basal groups of placental mammals. Study of this
              material will provide new evidence bearing on taxonomic diversity and
              phylogenetic (evolutionary) relationships of early mammal-like reptiles and of
              the early lineages of true mammals. New characters from dentition, skull, and
              postcranial skeletons will be amassed using traditional paleontological
              techniques as well as new CT (computer-aided tomography) scanning of specimens,
              which avoids destructive sampling.    AMNH scientists in association with
              colleagues at University of Louisville and abroad are working to integrate the
              new knowledge of taxa and of characters from these early fossil mammals with
              knowledge from known fossil and extant groups, and in turn to compare their
              results with data from molecular (DNA) studies of living taxa. In particular,
              well-documented fossil species will provide calibration points for theoretical
              studies of molecular evolutionary rates. And the eventual integration of
              morphological and molecular evidence should provide robust estimates of
              evolutionary history for the early lineages of mammals and their close
              relatives.
