              Jin   Title: Numerical Methods for Hyperbolic Systems and Related Problems     
              I propose to study and design numerical methods for hyperbolic  systems of
              conservation laws and related problems.  The underlying  physical problems
              arise from fluid dynamics, rarefied gas dynamics and  wave propagation.  I plan
              to work on three main projects:  1. the development of robust shock capturing
              methods for hyperbolic  systems with relaxations, including  kinetic equations;
               2. the construction and study of relaxation approximations and  relaxation
              schemes for viscous systems of conservations laws and  Hamilton-Jacobi
              equations.  3. asymptotic and numerical study on wave propagation in random
              media.  These projects if successfully carried out will provide  attractive 
              numerical methods that are able to simulate a wide variety of  challenging
              physical and industrial problems. They also help to gain  more understanding of
              the underlying physical phenomena.      With the development of modern
              computers, scientific computation has  been playing a central role in
              scientific investigation. The physical  and industrial problems we study here
              arise in complex fluids, optics  and materials, which can not be solved by
              other scientific tools.  Nervetheless, numerical computation has been
              demonstrated to be an  effective tool to obtain very good approximations to the
              solutions of  these problems. Our goal, if met,  will advance our ability to
              utilize  modern computers to solve these problems of significant importance.
