Abstract    :
                9704222  Erskine    This award partially supports the development of unique 
              instrumentation for synthesizing laterally constrained thin film and 
              multilayer magnetic materials and microstructures and for studying  novel
              magnetic phenomena in the structures The new instrument  incorporates
              state-of-the-art thin film growth and characterization  capabilities, contact
              mask and focused ion beam technology capable of  creating submicron structures
              in the films, and complementary high  spatial resolution magnetic sensitive
              spectroscopy/microscopy probes  The new instrumentation adds important
              capabilities to existing  research programs of several faculty at The
              University of Texas which  explore thin film magnetism, mesoscopic physics,
              micromagnetics and  magneto-transport phenomena.    Scientific issues to be
              explored based on new capabilities of the  instrument include 1) micromagnetic
              phenomena including properties of  magnetic domains in ultrathin films and
              patterned micron-scale  ultrathin film structures; 2) the effects of
              deliberately induced  substrate roughness (atomic steps) and film thickness
              variations on  magnetic domains and related properties including coercive
              forces and  anisotropy of thin films and thin film based microstructures; 3) 
              finite size scaling effects, critical behavior, exchange coupling and 
              dynamical properties of well characterized multilayer and  microstructured
              magnetic systems, and 4) magneto-transport and related  magnetic phenomena
              associated with multilayer films and multilayer-  based microstructures.    An
              important feature of the instrument design is the unique  combination of
              materials growth and microstructure fabrication  capabilities, materials
              characterization tools and magnetic sensitive  probes which can be used
              separately or as an integrated system. The  instrument consists of three
              coupled subsystems 1) a thin film growth  and characterization chamber
              incorporating multicell molecular beam  epitaxy (MBE) with real-time growth
              monitoring tools inclu ding  Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction
              (RHEED) and Auger Electron  Spectroscopy (AES); Low Energy Electron Diffraction
              (LEED) including  high resolution spot profile analysis capability;  2) a
              Magneto-Optic  Kerr Effect (MOKE) polarimeter set up for high spatial
              resolution  scanning measurements as well as analysis of hysteresis dynamics;
              and  3) a high resolution Scanning Electron Microscope with Spin  Polarization
              Analysis (SEMPA) instrument. The SEM/SEMPA instrument is  configured to accept
              a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) column to mill  microstructures while viewing the
              process using SEM.  The system is  integrated with gate valves and air lock
              chambers permitting the  SEMPA/MOKE subsystem or the MOKE/film growth subsystem
              to be used  independently.  %%%  This instrumentation has the potential to
              advance the fundamental  knowledge and understanding of thin-film magnetic
              structure.  Such  structures have great potential for device applications,
              which can  produce breakthroughs in magnetic device technology.
