Abstract    :
              9704972  Joynt  This grant will support the work of this mid-career theorist  in
              three different projects in the general area of strongly  correlated electrons.
               Continuing the PI's work on  supercondictivity of heavy fermions, the first
              project  contains a study of the expected effects in neutron  scattering from a
              flux lattice.  In the second project based  on the properties high Tc
              superconductors, there are two sub-  projects:  (1) Properties of a twin
              boundary junction and a  proximity effect junction and (2) a variational study
              of  disorder on a "d-wave"superconductor.  Finally, there are  plans to study
              the properties of a liquid crystal like state  in quantum Hall effect.  %%% 
              This grant to mid-career theorist supports work in several  projects related to
              the properties of some curious  superconductors, all discovered during the
              Eighties.  They  include alloys of Uranium and Platinum, where the PI 
              pioneered with some early work on the unconventional  superconducting
              properties.  They also include the better  known high Tc materials where again
              the PI made some early  conjectures about some special effects and which
              survive a  closer scrutiny in more recent years.  Much of the work  proposed
              here builds on this very creative and original PI's  earlier successes.  ***
