Abstract    :
              A computational strategy will be used to carry out the first completely
              quantized first-principles quantum dynamical simulations of condensed matter
              systems, in which both the electronic and nuclear quantization are effectively
              included.  The computational strategy combines the Centroid Molecular Dynamics
              (CMD) approach and the Car-Parrinello  (CP) method within a scalable algorithm.
               The quantum dynamical information will be obtained by running classical-style
              CMD trajectories for the quantum particles on an effective,
              temperature-dependent ab initio potential. The ab initio effective potential
              will be calculated by performing equilibrium Car-Parrinello quantum
              path-integral averaging simultaneously with the time-integration of the MD
              equations. This methodology will be implemented in a parallel CMD algorithm,
              which should be capable of near linear performance scaling.  A key element in
              the simulation methodology will be the implementation of a cumulant averaging
              strategy to significantly reduce the computational workload.  The success of
              the project will rely on the development of intrisically scalable computational
              methods implemented on highly parallel computing platforms.
