Abstract    :
              Gofron  9704194    This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency 
              of Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Kazimierz  Gofron at the Japan
              Atomic Energy Research Institute  (JAERI), Kamigori, Japan.  Dr. Gofron will
              work with Dr.  Jun'ichiro Mizuki, Lead Scientist at the Spring-8 Facility,  on
              a research project entitled, "Novel Element-Specific  Studies of Magnetic
              Materials."    The proposed research will use a magnetic circular x-ray 
              dichroism technique (MCXD)  in conjunction with photoemission and conventional
              magnetic  probe to study the element specific magnetism of magneto-  optic
              materials.  The novel, high-resolution magnetic study  will focus on both the
              empty and occupied electronic states.  Attention will also be paid to orbital
              specificity.  In  these synchrotron radiation experiments the polarized x-ray 
              photons will be used as an element sensitive magnetic probe  for precisely
              monitoring the electronic structure of  specific atomic species in
              magneto-optic material.  As  magneto-optic materials are currently used in data
              storage,  of particular interest are materials with a large Kerr  effect, the
              rotation of the plane of polarization of  incident linearly polarized light. 
              One of the foremost  goals of the research is to better understand how
              individual  chemical species contributes to magnetism and magneto-optic 
              response, as well as obtain insight as to how each orbital  of a given atomic
              species contributes to the magneto-optic  response.  ***
