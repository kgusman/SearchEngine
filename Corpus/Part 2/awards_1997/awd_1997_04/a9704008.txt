Abstract    :
              ***  9704008  Abramson   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 11
              project involves the design and construction of a packet radio network based
              upon a broadband connection free protocol for integration of transaction, file
              and digital voice in a common channel. Multiple access protocols are used to
              permit independent transmitters to share a common communication channel.  When
              the number of transmitters is large and the network is required to support a
              variety of different kinds of traffic a connection free multiple access
              protocol is often required.  Spread ALOHA Multiple Access (SAMA) is such a
              protocol, combining the proven simplicity and operational flexibility of an
              ALOHA multiple access channel with the high bandwidth and high throughput of a
              spread spectrum channel.  In this Phase 11 project we plan to modify an
              existing SAMA packet radio network to implement a new efficient protocol for
              the seamless integration of a wide variety of traffic types in a common channel
                This new wideband version of SAMA will have commercial applications in PCS
              networks which must integrate data into a voice oriented architecture and in
              VSAT networks which must integrate voice into a data oriented architecture.
