Abstract    :
              9704515  Pollack    This project lies in the area of Riemannian geometry. More
              specifically, the investigator will examine complete conformally flat metrics
              of constant positive scalar curvature on manifolds of dimension greater than
              two; he will also construct complete surfaces of constant mean curvature
              surfaces embedded in Euclidean space (CMC surfaces).    Physicists often seek
              to describe the universe as a Riemannian manifold possessing a certain special
              type of geometry. The condition of constant positive scalar curvature is an
              example of such geometry. A conformally flat structure on a manifold is a
              generalization to higher dimensions of the structure on a surface in which
              angles are prescribed. Examples of CMC surfaces include soap bubbles. These are
              surfaces which try to minimize their surface area while keeping a fixed volume
              of air enclosed.
