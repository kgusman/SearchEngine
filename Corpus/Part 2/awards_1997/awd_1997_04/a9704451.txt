Abstract    :
              ***  9704451  The  increasing  importance of an annual meeting  of  researchers 
              funded by the Interactive Systems Program of the National Science  Foundation 
              is  underscored  by  a  national  agenda  that  views  improved   interfaces  
              as  vital  to  our   Nation's    economic  competitiveness, that proposes 
              universal access to  the  NII  by  every  citizen,  and  that  hopes to  place 
              computers  in  every  classroom  with network access.  Attendees of the First 
              Grantees  Workshop   (in   November  1995)  reported   uniformly   positive 
              experiences.   Researchers were delighted to  meet  and  interact  with 
              colleagues working in related fields, and to  learn  first-  hand  about  the 
              research and challenges in each others'  areas.  The  proposed venue for the
              Second Grantee Workshop is in  Oregon  from August 16th through August 18th,
              dates which have been found  to  be  in  minimal conflict with other meetings
              and which  allow  for  economical  pricing of rooms.  The proposed workshop 
              agenda  will  be  developed by a steering committee, with  feedback  from 
              participants of the last Grantee's Workshop.  The paramount goals  will  be  to
               foster fruitful exchange of ideas and to  stimulate  interaction among
              colleagues.  The workshop will  also produce an  HTML  document, modeled on the
              previous effort, which  summarizes  the  different  projects  supported by  the
               Interactive  Systems  Program.***
