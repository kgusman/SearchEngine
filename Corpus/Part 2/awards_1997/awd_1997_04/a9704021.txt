Abstract    :
              9704021  Jarell  This is a renewal grant to support work on a theoretical  study
              and numerical simulation of strongly correlated  electron materials.  The
              specific subjects include the high  temperature superconductors, heavy fermion
              materials, non-  Fermi liquid metals and exotic magnetic materials.  Quantum 
              Monte Carlo methods are combined with statistical inference  to calculate the
              dynamical response of the models of these  systems.  The study has two main
              objectives: The first is to  calculate, numerically and analytically, relevant
              properties  of the model systems as accurately as possible.  The second  is to
              explore the non-perturbative features of these models,  with the hope of
              finding new physical phenomena.  %%%  This grant continues the support of an
              active and  enthusiastic young PI who is rapidly emerging as a leader in  the
              general area of strongly correlated electrons.  This is  a class of materials
              which have wide ranging applications  but whose properties are not as well
              understood, at least so  far.  The class of materials include the high
              temperature  superconductors, heavy fermion materials, non-Fermi liquid  metals
              and exotic magnetic materials.  The proposed research  program utilizes a
              variety of theoretical and numerical  techniques and hopes to gain insight in
              to the observed  properties as well as discover new physical phenomena.  ***
