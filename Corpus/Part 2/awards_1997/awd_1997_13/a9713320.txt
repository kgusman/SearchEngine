Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9713320    Many chemical engineering educators work hard
              developing course materials and improving their teaching skills.  Once
              effective techniques are developed, they should be made available to a wider
              audience than just one university.  Indeed, since the field of chemical
              engineering has been changing, with distillation towers being augmented by
              membrane separation units, and packed bed reactors being augmented by CVD
              reactors, for example, the diffusion of new techniques and materials is even
              more important.  The Summer School for Chemical Engineering Faculty is
              organized by the Chemical Engineering Division of the American Society for
              Engineering Education and is held every five years.  The 1997 Summer School
              will be the twelfth in the series begun in 1931.    The objective of the Summer
              School is primarily to share course materials already developed.  The method to
              achieve the objectives will be to meet in a conference center, with activities
              planned from morning to night.  Workshops in specific subject areas will enable
              faculty to share, and demonstrate, their contributions while interacting with
              many participants.  Special workshops will be oriented towards Assistant
              Professors, while plenary lectures will be given that are applicable to all
              participants.  Workshops are planned in areas that NSF supports, including
              biotech, electronic materials, fluid-particle systems, environmental areas, and
              the use of computers.  In many schools undergraduate research projects are
              undertaken in these areas, so that the knowledge and experience gained in
              research can be transmitted to undergraduates.    It is hoped that one faculty
              member will attend from every school in the United States that awards chemical
              engineering B.S. degrees.  The home institution will supply travel funds, and
              the proposal is to pay for on-site expenses for some of the participants.  It
              is entirely possible that the Summer School will have an impact on every single
              B.S. graduate in Chemical Engineering in the Sp ring, 1998, plus of course all
              those that come after.
