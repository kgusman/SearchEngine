Abstract    :
              This is a study to quantitatively test the capabilities of a widely-used model
              of ionospheric plasma convection by comparing predictions to in situ
              electrostatic measurements from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
              (DMSP) satellites.  One of the critical needs of space weather forecasting is a
              reliable model of the polar cap ionospheric electrostatic potential
              distribution pattern and the cross cap potential drop as they respond to
              changing conditions in the solar wind.  To date the most comprehensive model is
              one using a spherical harmonic expansion based on data from the Dynamics
              Explorer-2 satellite.  The investigators will evaluate this model to provide
              quantitative descriptions of the deviations from in situ DMSP satellite
              measurements as a function of interplanetary magnetic field variability.   They
              will compare observed and predicted potential distributions along the satellite
              tracks to quantify differences attributable to time variations and real
              variations from the model.  Ultimately, this work will help develop more
              advanced models of the high-latitude potential distribution for use in space
              weather forecasts.
