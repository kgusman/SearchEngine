Abstract    :
              Lazarsfeld  9713149    This award supports work on a number of problems in
              algebraic geometry.  The first is to explore the connections between invariants
              from higher dimensional complex geometry and the rich classical geometry of
              abelian varieties and Riemann surfaces.  The principal investigator also
              proposes to continue his work on the geometry of irregular varieties, as well
              as on the problem of trying to find lower bounds on the local positivity of an
              ample line bundle at a very general point of a smooth projective variety of
              arbitrary dimension.  Finally, he will investigate some questions growing out
              of a recent observation with Bo Ilic to the effect that if X is a projective
              variety of dimension n with non-negative cotangent bundle, then the least
              degree of a projective embedding of X must grow essentially exponentially in n.
                 This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is
              one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated
              figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
              polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,
              but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
              fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
