Abstract    :
                 There is a fundamentally new intersection of computer  scientists,
              mathematicians and molecular biologists working in an  area loosely known as
              DNA computation, in which the basic set of  questions are in the process of
              being defined. The field was born  in 1994 when Len Adleman (USC) showed how to
              solve a version of  the traveling salesman problem using DNA (Molecular
              Computation  of Solutions to Combinatorial Problems. Science, 266, 1021-1024, 
              1994).   Adleman's paper had a catalytic effect on the scientific  imagination
              even though it admittedly solved only a "toy" problem  that could easily be
              solved using pencil and paper, let alone a  teraflop supercomputer. By clearly
              articulating the principles of  his computation, the massive parallelism
              inherent in DNA  reactions, the energy efficiency of these reactions, and the 
              enormous storage capacity of DNA, he challenged the community to  discover the
              limitations of this approach. Furthermore, it is  widely believed that, if
              these principles are scalable, the  potential of DNA computation would be truly
              spectacular. Richard  Lipton (Princeton) published a paper a few months later
              in  Science (DNA Solution of Hard Computational Problems. Science  268,
              542-545, 1995) generalizing Adleman's result to a  fundamental problem in the
              class of problems known as NP  complete.   The objectives of the Third DIMACS
              Workshop on DNA Based  Computers will be to present new work in the field and
              to  disseminate in printed and electronic form, information in all  areas that
              relate directly to computing with DNA including:  algorithms, applications,
              techniques, architectures, practical  obstacles to DNA based computers,
              proposed solutions to such  obstacles, computational processes in vivo, and 
              relevant  ideas regarding biological evolution. We will encourage papers 
              reporting experimental results.   The Organizing Committee is composed of a
              diverse group of  individuals from around the United States. The Committee has
              made  a commitment to make sure that st udents and investigators with  various
              and diverse backgrounds will attend the meeting. We  expect approximately 200
              individuals will attend.  DNA  Computation, is a relatively new field, without
              an established  Journal. The June International Meetings are the focus for the 
              field.   The Conference will be held at The University of Pennsylvania, 
              Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 23-25, 1997. The meeting will  be announced
              in several scientific journals as well on as on a  dedicated web site.  There
              will be three days of talks with time  for informal sessions and impromptu
              presentations. The  Proceedings of the Conference will be disseminated, as
              before, by  AMS- DIMACS.
