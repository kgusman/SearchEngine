Abstract    :
              This research will pursue developments in the boundary element method (BEM) for
              the analysis of stress and fracture mechanics problems dealing with anisotropic
              rock masses, including efficient techniques to model the role played by
              material anisotropy, rock fabric, and rock layering (heterogeneity) in rock
              engineering problems.    Focus will be on 2-D and 3-D elastostatic problems
              where the medium is either a continuum, a continuum with one or several
              interfaces, or a continuum with potentially propagating discrete cracks.  While
              the development will be generally applicable to any kind of body forces for
              which particular solutions can be derived, concentration will be on the body
              force of gravity.  For fracture problems, focus will be on the 2-D problem, and
              laboratory tests on natural and artificial rocks will also be conducted to
              determine experimentally the stress field and crack growth path in anisotropic
              and layered systems.  This research will provide new methods of engineering
              analysis that are currently lacking, providing a state-of-the-art methodology
              that can be easily implemented into computer codes and readily used by a wide
              range of engineers, designers, and researchers.  Completion of this project
              will greatly enhance the range of applications of the BEM to rock mechanics and
              fracture problems involving anisotropic and layered systems including fault
              mechanics and earthquake-induced displacement and stresses, hydraulic
              fracturing, hydraulic jacking, borehole breakout, and in-situ stress
              determination, rock cutting and drilling, and the design and stability of
              underground excavation and rock  slopes.
