Abstract    :
              Abstract - Gundersen  CTS - 9713275        This is a study of the physics and
              engineering of non-equilibrium plasmas generated by extremely short
              high-voltage pulses with an emphasis on pollution-abatement applications.  The
              project combines modulator design, advanced diagnostics, and sophisticated
              modelling to provide basic insight into the plasma reactors, their underlying
              physics, and their applications.  Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) using a
              tunable laser system will be utilized in reactors driven by advanced power
              sources to obtain data about specific species including nitrogen oxides (NOx)
              and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The results will be modelled with a
              time-dependent two-dimensional hybrid Monte Carlo/fluid model.  This model will
              then be used to simulate the effects of parameters such as reactor geometry,
              amplitude of the applied voltage, chemical additives, and bulk flow parameters,
              and the results used in design of reactors for specific applications.
