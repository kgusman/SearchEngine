Abstract    :
              9713944  Bazant  The fracture mechanics of concrete has progressed greatly,  but
              only for tensile fracture, which is essentially a  uniaxial phenomenon.  The
              fracture mechanics of compression  fracture, which is  a triaxial phenomenon,
              is essentially  unavailable.   The present proposal, involving both 
              theoretical and experimental studies, attempts to fill this  gap.  The
              theoretical program involves:  (1) energy-based  mathematical model for the
              propagation of a  band of axial  splitting crack (with internal buckling of
              microcracked  material);  (2) asymptotic analysis of size effect and shape 
              effect, leading to simple `asymptotic-matching' formulas;  (3) formulation of
              size-effect method for deternining  compression fracture characteristics; (4)
              generalization of  the existing microplane model for damage in compression, 
              with consideration of the effect of time or loading rate;  and (5) application
              to the analysis of explosive failure of  high-strength concrete columns or
              walls subjected to fire.  The experimental program, designed to verify and
              calibrate  the theory, involves:  (1) size-effect tests of double-  cantilever
              fracture specimens with compression-tension  loading; (2) size effect tests of
              compression fracture of  cylindrical specimens with small or large notches; and
              (3)  tests of the influence of rate or time.  ***
