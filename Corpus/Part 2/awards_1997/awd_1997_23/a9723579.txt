Abstract    :
                9723579  Ketchum      Potassium ion channels catalyze the transport of K+
              across  cellular membranes.  These proteins are part of a large family of 
              cation transporters found in all three domains of life,  Eubacteria, Archae,
              and Eukarya.  All members of this family have  a common structural motif
              (M1-P-M2) consisting of a highly  conserved pore-region (P) bordered by two
              membrane-spanning  helices (M1,M2).  Sub-families are distinguished by the
              presence  of additional membrane segments, multiple M1-P-M2 motifs, or 
              associated regulatory domains.   These differences indicate that  both
              intragenic duplication and domain fusion have played a role  in the evolution
              of ion channel genes.   The first complete  sequence of an Archeon,
              Methanococcus jannaschii, was recently  published.  Three open reading frames
              (MJ0138, MJ0139 and MJ1357)  were identified which encoded peptide segments
              similar to the P-  region of K+ selective channels found in eukaryotes.  MJ0138
              and  MJ1357 have a predicted membrane topology similar to inward  rectifier
              channels with two transmembrane segments.  In contrast  MJ0139 is analogous to
              Shaker K channels with 5 hydrophobic  regions.  MJ0139 is immediately followed
              by MJ0138 on the  chromosome. These proteins are translated in the same reading
               frame and separated by 3 nucleotides of a stop codon.  Their M1-P-  M2
              sequences display 65% identity suggesting that the adjacent  pore motifs
              originated from an incomplete, intragenic  duplication.  The fusion of these
              two would result in a coding  sequence similar to that of tandem pore channels
              found in  eukaryotes.  Thus these Archaeon sequences may represent an 
              intermediate stage in K+ channel evolution.  This research will examine the
              transport activity of the three  channel proteins from M. jannaschii, and
              determine whether these  proteins function in a similar way as the channels
              found in  eukaryotes.  Each protein will be put in two experimental systems 
              where K+ transport can be monitored: budding yeast cell and  Xenpo us oocytes. 
              A comprehensive computer analysis of K+ channel  genes  from eubacteria,
              Archaea and Eukarya will be done, to  identify conserved structural motifs and 
              establish the evolution  of this gene family.  %%%  The research in this grant
              will study the function and genetic  sequence of a new type of K+ channel in
              Archaea, and compare this  to similar studies in yeast and eukaryotes.  These
              studies will  provide important information on the evolution and function of 
              these channels which are important for the transport of K and the  maintenance
              of ionic charge in cells.  ***
