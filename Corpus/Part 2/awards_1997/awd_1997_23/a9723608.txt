Abstract    :
              9723608   Hooper  NH2OH is oxidized (NH2OH + H2O -> HNO2 + 4e- + 4H+) by the
              enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, "HAO", the most complex hemoprotein known,
              which contains 7 c-hemes and 1 substrate-binding heme P460 per 63 kDa subunit. 
              The latter is a novel tyrosine-derivatized c-heme.  At least two pairs of the
              hemes interact electronically and one of the pairs forms the active site. A
              second hydroxylamine-oxidizing enzyme, "cytochrome P460", has one metal center
              which is a lysine-derivatized c-heme and it, together with a cytochrome P-460
              from M.capsulatus, will be studied. A crystal structure for HAO has recently
              appeared which allows one to  propose and test distinct catalytic mechanisms
              involving Fe-N or C-N intermediates, identify and probe important prosthetic
              groups and amino acids in the active site, and investigate structural elements
              responsible for the magnetic interactions previously observed between metal
              centers.  The focus of this project is on HAO and cytochromes P460.  Approaches
              include  peptide analysis, DNA and protein sequencing, kinetics, suicide
              substrates, potentiometry, Optical-, EPR-, Mossbauer-, resonance Raman-, and
              ENDOR- spectroscopies and X-ray crystallographic analysis.    In soils,
              Nitrosomonas  helps oxidize ammonia to the form of nitrogen needed by  crops.  
              In flooded soils fertilizer nitrogen can also be lost by conversion by 
              Nitrosomonas to the gas, nitrous oxide (N20), a greenhouse gas and a catalyst
              of  ozone destruction. The process studied here is also the limiting step in
              the removal of ammonia in waste water treatment. Finally, Nitrosomonas will
              also catalyze degradation of many chlorinated pollutants. An understanding of
              the biochemistry of the organism involved could lead to more efficient use of
              fertilizer-nitrogen, decreased production of nitrous oxide,  improvements in
              the waste water treatment, and improved on-site bioremediation of contaminated
              soils.
