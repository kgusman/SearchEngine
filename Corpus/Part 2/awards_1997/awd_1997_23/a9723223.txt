Abstract    :
                This project will plan the development of a biological database for  the genus
              Peromyscus (deer mice and 55 allied species). Mice of the  genus Peromyscus are
              extremely abundant throughout North America  and are widely used in pure and
              applied research. Research areas in  which Peromyscus is commonly used includes
              ecology, genetics,  systematics, evolution, behavior, physiology, metabolism, 
              parasitology, epidemiology, and toxicology. Currently there is no 
              comprehensive database for this significant group of organisms,  although more
              than 3500 journal articles have been published and  several hundred
              investigators currently use peromyscines in their  research. The database
              envisioned, although including genetics, is  expected to contain a broad range
              of information concerning many  aspects of the biology of these rodents. This
              database, therefore,  will differ substantially from the several mammalian
              genomic  databases currently accessible. The long-range objective is to have 
              about eight or nine topical components of the database up to date  and readily
              accessible on the Internet.         The Peromyscus Data Base (PDB) will be
              developed and operated  through the Department of Computer Science and the
              Department of  Biological Sciences, Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center, of the 
              University of South Carolina at Columbia. Other institutions may  become
              involved as planning progresses. Several existing free-  standing databases
              will be incorporated into the overall database.
