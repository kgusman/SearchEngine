Abstract    :
              9723033  Randall  Drumming on the ground to create mechanical vibrations is an 
              important means  of communication in open, desert environments, and is 
              widespread  among desert rodents. Both solitary kangaroo rats,  Dipodomys, from
              North  America and social gerbils, Rhombomys, from Central Asia  exhibit
              footdrummming  in the presence of predators. Because this behavior costs  time
              and energy and is  dangerous, it must provide some benefit. The objective of 
              this study is to  determine why desert rodents place themselves at risk by 
              footdrumming in the  presence of predators. Behavioral observations and 
              experiments with snake  and mammalian predators in the field will test
              predictions  that solitary  kangaroo rats footdrum to communicate directly to
              the  predator that the rat  is alert and the predator's chances of successful
              capture  are low, while  social gerbils footdrum to warn relatives and
              offspring of  danger. Results  of the study will contribute to our
              understanding of  footdrumming as a  unique form of mammalian communication and
              its function as  anti-predator  behavior in ground-dwelling desert rodents. The
              study should  lead to a  greater understanding of how predation acts as a
              selective  force on prey  behavior and contribute to recovery programs of
              endangered  species of  kangaroo rat.
