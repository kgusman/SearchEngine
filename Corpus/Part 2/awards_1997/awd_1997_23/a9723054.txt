Abstract    :
                    Trinkaus  9723054    The overall objective of the proposed research is to
              understand how normal tissue cells and cancer cells move invasively within
              organisms - as individual cells, cell clusters, cell streams and as cell
              sheets. Since there is now abundant evidence that normal tissue cells and
              cancer cells utilize the same mechanisms for their invasive movements, both in
              vitro and in viva, any increase in understanding how one moves will aid in
              understanding the movement of the other. The emphasis in this research is on
              the mechanism of cell motility, particularly during directional cell movements,
              how cells make contacts with each other and with various substrata over which
              they move, how tightly-joined cells in epithelia move to rearrange, and how
              their movements are coordinated, and how cells respond to possible exogenous
              signals and move directionally. More specifically, the investigations will be
              concerned with protrusive activity of the cell surface, particularly at the
              leading edge, contractility, cytoplasmic structure and programmed endocytosis
              as morphogenetic mechanisms, the organization of actin-containing
              microfilaments as related to cytoplasmic contractilitv, and tension during
              gastrulation, presence and orientation of microtubules as related to the
              spreading movements of cortical cytoplasm during epibolv, the ingression of
              cells at the surface of the gastrula as related to the formation of the
              epiblast and hypoblast, the role of contact inhibition and other coordinated
              interactions between and among cells during directional morphogenetic cell
              movements, and the possible role of retraction induced protrusive activity in
              the promotion of the persistence of cell movements in a particular direction.
              The principal techniques that will be utilized are: cell culture, high
              resolution differential interference contrast and phase contrast optics,
              confocal micrography, time-lapse video filming of moving cells in vivo and in
              vitro, high resolution photomicrography, microsurgery and micr omanipulation
              for transplantation and deletion experiments, inhibiting cell contractility
              with cytochalazin D and depolymerizing microtubules with nocodazole and
              immobilizing them with taxol, staining microtubules with fluorescent antibodies
              against tubulin, microinjecting fluorescent labels to follow moving cells,
              transmission and scanning electron microscopy - all in relation to cell
              motility. As many of these techniques as apply will be brought to bear in the
              analysis of each problem.
