Abstract    :
              The structure of the phytoplankton community in the North Water Polynya will be
              studied during the summer of 1998.  The North Water is a predictable, recurrent
              area of open water situated in northern Baffin Bay, which is ice-free beginning
              in March.  The taxonomy of diatoms and flagellates from Baffin Bay has been
              studied in previous decades, and primary production was measured at a few
              stations in the southern area of the North Water in the 1970's.  Other than
              these studies and a 48 hour study in May 1991, little is known of the
              biological oceanography of this area which is very rich in marine mammals and
              birds. The proposed project will quantify, using epifluorescence microscopy,
              the algal populations belonging to various groups, such as diatoms, autotrophic
              dinoflagellates and other autotrophic flagellates in terms of cell
              concentration and biomass (as carbon) of individual taxa.  The project will be
              part of the International North Water Polynya Study comprising physical,
              chemical and biological studies of the area, and samples will be collected in
              conjunction with the Canadian study of primary production.  The relation
              between phytoplankton community structure and physical, chemical and biological
              parameters will be examined.  Conclusions will be drawn as to which
              environmental conditions lead to removal of carbon to the benthos, and which
              lead to carbon remaining in the upper layers. In collaboration with other
              investigators, the consequences of a possible future warming of the North Water
              will be explored, especially the effects of existing food chains.
