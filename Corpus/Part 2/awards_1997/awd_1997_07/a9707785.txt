              ABSTRACT    97-07785  Turchin  Dispersal as a mechanistic basis for landscape
              ecology: The role of scale and heterogeneity    In recent years it has become
              clear that understanding spatial dynamics of populations, including the effects
              of habitat fragmentation, is critical for developing better methods of managing
              natural resources. Landscape ecology has developed approaches for describing
              environmental patterns in space, while population ecology has a strong
              tradition of research on mechanisms that underlie these patterns. This project
              will bridge these two directions in ecology, using a simple organism in a
              simple environment. The study organism, a terrestrial isopod ("pillbug"), has a
              simple biology,  and its environment, the Negev Desert of Israel, provides a
              simplified landscape with a clear limiting factor, water. This research will
              focus on dispersal as the most important mechanism explaining isopod spatial
              distribution in relation to the distribution of resources. Studying this system
              will yield general insights into how spatial population dynamics work, and will
              eventually lead to better understanding of more complex ecological systems.
