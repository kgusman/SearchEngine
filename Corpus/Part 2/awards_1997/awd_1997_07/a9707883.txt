Abstract    :
              Southeast Asia harbors the greatest diversity of higher primates (monkeys and
              apes) in the old world.  Despite this diversity, and a long history of its
              study, there is little agreement on the number of species and genera that exist
              and how they are related to one another.  The need to establish a basic
              consensus on these issues is extremely important to the study of our own
              evolution and vital to the conservation management of these unique Asian
              primates.  The primary goals of this project are to: (1) use a comprehensive
              set of molecular data to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among
              Asia's macaque monkeys, leaf monkeys, and gibbon apes; (2) reconstruct the
              evolutionary histories of these three groups of higher primates by
              simultaneously considering their respective evolutionary relationships, their
              current geographical distributions, and what we know of the geological
              processes, climate and ecology of the regions in which this great
              diversification took place at the time it was occurring; and (3) define the
              appropriate taxonomic units and geographical regions for the conservation of
              the species that each group contains.  The successful completion of this
              project will add significantly to our understanding of mammalian evolution and
              to the conservation of primate biodiversity.
