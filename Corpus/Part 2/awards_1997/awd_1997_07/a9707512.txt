Abstract    :
              9707512  Edwards  The goal of the proposal research is to investigate  molecular
              transport across the major transport barriers of  the eye.  Despite the
              importance of sight, a fundamental  understanding of transport in the eye is
              still lacking.  A  mathematical model without fitted parameters will be 
              developed to predict solute transport rates across the  cornea and the sclera
              given the physiochemical properties of  the compounds.  The model will be vased
              on the real  ultrastructure of each barrier, and will relate the  geometrical
              parameters and chemical composition of each  tissue to its macroscopic
              measurable transport properties.    The importance of understanding molecular
              transport in the  eye is several fold.  The natural function of the eye, like 
              all organs of the body, is directly related to the transport  of water, solute,
              and ionic species.  For instance, glucose  is required by the corneal
              epithelium for energy production,  and it reaches the cells by diffusion from
              the aqueous  humor.  Another example is that of keratocyte migration to  the
              wound site following stomal injury, possibly under the  attraction of an
              electrical field.  Characterization of the  structure and function of the eye
              is often made by measuring  transport properties such as diffusivity,
              permeability and  electrical conductivity.  A quantitative understanding of 
              transport in the eye can aid in the interpretation of these  data.  The ability
              to predict transport rates also has  direct application to eye drug delivery.  
               The principal aims of the model are:  1) to predict the  water and solute
              permeability of the cornea and the sclera  as a function of hydration, collagen
              and proteoglycan  content, fibril distribution, and the size and partition 
              coefficient of the solute; 2) to determine the electrical  resistance
              properties of the two barriers; and 3) to  simulate transient transport of
              nutrients in the cornea.  ***
