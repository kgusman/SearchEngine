              Finney, Bruce P.  University of Alaska    Title: Paleohydrology Across Central
              Alaska: A Multiproxy Approach  to Lake-Level Records    The primary objective
              of this project is to produce new multi-proxy  paleoclimate records from
              Central Alaska to test hypotheses  concerning the cause of shifts in the
              precipitation-evaporation  balance from 18 ka to present.  The award supports
              research to: (i)  expand the network of sites with decadal to century-scale
              lake-  level data to identify the spatial and temporal pattern of changes  in
              the precipitation-evaporation balance and (ii) identify  fluctuations in the
              moisture balance for the past 2000 years at  annual to decadal-scale from
              closed basin Dune Lake.  These records  are needed to understand the long-term
              atmospheric dynamics of the  Arctic and to assess the significance of shifts in
              the  precipitation-evaporation balance.  The Holocene climate history of  the
              region will be reconstructed with a series of studies analyzing  the
              sedimentology, geochemistry, magnetic properties, pollen  content, stable
              isotopic composition, and for the first time in the  Arctic, biomarker
              compounds.  The lake cores will be dated at high-  resolution by 137Cs, 210Pb
              and AMS 14C measurements on macrofossils and  pollen.
