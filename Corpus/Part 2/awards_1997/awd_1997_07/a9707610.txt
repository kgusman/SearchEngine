Abstract    :
              9707610  Levin    An important process shaping the ecology of any organisms in
              nature is coevolution, the  evolutionary interplay among distinct species. 
              Understanding coevolution requires mathematical and computer models to describe
              how interactions among species change over long time intervals; yet the
              construction and analysis of such models is rarely possible because of
              inadequate understanding of the biological processes, and the complexity of the
              mathematical description.  Empirical work by the investigators, however, has
              produced useful short-term models of interactions between insects and their
              pathogens, and mathematical breakthroughs in the PI's lab have greatly
              simplified long term coevolutionary models.  In this research, the
              investigators will apply these advances to understanding how host-pathogen
              interactions, especially in insects, are affected by the coevolution of host
              and pathogen.  Because insects are important agricultural pests, and because
              pathogens are important natural means of pest control, the research will have
              direct and important environmental applications.
