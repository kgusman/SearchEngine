Abstract    :
              A variety of problems in both medical diagnostics and nondestructive testing of 
              materials requires the reconstruction of a portion or cross section of an
              object  without directly viewing its interior.  Tomographic imaging techniques
              allow  noninvasive/nondestructive studies which minimize patient trauma and
              cost in the  medical domain, and reduce manufacturing and maintenance expenses
              for many  industries by transforming external measurements into images of the
              interior of  the patient or object.  The established methods for computing
              tomographic images  in common examples such as x-ray CT scanning are inadequate
              for difficult cases  involving a shortage of data or great uncertainty in their
              precise values due to  inherent error in measurements.  For these problems,
              algorithms are needed which  explicitly take into account the characteristics
              of the measurement errors as  well as common behavior of the tissue or
              materials under study.    Much improvement has resulted from statistical
              methods such as Bayesian  tomographic estimation, but conventional estimation
              techniques, based on  homogeneous random field models and fixed optimization
              strategies, seem to be  approaching their limits of improvement.  This project
              is developing three  principal innovations to improve the capabilities of
              tomographic systems, with  particular focus on three-dimensional applications:
              (1) nonhomogeneous image  cross section models which allow spatially varying
              image characteristics to be  accurately estimated using a simple multiscale
              estimation procedure; (2) fast  nonlinear optimization algorithms for
              minimizing the nonquadratic functions that  result from MAP estimation with
              nonGaussian prior models; (3) a novel approach  to tomographic reconstruction
              based on nonlinear, non-iterative estimation from  back projection data.  This
              research is applicable to the full range of emission  and transmission
              tomographic problems, with particular experimental focus on 3D  medical
              emission tomography.
