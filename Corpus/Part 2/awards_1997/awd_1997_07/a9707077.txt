              Keil  OPP 9707077    Abstract  This award supports travel for students and
              scientists from the  Former Soviet Union to participate in the 60th Annual
              Meeting of  the Meteoritical Society, which will be held in the Maui Prince 
              Hotel, Maui, Hawaii, from July 21-25, 1997, under the  organizational
              sponsorship of the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics  and Planetology, University
              of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii,  96822.  Additional support is being
              provided by NASA, The  Barringer Foundation, JEOL USA, Inc., Cameca, Inc., and
              Pallasite  Press. The principal scientific focus of the meeting is on 
              meteorites as clues to the origin and evolution of the solar  system.    Annual
              meetings of the Meteoritical Society are technical  conferences, not
              conventions, and are international in nature.  Because of the latter the venue
              generally alternates between  Europe and the US, reflecting the sub-equal
              Society membership  from the two continents.  Countries represented at most of
              the  meetings include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,  France,
              Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia,  Switzerland, the UK, and the
              United States.  Attendance at the  meetings over the past 14 years has mostly
              been in the range 250-  400 persons, including guests.  The largest meeting on
              record was  Vienna, with 449 participants plus guests.  Because of the 
              location of the 1997 meeting in Maui, Hawaii, attendance is  expected to be
              very high, probably in excess of 400.    The subject matter of the conference
              is dominated by mineralogic,  isotopic and chemical studies of meteorites,
              theoretical studies  of early solar system processes, and field and theoretical
               studies of impact phenomena.  The overall scientific theme is  learning about
              the formation and evolution of our solar system  and its components, and solar
              systems in general.  Recent topics  of great interest at Meteoritical Society
              meetings have included  the nature and origin of interstellar grains that have
              been found  preserved in chondrite mete orites; the distribution of short- 
              lived radionuclides in the newly-formed solar system and their  possible role
              in early planetary melting; the nature of volatiles  in Martian (SNC)
              meteorites and their implications for the  volatile budget on Mars; the
              possible astrophysical sites (star  types) from which isotopically-anomalous
              material known to be  present in the early solar system was derived; and
              possible  secular variations in the meteorite population bombarding Earth  over
              the past several tens of thousands of years.    The Maui meeting is comprised
              of five days of  two concurrent  technical sessions, as well as Poster
              Sessions. Most of the  papers  are contributed rather than invited; many are
              given by  students.  The usual format is 10 minutes for presentation  followed
              by 5 minutes for questions.  All sessions, will be held  in the Maui Prince
              Hotel, which has new, superb lecture  facilities. The Meteoritical Society
              Meeting will be preceded by  an LPI-HIGP-sponsored Workshop on "Parent body and
              nebular  modification of chondritic materials", and it is anticipated that 
              many of the participants of the Meteoritical Society Meeting will  also
              participate in the Workshop.      Special Data Elements    A.   7 N - -  B.   F
