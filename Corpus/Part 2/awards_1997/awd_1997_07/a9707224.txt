Abstract    :
              9707224  MARSH    Of the more than a million species of bacteria thought to
              exist on Earth today, only several thousand have been named and described
              carefully.  The characteristics of these undescribed lifeforms may be rather
              different from those that are known.  Strains of bacteria have been isolated
              recently from sedimentary rocks deposited ca. 95 million years ago and
              currently lying 150-200 meters below the earthOs surface.  Some of these
              strains contain DNA sequences, representing the small-subunit ribosomal RNA
              gene, that most closely resemble those of the chloroplasts of algae and land
              plants, not other bacteria.  Are these sequences native to the bacteria, or did
              they come from some other source?  If native, are these bacteria (surprisingly)
              closely related to plastids?  If not native, how did these genes get into, and
              stay within, the bacteria, in competition with the similar genes already there?
                 To answer these and related questions, Tery Marsh and Frans de Bruijn will
              conduct molecular biological research on cultivated bacteria from these deep
              strata that appear to bear plastid-like DNA sequences.  They will attempt to
              determine whether the plastid-like genes are part of the major (OgenomicO) DNA
              molecules of these bacteria or are carried on smaller fragments (OplasmidsO). 
              They will sequence additional genes from these bacteria to determine whether
              they also resemble counterpart genes in chloroplasts.  They will also look for
              ways to label these bacteria and others from the same or similar habitats,
              using fluorescent markers.
