Abstract    :
              Abstract - Cooper - 9707934      Application of the float process technique to
              the fabrication of defect-free flat panels of complex-composition
              aluminosilicate glass and glass-ceramic melts requires a fundamental
              understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions between the
              complex silicate and the molten metal or metal alloy upon which it is poured. 
              The PI plans to study the reactions and kinetic mechanisms of silicate melt
              reduction, metal-float-medium oxidation and the consequent chemical diffusion
              between the metal and silicate media that are the thermochemical/thermophysical
              bases of the float process.  The study is designed to identify the optimal
              chemical approach to successfully floating a complex silicate melt that
              incorporates a significant amount of a transition metal oxide in its
              composition.  The experimental study will scrutinize the chemical dynamics of a
              magnesium aluminosilicate (MAS) melt and its transition metal cation-doped
              derivatives in contact with molten tin and tin alloys.  Specifically, the base
              MAS composition to be studied is 1MgO-1Al2O3-4SiO2 (molar basis), which is a
              fully polymerized melt; transition metal cations to be substituted (doped-in;
              initially at approximately a 5-cation mol.% level) are Fe2+-Fe3+ in one case
              and Ti4+ in another.      The reactions of the glass melt with the pure metal
              and metal alloy(s) will be characterized both with ion backscattering
              spectroscopy as well as with energy- and wavelength-dispersive x-ray
              spectroscopies via an electron probe.  The project is being funded under the
              Small Grants for Exploratory Research program.
