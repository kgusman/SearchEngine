Abstract    :
                                  DMR-9707358    Partial  support  is  being provided  for the
              symposium  entitled  European  Gordon Research Conference on Solid State
              Chemistry  to  be  held  at  Queens College, Oxford, England,  September 
              20-25,  1997.   It  will bring together researchers with expertise  in  a 
              broad range of topics considered to be at the forefront of global  issues  in
              solid state chemistry and materials. The support  will  be provided for the
              educational aspects of the conference, namely  to  provide money for a
              "scholarship" program to support 10  U.S.  contributions from students,
              postdocs, and new faculty,  and  for  registration   and  partial  travel 
              support   for   other   U.S.  participants  of renown in the area of solid
              state chemistry  and  materials.  The cost of  U.S. participation in this
              international  meeting is being cost shared by the Gordon Research Conference. 
              %%%  This  is  one  of  four major meetings on solid  state  chemistry 
              occurring  in 1996-1997 that will receive NSF support  and  which  together 
              will help to serve as an information base for  the  NSF  Workshop  on Solid
              State Chemistry to be held late in  1997.  The  purpose  of  this  meeting  is 
              to bring  together  international  researchers with expertise over a broad
              range of topical areas in  solid state chemistry and materials to survey those
              considered to  be of high priority by the international community.  ***
