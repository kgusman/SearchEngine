Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-07383  Lidstrom  Environmental significance of population
              diversity in methane-oxidizing bacteria    This project investigates different
              classes of methane-using bacteria to ascertain their properties in a natural
              ecosystem: the sediments of Lake Washington, Seattle.  Newly developed
              environmental gene probes will be used to enumerate specific classes of
              methane-utilizing bacteria, and these results will be correlated with process
              measurements for trace gas cycling by these bacteria. Bacteria that use methane
              gas are important components of natural ecosystems.  Methane gas is produced
              from the natural breakdown of dead organisms, and these bacteria consume this
              gas, keeping the carbon in the methane within the ecosystem.  Methane gas that
              escapes from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems enters the atmosphere, where it
              becomes a greenhouse gas with a potentially significant contribution to global
              warming. It is important to understand natural populations of methane-utilizing
              bacteria, and the details of how these bacteria cycle trace gases such as
              methane.
