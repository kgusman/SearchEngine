Abstract    :
              9707084  Pittenger  In 1997 Scripps Institute of Oceanography will operate 
              research vessels MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and ROBERT GORDON  SPROUL and the new
              age AGOR 24, RODGER REVELLE, in support  of NSF-sponsored oceanographic
              research.  The R/V MELVILLE  will support a cruise in the Indian Ocean for WOCE
              and 2  cruises South of Australia in support of Marine Geology and 
              Geophysical.  The vessel will than work its way back to San  Diego doing an MGG
              cruise.  Following a cruise to the Gulf  of Alaska for NAVO, the MELVILLE ends
              the year with 2  cruises off the coast of California and Mexico.  The R/V 
              REVELLE schedule has gone through many iterations.  In the  current schedule
              the vessel will start 1997 by supporting  two cruise off NOAA cruise.  The
              vessel will undergo final  contract trials for the pending.  The REVELLE will
              end 1997  in support of JGOFS in the southern oceans.  The R/V NEW  HORIZON
              will support a variety of biological and physical  oceanography projects off
              the west coast of the US and  Mexico.  R/V ROBERT GORDON SPROUL will do short
              cruises off  the coast of California and one cruise in the Columbia River 
              estuary.       The SIO vessels are part of a fleet utilized by the  National
              Science Foundation in support of oceanographic  research.  Most oceanographic
              projects require highly  specialized equipment and extensive support from the
              ship's  crew members.  Increasingly research projects require  equipment which
              must be permanently installed on the vessel,  thus requiring specialized ships.
               The ships do not operate  the same as general cargo/fishing vessels,
              therefore, NSF  supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically 
              dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by  universities and
              research institutes around the country.
