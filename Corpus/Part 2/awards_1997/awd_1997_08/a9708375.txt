Abstract    :
              9708375  Kinzie  Detritivores in headwater streams of forested catchments obtain
              their energy and nutrients primarily from riparian leaf litter input. In the
              process of shredding and scraping leaf litter they transform microbially
              conditioned leaves into organic particulates used by downstream suspension
              feeders. This proposal will investigate the following questions. Do some
              detritivore species play essential roles in this processing? Are other species
              redundant in determining the rate of leaf processing and export of suspended
              particulates to downstream consumers? The loss of one or more detritivore
              species may alter leaf processing in fluvial ecosystems, yet stream ecologists
              lack an empirical, stream-based approach for determining if species have unique
              roles in leaf litter processing or if their interactions are important to other
              detritivores. The loss of one or more species will not influence overall rates
              of processing if detritivore species are redundant and have no interactive or
              unique species-specific role in leaf-litter processing. Alternatively, rates of
              instream leaf-litter processing will decrease with the loss or replacement of
              certain benthic detritivore species if these species perform key functions.
              This research will determine if different detritivore species function either
              independently of each other, as substitutes or replacements for one another, in
              a negative, inhibitory manner, or in a positive, facilitative manner.   Results
              of this research in isolated streams will provide data for cross-site
              comparisons among different species of detritivores from on-going studies of
              leaf-litter processing at the Luquillo LTER site. In addition, this research
              will provide insight into the effects of introduced species on ecosystem
              function in comparison to the functional role on apparently similar, native
              species.
