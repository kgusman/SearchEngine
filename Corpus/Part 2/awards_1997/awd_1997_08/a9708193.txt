Abstract    :
                   This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   chemistry
              program supports research in the laboratory of Dr. James A.   Larrabee at
              Middlebury College under the Research in Undergraduate   Institutions (RUI)
              initiative.  Dr. Larrabee's research group will   investigate coupled binuclear
              cobalt complexes as models for the active   site in methionine amino peptidase
              (MAP).  Variable-temperature,   variable-field magnetic circular dichroism
              (MCD) will be used to probe   the ground state electronic structure of this
              recently discovered enzyme.    Zero-field splitting and magnetic exchange
              constants will be determined   for model compounds and protein systems.  Since
              substrate molecules may   bind across the cobalt ions, changes in metal-metal
              exchange coupling may   be important in the functioning of the enzyme.       An
              unusual cobalt-cobalt active site in a newly discovered enzyme,   methionine
              amino peptidase, will be probed by magnetic circular   dichroism.  These
              spectroscopic studies will be carried on model   compounds and other proteins,
              which have a dinuclear cobalt site   substituted into them.  Comparisons
              between the model compounds,   theoretical models and the actual enzyme will be
              made in order to   understand the functioning of the active site in the enzyme.
