Abstract    :
                  This collaborative research project represents one of the first  
              comprehensive biological process studies to be carried in the   Arctic Ocean
              over a full annual cycle.  Investigators from Oregon   State University, the
              Canadian Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans, and   from other U.S. institutions will
              use a Canadian icebreaker as   home base for a 14-month period to study the
              seasonal cycle of   biological production and respiration, and the seasonal
              cycle in   biomass of algae, bacteria, protists, and zooplankton, in the  
              central Arctic.    The research program will be organized around continuous  
              measurement of dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper water   column.
              Dissolved oxygen content integrates the sum of production   and respiration in
              both the water column and in the overlying sea   ice. Continual monitoring of
              dissolved oxygen will allow detection   of the initial spring increase in
              primary production, and of   transient algal blooms, that may be missed by a
              discontinuous   sampling program. Concentration of inorganic nutrients in the  
              upper 100 m, concentration of dissolved and particulate organic   matter in the
              water and in sea ice, biomass of autotrophic and   heterotrophic organisms in
              the water column and sea ice, uptake   rates of carbon and nitrogen by
              phytoplankton, and respiration   rates of the planktonic community, will be
              analyzed at least   weekly.    The seasonal study of production/respiration
              processes will   provide valuable information regarding: 1) the present
              structure   and function of central Arctic ecosystems, which can serve as a  
              baseline for evaluating the impact of future global change   processes in this
              sensitive region; and 2) the nature and timing   of production and respiration
              processes in a high latitude system   and in particular how the heterotrophic
              community survives during   the dark winter months.
