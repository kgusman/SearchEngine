Abstract    :
              9703476  Green    The objective of this symposium is to provide a specific 
              unique focus on the science and technology of nondestructive  evaluation
              applied to materials characterization.  Properties of interest include
              microstructure, residual  stress, dislocation density, porosity, and cure
              state.  This  symposium gathers together the technologists of  nondestructive
              methods with mechanical engineers and  materials scientists both to explore the
              applications of  nondestructive characterization and the solutions to the 
              problems encountered.  Papers include research and  applications for aging
              infrastructure, resonant ultrasound  spectroscopy, on-line measurements for
              process control,  precision and accuracy of nondestructive characterization 
              measurements, advances in computed assisted tomography,  non-contact
              ultrasonics, and microwave advances and  applications.  Research and
              applications in the  nondestructive testing and evaluation of material 
              characteristics such as yield strength, ductility, elastic  modulus, grain
              size, microstructure, texture, fiber  placement, and residual stress are
              discussed.  Of  considerable interest are state-of-the-art developments  where
              the complex nature of materials has been recognized.  Furthermore, discussions
              on the applications and  possibilities for multi-technique measurements of 
              interdependent parameters and the evaluation of the data  through sophisticated
              computer analysis are encouraged.  The proceedings of this symposium will be
              published as a  bound volume entitled ONondestructive Characterization of 
              Materials VIII.O  %%%  Advances in nondestructive evaluation are important to
              the  application of new and advanced materials, manufacturing,  and the
              monitoring of infrastructure performance and useful  life.  ***
