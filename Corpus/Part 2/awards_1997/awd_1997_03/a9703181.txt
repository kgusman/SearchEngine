Abstract    :
              The implementation of the National Information Infrastructure initiative will 
              require the efficient transmission and storage of voluminous amounts of 
              multimedia traffic, particularly image and video data.  This project offers a 
              multidisciplinary attack on this challenging problem with the goal of providing
               a system-wide optimized solution rather than a possibly mismatched collection
              of  efficient subsystem solutions.  It advocates an integration, in both
              research and  education, of relevant aspects of three engineering subfields
              that have been  traditionally treated separately: Signal Processing,
              Communications, and  Networks.  The primary educational goals are to help
              develop interdisciplinary  specialists, and to integrate research more heavily
              into engineering education.    This project promotes an adaptive and integrated
              approach to the algorithmic  design and architecture of next-generation visual
              communications systems for the  compression and reliable delivery, over noisy
              time-varying channels and  heterogeneous networks, of images and video. A
              unifying thread is the use of  flexible multiresolution-based frameworks for 1)
              source coding, 2) channel coding  and 3) joint source-channel coding, with the
              goal of maximizing the delivered  image/video quality using fast algorithms. 
              In education, the primary goals are  to help develop multidisciplinary
              specialists, and to integrate research more  heavily into both undergraduate
              and graduate education.
