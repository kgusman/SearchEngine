Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build on
              the successful imaging Raman instrument demonstrated in Phase I, and produce
              second-generation instruments and software which fully exploit the potential of
              this new technique. In Phase I, chemical species were imaged using a narrowband
              liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and CCD camera integrated into a Raman
              microscope. Diffraction-limited spatial images were obtained with complete (and
              spatially independent) Raman spectra at each pixel in the image, yielding an
              image cube with two spatial axes and one spectral axis. The novel LCTF approach
              renders high-definition Raman imaging feasible for the first time, and brings
              the power and specificity inherent in Raman spectral analysis to the imaging of
              chemical species. In Phase II, key improvements will be made: transmission will
              be doubled (or more) based on a high-efficiency design identified in Phase I,
              and the longwavelength limit will be extended from the present 700 nm to 1050
              nm. Such an LCTF appears to offer near-revolutionary benefits in certain
              applications including semiconductor analysis, biomedical imaging, and
              pharmaceutical research. Performance in these areas will assessed
              experimentally in Phase II. Finally, data analysis methods will be developed to
              extract chemical species information from the large, spatially resolved
              datasets involved.       Commercial sales of LCTF Raman imaging systems are
              estimated at $21M over the next 5 years, for research, semiconductor, diamond,
              pharmaceutical, and power generation industries.
