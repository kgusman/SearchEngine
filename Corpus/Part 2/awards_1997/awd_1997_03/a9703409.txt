Abstract    :
              Future  mobile  computing environments will  need to support  communication 
              intensive  applications  such  as Web  browsing,  multimedia  conferencing, 
              etc. This  requires  providing  sustained  quality of service  over  scarce 
              and shared wireless links. In the wireline domain, similar resource sharing 
              problems have led to the development of Integrated Services Packet Networks 
              (ISPN) that  support multiple  service classes for different  applications.  A
              similar  solution is  appropriate in the cellular packet network  domain, 
              particularly  because  application  demands  will be even  more varied, and 
              system  resources even  more stringent. Three concerns  are critical in our 
              environment: (a) applications  should be shielded  from underlying  network 
              dynamics  as much as  possible, (b) user mobility between  cells should  be 
              seamless, and (c) due to scarcity of resources, network utilization  should  be
              maximized. In this project, we propose to provide an Integrated Services 
              Cellular Packet Network (ISCN), which supports quality of service in mobile 
              computing environments.    There are three key ideas in our proposal: (a) we
              propose Adaptive Services,  which  provide  QoS  guarantees/assurances  within 
              bounds  and  support an  enhanced set of QoS parameters for wireless channel
              error and mobility; (b)  we propose new algorithms for  resource adaptation in
              order in increase the  network  utilization in the  presence of  mobility; and
              (c) we propose  new  algorithms for predictive  advance reservation in order to
              provide seamless  mobility for users across multiple cells in the ISCN.    For
