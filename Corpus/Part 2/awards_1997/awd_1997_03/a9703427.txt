Abstract    :
              9703427  Chrzan  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member.  The grant  is
              comprised of a research component integrated with an  educational component. 
              The goals of the award are to (1)  develop a detailed atomic and meso-scale
              understanding of  the mechanical properties of Ni3Al (and related materials); 
              (2) develop microstructure-based constitutive relationships  for these
              materials; (3) make computational materials  science more accessible to the
              typical materials scientist  through development and teaching of a
              computational  materials science "lab" course; and, (4) make the course and 
              codes widely available via the internet.  %%%  This is a CAREER award to a new
