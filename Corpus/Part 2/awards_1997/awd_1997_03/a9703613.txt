Abstract    :
              ***  9703613  Lewis  Chen  Schmidt    This award provides funding for the
              conduct of a three-year open workshop on decision- based design.  The workshop
              will be conducted via a series of face-to-face meetings, conducted three times
              per year, and with continuing interaction between all interested parties via
              electronic and Internet technologies throughout the three-year period. 
              Specifically, the workshop will include the development of a Web Page.  A
              primary component of the workshop will be the continual, open development and
              dissemination of the philosophical, theoretical, and practical results of the
              workshop discussions and activities.  The workshop will concentrate on a
              diversity of research efforts directed at the development of a theory of
              engineering design based on the emerging notion that engineering design is a
              process of decision making that is amenable to the myriad of tools and theories
              that have been developed in the field of decision theory over the past 200
              years.  If successful, this workshop will provide a new direction for research
              and education in engineering design.  New theoretical concepts should lead to
              approaches to engineering design that will enable the design of better
              products:  products that appeal more to their respective markets, cost less,
              have lower environmental impact, and which are more friendly for consumers in
              particular and society at large.  These concepts are likely to lead to entirely
              new approaches to engineering education, with a new focus on engineering design
              as a process of decision making.    ***
