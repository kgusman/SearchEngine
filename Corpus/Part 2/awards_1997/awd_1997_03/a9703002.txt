Abstract    :
              9703002  Kaszynski    This  project  will focus on the development of a  new 
              class  of  nematic   liquid   crystals   with  large   positive   dielectric 
              anisotropies   for   flat   panel  discplay   applications.   The  centerpiece 
              of  the synthetic design will be  the  highly  polar  boron-heteroatom bond,
              with the following issues to be addressed:  how  does  the formation of highly
              polar bonds to the boron  atom  and  the  resulting  high coaxial dipole 
              moments  influence  the  mesogenic  properties  and electrooptical performance 
              of  liquid  crystal  materials?;  how  does the geometry  of  boron  clusters 
              influence the mesophase stability and the miscibility with  other  liquid
              crystal materials?; how does the electronic structure of 3  dimensional  
              aromatic  boron  clusters  influence  the   optical  properties of the
              mesogens?  %%%  This well integrated research and education program combines in
              a  very unique way a theoretical and experimental exploration of the  basic  
              and   applied  chemistry  of  boron  and  nitrogen,   and  investigates  the 
              practical applications of these  materials  in  electrooptics for areas such as
              flat panel displays.  Integrating  these  current  high-priority materials
              research challenges  with  the  educational curriculum of this CAREER Program
              results in the  training  of  students  in  areas of  growing  relevancy 
              thereby  advancing  science and technology while improving  job  prospects  for
              students.  ***
