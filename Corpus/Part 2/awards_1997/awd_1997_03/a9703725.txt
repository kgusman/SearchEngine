Abstract    :
              This project will develop a systematic approach to integrating optimization
              algorithms, seismic reliability engineering and scio-economics for
              determination of target reliabilities and formulation of cost-effectiveness
              design and upgrading of earthquake-resistant reinforced concrete structures. 
              Cooperative research will be carried out at the University of Missouri-Rolla
              (UMR) and the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  The following tasks will
              be conducted at UCI. (1)  Approach for determination of optimal target
              reliability to revise and extend a platform for the systematic integration of
              the technical and scio-economic aspects of earthquake engineering: (2)
              Appraisal of current seismic criteria to examine the cost-effectiveness of
              specific existing criteria for earthquake-resistant design from the standpoint
              of minimum expected life-cycle cost; and (3) Critical examination and
              development of cost models to review and examine the available scio-economic
              models and information, including calibration and validation with recent
              earthquake damage data, and develop new or revised models for the proposal of
              reliability-based optimum design and upgrading of seismic resistant structures.
               At UMR the following five tasks will be considered.  (1) Development of
              multi-objective optimization with fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm for target
              reliability constraints; (2) Development of computer program with building code
              requirements such as UBC 1994 for optimum design and upgrading of reinforced
              concrete structures;  (3) Numerical studies of typical low-rise and high-rise
              office and apartment buildings for various seismic zones and target
              reliabilities; (4) Damage control of optimal-designed structures through
              nonlinear analysis; and (5) Assessment of design building code requirements and
              recommendations.  Through collaboration and integration the joint effort is
              expected to establish a systematic procedure for determining optimal target
              reliability or acceptable risk for the design or upgrading of a specific
              structure or class of structures; (2) advance optimization technique with
              multi-objective function, robust and global convergence, target reliability as
              well as minimum expected life-cycle costs; and (3) make recommendation of
              optimal building code requirements to the professional community and building
              code writers.
