Abstract    :
              9703609  Reagan     In this project, Micro-Pulse Lidar (MPL) measurements of
              aerosols will be carried out as part of the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment (ACE-2). ACE-2 will be conducted in June and July,
              1997, over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic Ocean as an international
              collaborative effort. The main objectives of ACE-2 are to study the properties
              of atmospheric aerosols relevant to radiative forcing and climate using
              aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements.   The principal objective
              of this work is to provide quantitative retrievals of aerosol spatial
              backscatter and extinction. Coupling MPL measurements with the comprehensive
              ACE-2 and AEROCE experiments represents an opportunity to enhance the aerosol
              information that will be derived at the Tenerife site. The MPL measurements
              will include standard vertical profililg plus horizontal and slant-path
              measurements, which are feasible since this system is eye-safe. The
              understanding of the temporal/spatial distributions of aerosols in the North
              Atlantic region that MPL measurements will provide is important to the
              development of a more accurate aerosol climatology. In addition to
              characterizing the aerosol spatial structure, the MPL extinction and
              backscatter retrievals provide optical coefficients that are a direct measure
              of aerosol radiative properties. Coupled with ground-based aerosol sampling and
              column direct solar/sky scan measurements, these retrievals will provide
              critical data for closure experiments to establish valid aerosol radiative
              models necessary to assess aerosol climate forcing effects.
