              OPP-9703565   BORYS, RANDOLPH  UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA    This research project is
              a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface
              Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program will be
              conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These
              investigators will measure near-surface atmospheric conditions of the region
              from the cloud base to the surface of the permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean
              using an instumented research balloon during a period from Spring to Fall.  The
              research will be conducted in conjunction with a DOE Atmospheric Radiation
              Measurement research program jointly conducted at the site. These researchers
              will determine the vertical profile of temperature and humidity as a function
              of changing cloud conditions. Their results will help determine how atmospheric
              heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These measurements are
              critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it
              melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal
              variations in climate, especially changing cloud conditions. The balloon
              measurement program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of
              researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of
              instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above, as well as ice and ocean
              property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of
              measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic
              region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate
              and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that
              could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present
              levels.
