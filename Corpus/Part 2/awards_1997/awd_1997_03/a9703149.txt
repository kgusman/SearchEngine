Abstract    :
              The  objective  of this research is to develop and experimentally  test  new
              methodologies for task scheduling, action planning  and  control   of   robotic
               and  manufacturing  systems.    The   new  methodologies  will be a
              combination of heuristic and  analytical  approaches  and based on a direct
              algorithmic connection  between  simple  on-line  perception of not fully 
              predictable  geometric,  dynamic  and time events, and the desired actions of 
              robotic  or  manufacturing systems.  They will provide a robust  and  reliable 
              method for handling local geometric and dynamic uncertainties  as  well  as 
              coping  with  unexpected  events,  so  that  the  local  disturbances do not
              become global ones causing the need  for  re-  planning the operation.  This
              development  will help to eliminate  or   lessen  some  of  the  down-time  of 
              automated  robotic  or  manufacturing systems caused by inflexible scheduling, 
              planning,  sensing  and control methods.  It will also help to substantially 
              reduce  the  fixturing  or  set-up  requirements  of  robotic  or 
              manufacturing systems.  As an integral part of the research,  the  education 
              activities include developing a Robotics Collaboratory  Environment  (RCE)  
              which will provide a new instruction  method  and  laboratory environment for
              teaching robotics,  manufacturing  automation  and intelligent systems. As a
              result,  more  students  from  groups  that  have been traditionally 
              underrepresented  in  science  and  engineering can be involved, and more
              opportunities  for  undergraduate  students to incorporate  research 
              activities  into their course work will be provided.
