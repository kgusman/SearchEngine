Abstract    :
              9760753  Mancevski   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              addresses research to demonstrate the feasibility of a new generation of Six
              Degree-of-Freedom (Six-DOF) Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tools for use in
              microelectronics manufacturing that overcome limitations inherent in the
              sensing and control system architectures of existing lower degree-of-freedom
              AFMs.  This will be achieved by merging elements of current AFM technology with
              a Six-DOF sensing system invented and patented by the University of
              Texas-Austin.  This Six-DOF sensing system is capable of measuring all six
              absolute degrees of freedom of a body of space, such as a deflecting AFM
              cantilever.  XIDEX calls the resulting new generation of tools "6D-AFM" tools. 
              6D-AFMs will be used for material characterization, chemical-mechanical
              planarization monitoring, precision surface profiling and critical dimension
              metrology.  The sensing system of a 6D-AFM will be completely decoupled from
              the actuator, enabling it to measure at even better resolutions than the
              actuator itself, and do so while the actuator is in motion.   XIDEX will
              develop, manufacture and sell 6D-AFM tools to the semiconductor industry for
              material characterization, critical dimension metrology, and precision surface
              profiling and to other attractive market segments and niches such as
              lithography, biological sampling, and nanoprobe research instrumentation.
