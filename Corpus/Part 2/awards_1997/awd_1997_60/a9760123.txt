Abstract    :
              ***  9760123  Cameron    Over the past two decades, the world abalone market has
              suffered from a significant decline in supply.  This is due primarily to
              over-fishing of wild abalone.  Farm reared abalone have not yet been produced
              in sufficient quantity to fill this void in the world market.  Significant
              effort is being devoted to the development of cost-effective abalone
              cultivation systems.  The limited availability of suitable seaweed as abalone
              food has been identified as one of the main impediments to farming of abalone. 
              It is the problem of food availability that Big Island Abalone Corporation
              proposes to address in this feasibility test of it's proprietary design for a
              low maintenance, land-based, modular abalone and macro-algae polyculture
              grow-out system.    The primary focus of the proposed research will be to
              determine the maximum sustainable production of a macro alga, Palmaria mollis,
              to be used as abalone food, under the unique parameters that comprise the
              aquaculture environment at the Natural Energy Laboratory Hawaii Authority at
              Keahole Point, Hi.  The ability to grow dulse in sufficient quantity to sustain
              commercial production of abalone is pivotal for the success of BIAC's efforts
              at commercial abalone farming.    The demand for abalone, as a result of the
              precipitous declines in world-wide Catch, is at an all time high.  The FAO has
              estimated the world catch of abalone in 1968 at 28,000 metric tons, and only
              13,000 metric tons in 1995.  With this plunge in wild catch of abalone has come
              significant increases in price at all market levels.  Again in 1968, abalone
              landed in California sold for about $95.00 a dozen.  While today wild caught
              abalone in California are selling for about $600.00 a dozen.  The market for
              abalone, while world-wide in scope, is not one market but actually two.  The
              largest segment and somewhat independent from the smaller, is in Asia (Japan,
              China, Hong Kong, Korea & Taiwan).  The smaller market segment includes the
              United States, Canada, Mexico, En gland, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, France,
              South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, with emerging interest in Chile. 
              From it's mid-Pacific base Big Island Abalone is strategically placed to sell
              abalone in all Pacific Rim markets.  ***
