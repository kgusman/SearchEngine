Abstract    :
              ***  9760265  Hollo    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is aimed at development of in-process femtosecond energy diffusion sensing of
              microscale thermal transfer to control thin film vapor deposition processes. 
              Recent advances in laser technology and the development of microscale heat
              transfer models have made it possible to use ultrashort laser pulses to measure
              the thermal conductivity, elastic modulus and thickness of thin films. Phase I
              will investigate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of developing an
              industrial version of a femtosecond energy diffusion sensor for in-process
              measurement of critical material properties during vapor deposition of thin
              films.  Measurements will be made on thin films produced by chemical vapor
              deposition, sputtering, electron beam evaporation and plasma deposition. 
              Micro-scale thermal transport models will be used to correlate the measurements
              to material properties such as thermal conductivity, elastic modulus, defect
              concentration, grain size and film composition..    Feedback control of vapor
              deposition processes is critical to the cost-effective manufacture of advanced
              thin film materials such as high-temperature superconductors, advanced
              photovoltaic cells and thermal barrier coatings.  An industrial version
              femtosecond energy diffusion sensor has the capability to provide required in
              process measurements for closed-loop of a wide variety of vapor deposition
              processes.  ***
