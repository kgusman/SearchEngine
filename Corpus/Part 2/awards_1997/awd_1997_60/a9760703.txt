Abstract    :
              ***  9760703  Hodko    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              describes the development of an innovative approach for decontamination of
              soils and wastes polluted by heavy metals.  Heavy metal contamination presents
              one of the most intractable problems for soil clean-up.  Present technology
              relies mostly upon ex situ metal extraction or in situ contaminant
              immobilization processes, which are expensive and which remove all biological
              activity in the soil during the soil treatment.  Recently, the use of
              metal-accumulating plants was explored for the removal of metals from
              contaminated soils.  This new phytoremediation technology utilizes specially
              selected or engineered metal accumulating plants or plants native to
              metalliferous soils with a capacity to bioaccumulate metals to concentrations
              greater than 2% in the aerial plant dry matter.  However, the use of this
              technology is limited to superficially-contaminated soils, which is determined
              by the plant root length and plant suction potential.  Lynntech, Inc. proposes
              a development of an innovative approach to phytoremediation, which will
              significantly enhance the process of phytoextraction and extend its application
              to soils with deep subsurface contamination.  The approach involves a process
              which allows an upward, counter-gravitational transport of contaminants, water,
              as well as nutrients through the soil matrix to the rhizosphere.  Once the
              contaminants are transported to the rhizosphere they will be extracted by
              contaminant-accumulating plants which can concentrate contaminants from the
              soil into the harvestable parts of roots and above-ground shoots.    Potential
              Commercial Applications of the Research: The development of this technology, if
              shown to be successful, will have a large potential commercial applications:
              (i) in remediation of mixed waste polluted soils (heavy metals, organics and
              radionuclides); (ii) in agriculture for remediation of sewage sludge amended
              soils and for removal of pesticides and other toxins fr om the rhizosphere
              zone, and (iii) as an innovative practice for nutrient and moisture transport
              and containment in dry soils.  ***
