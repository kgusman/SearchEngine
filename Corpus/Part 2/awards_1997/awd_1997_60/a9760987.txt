Abstract    :
              ***  9760987    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for
              the construction of a low voltage SEM which uses a magnetic dipole lens as the
              objective lens.  The theoretical performance of  this design is far superior to
              any lens in current use.  The lens consists of a permanently magnetized sphere.
               New materials are now available which make it feasible to use spheres of  only
              a few mm in diameter and yet achieve a resolution superior to anything
              commercially   available. Using this concept, we are in a position to fabricate
              SEMs which are lower in cost and higher in performance than any other
              instruments.    The completed microscope will be used at research and
              development facilities for the imaging of biological specimens at high
              resolution.  The microscope will also be extremely valuable for semiconductor
              chip inspection.  ***
