Abstract    :
              ***  9760593  Zimmer    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              will explore superplastic forming in composite materials, which are not
              normally deformable.  It is a hot deformation process which requires extensive
              tensile elongations.  In contrast to conventional superplasticity, which relies
              on a stable fine-grained microstructure, superplasticity in composites arises
              from internal stresses generated by the volumetric mismatch between a
              transforming (allotropic) matrix material and a stable, non-transforming second
              phase.  Termed Transformation Mismatch Superplastitity (TMS), the new process
              uses thermal cycling to attain elongations of more than 200%. Titanium metal
              matrix (MMC) composites, reinforced with titanium carbide (TiC) and boride
              (TiB) particulate manufactured by powder metallurgy, are commercial because of
              improved elevated temperature strength, elastic modulus, and wear-resistance. 
              Phase I will develop methods of rapid thermal cycling and test the superplastic
              forming limits of titanium-alloy MMCs reinforced with TiB and TiC particulate.
              Phase II would develop a viable manufacturing process for ceertain aerospace
              and commercial components.         Commercial applications would involve
              fabricating tubular shapes - both circular and box tubing - by superplastically
              forming a final size and shape from a powder metallurgy near-net shape hollow
              preform.  This technology could find use in manufacturing hot gas ducting for
              aircraft, in automotive exhaust, in stiffened structural tubing, in sporting
              and recreational goods (golf club heads, lacrosse sticks, and bicycle frames),
              in corrosion/erosion resistant reaction vessels, and in tubing and fittings for
              paper making, chemical processing, and seawater service.  ***
