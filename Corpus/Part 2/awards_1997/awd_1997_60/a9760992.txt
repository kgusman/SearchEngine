Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Dimension
              Technologies, Inc. (DTI) will determine the feasibility of a desktop
              autostereoscopic (3D without glasses) rear projection display.  This proposed
              display would offer freedom of observer movement, hologram-like look-around,
              and multiple observer viewing of large, full color, high resolution images.  It
              will use a fast ICFLCD or DLP light valve along with other off-the-shelf
              optical and lighting components.  The project will concentrate on three main
              objectives: construction of a fully functional bench model; characterization of
              the model by means of psychophysical tests and optical measurements; and the
              definition of requirements and features of an engineering prototype to be built
              in the next phase of the research for the purpose of developing commercial
              products for scientific visualization.  A display of this type would
              significantly enhance existing advanced simulation capabilities by presenting
              complex representations of data and simulated phenomena in a natural, easy to
              see and interpret 3D format that can be viewed by several people simultaneously
              without encumbering glasses or headgear.  Desktop autostereoscopic displays of
              the type proposed could find widespread use as visualization tools in areas
              where stereoscopic displays are already known to be of benefit.  These include
              such applications as chemistry, geology, mathematics, medical imaging, CAD, and
              architecture.  Partnering with a firm that is a current DTI display user and is
              a potential customer for this proposed desktop autostereoscopic displays should
              lead to rapid commercialization.
