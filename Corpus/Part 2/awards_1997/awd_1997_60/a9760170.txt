Abstract    :
              ***  9760170  Lockert    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              will develop a mechanically reinforced Commingled Recycled Plastic Lumber
              (CRPL) with an efficient cross-sectional geometry.  Reinforcements include
              chopped natural fibers and continuous synthetic fibers oriented both
              isotropicly and anistropicly.  Efficient cross-sections are used to maximize
              geometric stiffness while minimizing material requirements.  CRPL's inherent
              long life expectancy augmented by significant increases in mechanical
              properties would allow this innovative product to cost effectively replace wood
              in civil infrastructure projects.  The research has strongly interactive
              process development, experimental, and computational (finite element)
              components.  The latter provides a "mechanics of reinforced plastics approach"
              in specifying reinforcements and optimal profiles.  Process flexibility allows
              the hybrid profile to be designed for the application as opposed to finding an
              application meeting the product's capabilities.    CRPL's superior
              bio-degradation resistance provides a wide range of potential commercial
              applications including where pressure-treated wood is currently used. 
              Applications include residential and commercial construction, e.g., building
              framing, fence and sign posts, guard rail posts, retaining walls, bulkheads,
              pilings, pallets, railroad ties, concrete forms, etc.  If the research is
              successful, the potential for intelligent use of reinforcement and optimal
              structural profiles should result in mechanical performance and service life of
              CRPL far superior to wood in many civil infrastructure projects.
