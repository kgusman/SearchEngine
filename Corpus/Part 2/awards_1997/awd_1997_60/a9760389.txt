Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project submitted by CyberScan
              Technologies Company provides an affordable means of electronically enhancing
              the nation's large installed chalk boards, white boards, and drawing board
              base.  By adapting conventional writing surfaces rather than replacing them
              with expensive electronic white boards or graphics tablets, academic
              institutions, corporations, and governments could save approximately $5 billion
              in new equipment and installation costs.  CyberScan Technologies proposes to
              develop a retrofittable, low cost, area adaptive system that can optically
              capture notes, drawings or sketches to a computer or the Internet.  CyberScan
              will research the feasibility of digitizing hand strokes in real time using two
              small optical sensors and an optically transmitting pen or chalk holder. 
              CyberScan anticipates this technique could convert written information on
              surfaces from one to twelve feet in diagonal into electronic data suitable for
              display on a PC SVGA display screen.  Potential commercial applications of the
              research include: CAD/CAM digitizers, low cost and portable electronic white
              board alternatives, video conferencing input devices, medical patient charting,
              and academic, corporate, military, and government interactive presentation
              devices.  Because of the serious interest of a potential marketing partner in
              the electronic white board field, rapid commercialization of products is
              extremely likely.
