Abstract    :
              ***  9760847  Huang    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes to develop processing techniques for the synthesis of  transition
              metal carbonitride aerogel materials for energy storage applications. Aerogels
              are a class of low density foam materials characterized by open cell structures
              composed of particles usually less than 10 nanometers in diameter with pore
              sizes usually less than 50 nanometers in diameter.  It is well known that
              nanostructural aerogel materials prepared by the sol-gel process exhibit very
              high porosity and surface areas.  Moreover, pore structures and pore sizes can
              be tailored with this process.    Ultracapacitors are capacitive energy storage
              devices based on double-layer capacitance. The potential power density and
              cycle life of electrochemical capacitors are two orders of magnitude higher
              than those of rechargeable batteries. A wide range of potential applications
              have been identified.  The extremely low density and high surface area metal
              carbonitride aerogels have potential as electrode materials for long-cycle
              life, high energy and high power densities ultracapacitors.    Potential
              applications include power sources for automotive subsystems, load leveling for
              electric vehicles, and power supplies for medical devices and portable
              electronic equipment. Other potential applications of aerogels include thermal
              super-insulation, catalysts and catalyst supports, gas filters and gas storage
              materials,  and acoustic insulation.  ***
