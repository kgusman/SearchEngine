Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research (Sbir) Phase I project will develop a
              layer-by-layer method to manufacture electric motors that are exceptionally
              efficient and compact.  In conventional motors, the magnetic field is produced
              by current flowing through coils of insulated wire placed in slots punched in
              low silicon steel laminations.  Phase I would eliminate wire and improve the
              magnetic efficiency of the laminations.  Conductors and their insulators will
              be built up in layers using a computer-controlled laser to produce ceramic
              insulators and fused powder metal conductors.  Techniques to increase the
              silicon content of the laminations and reduce their losses will be developed. 
              Compared to conventional motors, this technique would reduce core losses by a
              factor of three, winding losses by a factor of 2.5, and reduce energy
              consumption by 2.5-5% through greatly increased thermal conductivity.  In
              addition to motors, this technology may be applied to generators, transformers,
              and similar devices.  Where size, weight, and efficiency are important,
              applications include: traction motors for electric cars, compact automobile
              motors and generators, lightweight motors for aircraft and space vehicles, and
              high power motors for machine tools.
