   STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS AND MODELING IN FINANCIAL MATHEMATICS

              Research is proposed on various open mathematical problems of stochastic

              analysis and control, which arise in the context of the modern theory for 

              financial markets. Most of these problems are formulated in the 
 context of a
              continuous-time model for a market with one riskless 
 and several risky
              securities, and involve 
  (i) questions of single-agent optimization,
              multi-agent equilibrium,
 hedging and pricing of contingent claims in markets
              with prices that
 can depend on the investment strategy of a "large
              investor";
  (ii)  optimization, least expensive hedging, and  pricing, in
              markets
 with  transaction costs;
  (iii) questions of fair pricing in
              arbitrary incomplete markets,
 including markets with portfolio constraints;

               (iv)  maximization of the  probability of hedging, in various models;
  (v) 
              study of new, game-type options;
  (vi) dynamic measures of risk;
  (vii)
              stationary equilibrium in strategic market games;
  (viii) related questions
              of stochastic analysis such as  existence and
 uniqueness of certain
              Forward-Backward  Stochastic Differential Equations,
 existence and uniqueness
              of viscosity solutions to certain PDE's and
 variational inequalities, solving
               non-standard stochastic control problems
 where the loss function has a
              random component.
 It is expected that known tools from stochastic analysis
              and martingale
 theory, convex duality theory, functional analysis, stochastic
              control
 and viscosity solutions to partial differential equations and
              variational
 inequalities, will prove valuable in the resolution of these
              questions,
 but also that new tools will have to be developed to solve
              nonstandard
 problems that arise. Thus, the project should result in the
              advancement
 of the understanding of both the theoretical and applied aspects
              of these
 fields.
 
 The significance of the proposed research is related to
              the fact that
 one of the main gaps between theory and practice of financial
              markets
 is the prevailing assumption in most of the models that the markets
              are
 perfect, implying that every financial contract can be priced in a
              unique
 way, and its risk can, in principle be fully controlled (hedged).
 In
              reality, however, this is not the case; markets are "imperfect" or 

              "incomplete" due, among other things, to investment constraints, transaction 

              costs, different interest rates for borrowing and lending, different
 patterns
              of information, presence of "large" or "informed"  investors
 who can 
              influence  prices, etc. Thus, it is  very important to develop
 new methods
              for studying the risks and the ways of pricing financial
 instruments in
              imperfect markets, some of which are suggested in this
 proposal. In
              particular, these methods should prove useful in  newly
 developing markets
              such as re-insurance, catastrophic insurance, energy
 derivatives, credit-risk
              derivatives and other insufficiently liquid markets.
