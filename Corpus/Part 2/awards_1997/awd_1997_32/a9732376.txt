Abstract    :
              This project deals with the design of computational algorithms  that blend
              together the practical virtues of efficiency and  numerical accuracy for matrix
              problems with structure.  The two  requirements of speed and accuracy have
              often been regarded as  competitive and, for this reason, the design of fast
              and  numerically reliable algorithms for large-scale structured linear  matrix
              equations has remained a significant open issue in many  instances.   
              Structured matrix equations arise in several applications in the  disciplines
              of filtering, estimation, and control.  In this way,  the results of the
              proposed work will further play a concrete  role in addressing some of the
              annoying discrepancies that have  always existed in these areas between the
              theoretical findings  and the practical results.  These discrepancies are often
              due to  the pitfalls of finite-precision implementations, especially in 
              systems that involve interconnections of digital and analog  components, and
              studies to resolve or ameliorate many of these  difficulties have long been
              overdue.    This investigation will address the challenge of combining 
              numerical accuracy and structure exploiting techniques into a  unifying
              framework.  The project will build on the work recently  done, will extend the
              results and the framework to a wider  class of structured matrix problems, and
              will explore  applications in filtering, estimation and control.
