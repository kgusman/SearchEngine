Abstract    :
              9732848   Kovacevic   As research into 3-D welding continues, the ability to
              produce fully dense, structurally strong metal parts directly from 3-D CAD data
              comes nearer to reality. This project will lay the foundation for developing a
              technique of controlling the dimensional accuracy of parts obtained by 3-D
              welding, one of the newest rapid prototyping methods.    In 3-D welding, a
              droplet of the melted electrode wire is detached to form a metallic deposit.
              Rapid prototyping or rapid manufacturing may be accomplished by controlled
              deposition of the drops. A metallic part can be made layer by layer, with the
              drop size and detachment timing defining the resultant shape of the part, as
              well as its mechanical and metallurgical properties. The proposed system for
              rapid prototyping based on 3-D welding addresses the challenge of simultaneous
              geometric regulation of dimensional tolerances and mechanical and metallurgical
              properties of the part, by combined heat and mass transfer control. 3-D welding
              has the potential of offering numerous advantages over other rapid prototyping
              techniques. Final parts may be constructed with a large variation in dimensions
              and geometry by the introduction of robotic control of the welding torch. 3-D
              welding would allow the direct production of parts made of different materials.
              It is projected that the very low operating cost, the rapid processing time,
              and the control of properties makes 3-D welding unique among current rapid
              prototyping techniques. The combination of the theoretical and experimental
              approach will provide better understanding of the physics and the basis to
              optimize this innovative technique.
