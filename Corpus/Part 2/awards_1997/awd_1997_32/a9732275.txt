Abstract    :
              9732275  The Eastern Illinois University (EIU) Zoology Department  will provide
              intensive research experiences for 9  undergraduate students during the summers
              of 1998 and 1999.  Student participants will form research teams to engage in 
              studies addressing conservation biology and landscape  fragmentation. The goals
              of this experience will be to  foster in each participant an understanding of
              the research  process, and encourage each student's growth from dependent 
              learner to independent researcher to interdependent member  of a scientific
              team.  Participants will be recruited  nationally and selected based on their
              professional goals,  motivation and maturity, and academic achievements. 
              Students will be fully immersed in the research process as  they choose their
              own research problem, write a proposal,  conduct the work, and report their
              results and conclusions.  Each participant will work closely with an individual
               faculty mentor and team members. Opportunities to interact  and collaborate
              with other faculty members and research  teams will be provided through an
              orientation retreat,  weekly group meetings, and a series of formal workshops
              and  field trips.  In addition, visiting scientists, recognized  leaders in
              conservation biology, will each spend 1 or 2 days  presenting seminars,
              participating in informal discussion  groups, and critiquing research projects.
               Students will  have ample opportunities to interact with mentors, fellow 
              participants, and visiting scientists in both formal and  informal settings. 
              EIU is strongly committed to  undergraduate research and will make important
              contributions  to this program, including provision of a block of dormitory 
              rooms and a common dining area for participants, waiver of  tuition for three
              credit-hours, and free use of campus  facilities, including the library,
              computer labs, and  recreation center.
