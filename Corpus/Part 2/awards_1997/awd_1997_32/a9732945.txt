Abstract    :
              Brian Space is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of   condensed
              phase conduction and spectroscopic processes.  This research   program focuses
              on the theoretical investigation of condensed phase and   interfacial
              phenomena.  The research is concentrated in two areas: 1) the   investigation
              of electronic localization and conduction behaviors at   metal-dielectric
              interfaces; and 2) the continued development of   instantaneous normal mode
              theories to better understand the information   contained in liquid state
              spectra.  Space will also integrate his   research and teaching efforts by
              introducing computer simulation into the   undergraduate Physical Chemistry
              curriculum at Duquesne University.    Instantaneous normal mode methods are
              rapidly emerging as a powerful new   tool for understanding the complex
              behavior of condensed phase systems.    They are providing new molecular
              insights into the interpretation of   experimental spectroscopic data and other
              materials properties
