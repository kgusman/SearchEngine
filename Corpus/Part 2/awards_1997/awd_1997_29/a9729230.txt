Abstract    :
              This project is designed to continue the work done at Wheelock College under the
              National Science Foundation funded Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher
              Preparation, Teacher Education Addressing Mathematics and Science in Boston and
              Cambridge (TEAMS-BC) to improve mathematics and science education of students
              preparing to teach young children in the elementary schools. Over the past
              three years, with the support of TEAMS-BC, Wheelock has used six strategies to
              reform its mathematics and science programs:    The enhancement of the basic
              courses in curriculum development with additional mathematics and science
              elements;    The development of new mathematics and science courses and the
              revision of existing core courses that meet the distribution requirements to
              reflect an approach to the teaching of science and mathematics that emphasizes
              the acquisition of basic concepts in science and mathematics and inquiry and
              problem solving skills and models effective teaching for understanding;    The
              development, revision, and extension of courses in science and mathematics
              education (methods courses) so that they relate more closely to the mathematics
              and science courses and to reflect more clearly and deeply the nature and
              strategies of teaching for understanding;    The enhancement of the
              Mathematics/Science Major and intensification of recruitment activities;    The
              development of a mathematics and science specialty for students wishing to
              pursue mathematics and science in greater depth; and    The provision of
              opportunities for faculty and mentor teachers to work together to enhance their
              skills in science and mathematics teaching and mentoring.  In this proposal,
              funds are requested to: (1) further develop and finalize science and
              mathematics courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels which were revised
              and/or introduced during the first three years of TEAMS-BC; (2) complete the
              revision of the initial mathematics course sequence for Wheelock
              undergraduates; (3) continue the development of tw o new programs at Wheelock
              focusing on mathematics and science education (Specialty in Teaching
              Mathematics and Science, Certificate in Teaching Mathematics); (4) continue to
              collaborate with cooperating teachers on mentoring and science and mathematics
              teaching at three professional development sites - the Holmes School and the
              Young Achievers School in Boston and the King School in Cambridge; and (5)
              prepare portfolios of key courses for dissemination within the college and to
              other institutions.
