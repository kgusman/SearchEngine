Abstract    :
              It is essential to societies that their children become competent adults. To
              facilitate the development of competence, it is important to understand the
              processes that drive successful development and transitions to adult life. This
              study has the goal of contributing to the fundamental knowledge needed for
              building theory, designing policies, and guiding programs focused on promoting
              successful pathways to competence, particularly for individuals who grow up
              with adversity. Understanding resilience, how children overcome risks and
              negative life experience to become competent, is particularly important in our
              time because many American children are growing up in hazardous situations.
              This project is a 20-year follow-up of a school sample of 205 urban children
              and their families who joined `Project Competence` in 1978 and 1979 when they
              were in elementary school. They were followed up 7 and 10 years later.
              Extensive data are available on the development and life histories of these
              children through adolescence. In this new follow-up, the cohort will be
              contacted again to assess their adult success in multiple domains of competence
              from multiple informants, including the young adults themselves, parents,
              peers, and employers. These data will make it possible to identify the
              predictors of adult success in life for children and adolescents who have faced
              great hardship and to test hypotheses that adult competence in work, family and
              community roles has roots earlier in development and that children with good
              social capital will weather adversity, become competent adults and providers of
              social capital for society and the next generation. This study will enhance our
              understanding of the risk and protective factors that jeopardize and promote
              the development of social competence from childhood to adulthood. Results could
              inform efforts to foster resilience in children and youth at risk due to
              psychosocial disadvantage or adversity.
