Abstract    :
                This project will examine the effects of neighborhood characteristics on
              adolescents' school completion and educational attainment, sexual activity and
              non-marital childbearing, and delinquency and drug use. The theoretical
              framework is grounded most heavily in William J. Wilson's treatise dealing with
              the impact of neighborhood disadvantage on inner-city social dislocations. The
              primary explanatory variables will include indicators of the socioeconomic and
              demographic status of the adolescent's neighborhood, such as the poverty rate,
              the unemployment rate, racial composition, and mate availability. Special
              attention will be given to the functional form of the relationship between
              neighborhood economic disadvantage and these behaviors; the potentially
              differential impact of neighborhood characteristics across different
              socioeconomic, age, and racial groups; factors such as parental supervision,
              educational and occupational aspirations, and peer group norms, that might
              mediate the effects of neighborhood conditions on adolescent outcomes; and the
              degree to which differences in the socioeconomic and demographic composition of
              the neighborhoods inhabited by blacks and whites can explain the often
              pronounced racial differences in educational attainment, premarital sexual
              activity, and non-marital fertility. The analysis of this unique, multi-level
              data set holds promise for refining theoretical models of how neighborhoods
              affect life events and life chances, for testing recent claims regarding the
              increasing concentration of disadvantaged groups in underclass areas, and for
              informing public policies that address these issues.
