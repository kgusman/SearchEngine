Abstract    :
              The Dictionary of American Regional English, official dictionary  of the
              American Dialect Society, treats both regional and social  variation among
              speakers of American English. Based on an  extensive program of contemporary
              (1965-70) fieldwork in 1,002  communities across the U. S., and an equally
              extensive collection  of written sources from the seventeenth century through
              the  present, DARE includes words, phrases, and pronunciations that  vary from
              one part of the country to another or from one social  group to another. The
              Dictionary provides full historical  treatment, with pronunciations, variant
              forms, etymologies,  regional labels, social and usage labels, definitions,
              dated  quotations, and cross-references, as appropriate. A unique  feature of
              DARE is the inclusion (within the text) of maps  showing the regional
              distribution of words, phrases, and forms.  Volume I, containing introductory
              matter and the letters A-C, was  published in 1985 to the acclaim of scholars,
              reviewers, and the  public as well. Volume II (D-H) was published in 1991, and
              Volume  III (I-O) in 1996. Two more volumes will complete the dictionary 
              itself, and a final volume will contain a supplement, a complete  list of all
              responses to the Questionnaire, a bibliography of all  sources quoted, a
              section of maps showing regional contrasts and  social distributions, and a
              cumulative index of the regional,  social, and etymological labels used in the
              text. DARE will not  only provide a full record of regional American English,
              but will  also furnish, both in the Dictionary text and in the raw  materials,
              the resources to stimulate much further linguistic  research.
