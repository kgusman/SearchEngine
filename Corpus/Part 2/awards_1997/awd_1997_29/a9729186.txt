Abstract    :
              9729186  Dunn    This project entitled Synthesis and Properties of Continuous 
              Periodic Mesoporous Films focuses on the use of ordered arrays  of surfactant
              molecules as templetes for the three-dimensional  polymerization of silicates.
              Thin films of centimeter dimensions  form rapidly by a continuous process on
              solid substrates. The  program consists of three complimentary objectives: to 
              synthesize new mesoporous films, to understand the process of  film formation,
              and to design nanomaterials templated by the  mesophase structure to produce
              metal and semiconductor quantum  dots and one dimensional wires in ordered
              arrays within the  silica film.  %%%  This project will focus on the prospects
              for creating mesoporous  films with unique electrical and optical properties.
              The  mesoporous substrates for quantum dot arrays provides an  interesting
              approach to growing semiconductor nanostructures.  The microstructure of
              mesoporous films offers the possibility of  incorporating metals and
              semiconductors to generate periodic  arrays of quantum dots or one-dimensional
              wires, and of  exploring new types of self-assembled optical waveguides. The 
              outcome of this research will be nanostructured films possessing  interesting
              electrical, optical, and catalytic properties.  ***
