Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9729569  M. Rubner/MIT    The objective of this research is to
              establish the fundamental knowledge base needed to control the structure and
              properties if sequentially adsorbed polyion layers and to use this knowledge to
              create high performance light emitting thin film devices and versatile surface
              modification layers.  The program will explore in detail the role that
              processing parameters play in determining the structure, organization, layer
              thickness and properties of multilayer thin films fabricated from sequentially
              adsorbed bilayers of weak polyacids and strong polycations.  Important issues
              such as determining and controlling the level of interlayer interlayer
              interpenetration and the polyanion/polycation composition of the internal
              bilayers and outermost surface layer will be examined including non-conjugated
              and conjugated polyions and light emitting polyions.  It is anticipated that
              the fundamental knowledge gained by these new studies will make it possible to
              significantly enhance the performance of thin film light emitting devices
              fabricated from conjugated polyions and to create a new facility of surface
              modification layers suitable for applications ranging from anti-fogging
              surfaces to contact lenses.  Light emitting thin film devices will be examined
              with the goal of creating large area, high efficiency devices.  ***
