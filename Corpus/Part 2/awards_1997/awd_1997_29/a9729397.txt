Abstract    :
                Brown   9729397  The subgroup lII geminiviruses (Geminiviridae) are
              transmitted by a single species of whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in a persistent,
              circulative fashion. The transmission pathway requires that virions, taken up
              during insect feeding along with plant sap, enter the insect gut and cross the
              hindgut epithelium into the hemocoel. Virions then pass through the hemocoel in
              the hemolymph, and must traverse both the basal lamina and plasmalemma of the
              accessory salivary gland secretory cells to reach the salivary canal.
              Transmission to the host plant phloem occurs through saliva delivered by the
              stylet. This complex journey through the vector demands that virions be taken
              up and released by insect cells, and that several transmission barters be
              crossed. Each of these barriers involves a specific interaction between vital
              coat protein (CP) and whitefly proteins (transmission factors/receptors). At
              this time, CP sequences that participate in key recognition events have not
              been identified, and there is no information concerning whitefly proteins
              involved in transmission. To address these questions, a powerful combination of
              molecular biology, biochemistry, and yeast genetics will be employed. In
              addition, a novel and sensitive PCR-based bioassay for monitoring virus
              acquisition and transmission by the whitefly will be used.  The specific
              objectives of this research are:    1. To identify specific amino acids in
              geminivirus CP that are necessary for whitefly-mediated transmission. These
              studies will employ the transmissible squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV) and the
              non-transmissible Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV). Defined sequence exchanges and
              amino acid substitutions will be introduced into the AbMV CP gene in an effort
              to restore transmissibility (gain of function), and into the SqLCV CP gene to
              abolish transmissibility (loss of function). These experiments should identify
              CP amino acids involved in transmission, and in particular those responsible
              for the loss of AbMV transmissibility.    2.  To identify whitefly-encoded
              cDNAs specifying proteins which interact with geminivirus CP to potentiate
              virus acquisition and transmission. The yeast two-hybrid system and expression
              cloning in COS cells will be used to identify cDNAs encoding whitefly proteins
              capable of interacting with geminivirus CP. Genetic analysis will be carried
              out to identify CP domains involved in specific whitefly protein interactions,
              and to examine the relevance of the interactions to transmission.
              Immunolocalization of interacting whitefly proteins will also be performed as a
              prelude to functional analysis.    The whitefly-transmitted (WFT) geminiviruses
              (Geminiviridae; subgroup III) are important pathogens of vegetable and fiber
              crops. The dissemination of these pathogens through agoecosystems depends on
              three interacting components: the geminivirus pathogen, the whitefly vector,
              and plant species that serve as hosts for both the virus and the vector. In
              this project experiments are described which are designed to extend the current
              understanding of the molecular mechanisms of transmission, and the molecular
              basis of transmission specificity. Defining the molecular mechanisms of
              geminivirus transmission by whiteflies has broad implications for understanding
              the interactions that occur between biological vectors and vector-borne
              pathogens of animals and plants, which in most cases are poorly studied.
