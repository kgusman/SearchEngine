Abstract    :
                     Funds are requested from the NSF to assist in the  purchase of a 500 MHz
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  console and two probes. The requested console
              will replace an  existing Varian VXR-500 console (made in 1987) and will be 
              located in the recently expanded Department of Chemistry's  Instrumentation
              Facility (DCIF). The addition of a modern 500  MHz NMR console is an integral
              part of a major initiative,  including a $540,000 renovation, which is already
              underway to  upgrade and modernize the multi-user DCIF at the  Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology. The new capabilities  provided by a 500 MHz NMR
              instrument with three rf channels  and pulsed field gradients are vital for the
              carrying out of  biologically-related research in the Department. Projects 
              that will benefit from the acquisition of a high-field NMR  instrument fall
              into the following general categories: (1)  investigations of drug-DNA
              interactions; (2) design of drugs  that selectively inactivate tumor cells; (3)
              development of a  chemical understanding of the basis for helicity in proteins;
               and (4) NMR studies of small proteins.       At present, the two 500 MHz NMR
              consoles in the DCIF are  more than 10 years old. The lack of modern,
              high-field NMR  instrumentation requires Departmental researchers with a need 
              for state-of-the-art NMR technology to obtain time at  regional facilities and
              negatively impacts productivity.  Biological research being carried out in the
              Department would  be greatly facilitated by a 500 MHz NMR console with 
              increased sensitivity, better shims, digital filtering,  pulsed-field
              gradients, selective excitation, and triple  resonance.
