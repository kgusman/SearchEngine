Abstract    :
              This one-year planning project explores a new approach to ecosystem valuation by
              developing a multi-criteria system of environmental valuation for use within
              locally based ecosystem management processes.  Emphasis will be on three
              objectives: (1) to refine the theoretical aspects of a proposed multi-criteria,
              dynamic, and place-based approach to environmental valuation; (2) to identify
              and propose alternative methodologies for empirically studying community-based
              processes for articulating goals for environmental management, paying special
              attention to measuring how the values/preferences of participants change as a
              result of participation in such processes; and (3) to establish working
              relationships with two currently existing watershed management projects in
              Northern Georgia, one in the rural Etowah River watershed and one in the
              rapidly urbanizing Lake Lanier area on the Chattahoochee River.  The principal
              investigators, working with an Advisory Committee, will establish linkages
              between emerging theories of multi-criteria decision criteria and new,
              iterative, and participatory processes for identifying, clarifying, and
              reconciling competing values.  The theory to be explored hypothesizes that, in
              addition to well known value differences among stakeholder groups, there are
              also important conflicts between short-term, individual values as measured by
              actual and hypothetical valuation techniques of economists and the longer-term
              values that represent the aspirations of a community.  The investigators will
              develop and refine an iterative, community-based process to empirically study
              changes in values in response to discussions that encourage contrasts between
              immediate preferences and more community-based, multi-generational values. 
              Specifically, the investigators will delineate the scope and context of the
              case studies, identify group participants (which will likely include
              stakeholders, citizens, scientists, decision-makers, a moderator or
              facilitator, and the research team), and design the group processes and
              empirical instruments (such as interview protocols, surveys, and analytic
              procedures for operationalizing and measuring preference changes).  This
              research will provide a new system for examining community values, a system
              that differs both theoretically and methodologically from the more usual,
              single-criterion valuation approach (such as cost-benefit analysis).  The
              approach differs theoretically from welfare economics by considering the
              impacts of social interaction and participation in management processes on
              valuations made by citizens (rather than seeking aggregations of valuations by
              individuals acting atomistically), and also by expecting citizens' inputs into
              valuation processes to change in response to context and as a result of
              interactions with other citizens (rather than treating preferences as stable
              and unquestioned).  These theoretical departures from usual valuational work
              will shift emphasis from `snapshot` studies of fixed preferences toward study
              of an iterative process by which scientists, stakeholder groups, the public,
              and agency staff interact in a search for consensually accepted goals for
              environmental management.
