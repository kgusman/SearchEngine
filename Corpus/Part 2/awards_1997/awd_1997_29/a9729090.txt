              Abstract  ATM-9729090  Jackson, Stephen T.  University of Wyoming  Title:
              Isotopic Composition of Aquatic-Plant Tissues as  Paleoclimate Proxies    The
              SGER award supports a pilot study on isotopic composition of  aquatic plant
              tissues as a paleoclimate proxy.  The project is  aimed at developing, testing,
              and applying a new and untried  approach for inferring precipitation
              seasonality, moisture source,  and evaporation loss from small, freshwater
              lakes.  The work will  test a mass balance approach to determine whether it can
               successfully disentangle evaporation and precipitation signals from  lakewater
              data.  Stable isotopes will be studied from modern  lakewater, aquatic-plant
              seeds, lake sediments, and precipitation  from sites distributed over a wide
              area in the central and southern  Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau.  If
              successful, this  method should open the way for a variety of applications in 
              paleoclimate inference and model testing.
