Abstract    :
                This project develops a junior level biochemistry laboratory course which:  1.
              Provides students with the necessary skills to become attractive candidates to
              industrial recruiters or graduate schools; 2. Increases the interest and the
              ability of students to successfully carry out undergraduate research projects
              in their senior year; and 3. Serves as a model and guide for a variety of small
              institutions who wish to implement a similar class.  The model adapts for a
              consortium of small HBCU's and expands to a year long format a one semester
              laboratory course developed and implemented by Paul Craig of the Rochester
              Institute of Technology.  A number of new techniques are added to include the
              investigation of authentic unknowns.  Students learn cutting-edge methods in
              biochemistry and molecular biology and develop the critical thinking skills to
              analyze the original data they generate.  Evaluation of the course is
              accomplished through pre- and post-course examinations, attitudinal surveys and
              retrospective follow-up of student progress.  Results are being disseminated
              via a series of WWW pages that include student input.
