Abstract    :
              The overall goal of Project Inclusion is to provide appropriate materials and
              strategies to deal with student diversity.  The Project products will be a
              series of resource materials and an implementation process that supports
              faculty in focusing students' attention on the chemical contributions of women
              and minorities.  All Project materials are connected to the typical topics
              presented in introductory/general chemistry.  The resource materials are
              undergoing review by a set of external faculty members and a group of faculty
              participants from a summer workshop program, as well as through extensive
              field-testing by a number of interested faculty.  Summer workshops provide
              faculty with an opportunity to learn how to prepare and integrate Project
              materials into their classes.  Project Inclusion is being publicized in
              presentations at chemistry conferences, by announcements to a comprehensive
              mailing list and through journal articles.  Preliminary work in the Project
              supports the belief that use of Project Inclusion materials and strategies
              results in greater student interest and success in their chemistry classes. 
              Evaluation is primarily focused on measuring attitude changes in faculty and
              students through use of CBAM (Concerns Based Adoption Model).  The potential
              impact of the Project is tremendous as its audience is every lower division
              college chemistry class in the nation.
