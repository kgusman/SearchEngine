Abstract    :
              Proposal No.: 9721378  PI:  Stormont  University: U of New Mexico      ABSTRACT 
                Eight undergraduate students from the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Regions of
              the United States will participate in a nine-week, comprehensive research
              experience at the University of New Mexico during the summer of 1998.  In the
              summer of 1998, in accordance with his/her interests, each student will
              participate as a team member in one of the following projects: 1) conduct
              nondestructive evaluation of structures; 2) investigate new waste containment
              technologies using geosynthetic materials; 3) perform research in the area of
              construction management,, 4) construct small scale models of hydraulic
              structures and test these models in an open channel flow facility; 5) use an
              Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope to investigate degradation of
              structures; 6) use Geographic Information Systems to model contaminant
              transport; 7) develop an object-oriented computational mechanics toolkit; and
              8) development of practical new techniques for the remediation of polluted
              ground water.  More than half of the students will be selected from applicants
              at institutions other than UNM, especially those without active research
              programs.  Women, minority, and handicapped applicants, and other groups
              generally underrepresented in engineering particularly will be recruited.  The
              students will become familiar with their projects through early contact with
              the research faculty.  Each student can expect to learn to work independently
              over the course of the summer, while participating in a loosely knit group of
              graduate and undergraduate students.  He/she will also attend weekly group
              meetings, present a final seminar on the research, and assist in writing a
              publication describing the work.    The Department of Civil Engineering at UNM
              was a recipient of NSF-REU site awards in 1990 through 1997.  We enjoyed very
              productive summers all eight years, with a total of 83 students participating
              in various research projects.  Over the eight ye ars we have made offers to
              approximately 105 students, and ultimately 83 students accepted our offers. 
              More than two times as many qualified students are applying for the program as
              are accepted, thus providing a good level of competition which enables us to
              make offers to the most highly qualified students.  Approximately two thirds of
              our participants have been minorities and/or women.
