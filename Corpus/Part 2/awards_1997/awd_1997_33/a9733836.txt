Abstract    :
              Detailed simulation of many discrete event systems is often slow even on
              state-of-the-art workstations.  Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES)
              techniques offer an alternative to speed up such simulations.  However, PDES is
              a hard problem.  The irregular, data-dependent nature of most simulations make
              synchronization a difficult issue.  In this CAREER project an
              inter-disciplinary approach will be taken to address this problem.  A new class
              of "adaptive" protocols will be developed that integrates several mechanisms in
              a single framework, to achieve optimal performance automatically,
              notwithstanding the dynamic nature of most simulations.  The target platform is
              a network of workstations or possibly multiprocessors, connected by a
              high-speed network.  Several innovations are planned regarding protocol
              development and implementation in a PDES kernel on such platforms.  These
              include accounting for the multi-granular of the platform and use of fast,
              user-level messaging support. The work will focus on simulating of
              telecommunication and computer networks.
