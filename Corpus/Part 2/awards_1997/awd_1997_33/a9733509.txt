Abstract    :
              Abstract - Christofides - 9733509    The objective of this research is to
              develop a general and practical framework for the synthesis of nonlinear
              model-based feedback controllers for transport-reaction and particulate
              processes that achieve the desired stability and performance specifications in
              the presence of model uncertainty.  The motivation is provided by: a) the
              abundance of highly nonlinear transport-reaction (for example packed-bed
              reactors and chemical vapor deposition processes) and particulate (for example
              crystallizers and aerosol reactors) processes; b) the need for excellent
              control of these processes in order to minimize energy consumption and cost,
              achieve tighter performance specifications, and meet environmental and safety
              regulations; and c) the lack of practical nonlinear control methods for
              transport-reaction and particulate processes.  The specific research projects
              planned include: 1) control of diffusion-convection-reaction processes with
              time-dependent spatial domains, 2) control of transitional (not fully
              turbulent) fluid dynamic systems based on Navier-Stokes equations, and 3) model
              reduction and control of particulate processes based on population balance
              models.  The research will provide a fundamental understanding on the nature of
              the model reduction and control problems for transport-reaction and particulate
              processes.  It will also synthesize practically-implementable nonlinear
              feedback control algorithms that enforce the requested stability and
              performance specifications in the closed-loop system in the presence of model
              uncertainty.  The control algorithms will be applied to chemical vapor
              deposition processes, crystal growth processes, transitional channel and
              boundary layer flows, crystallizers and aerosol processes.  The development of
              a software package and the collaboration with companies (specifically, Trikon
              Technologies and Beta Squared) will be the means for transferring the results
              of the research to the industrial sector.    As part of this CAREER a ward,
              several educational activities are also planned, including: a) the integration
              of the model reduction and control methods into the undergraduate math and
              control courses, b) the development of an undergraduate process control lab, c)
              the development of a graduate level course on model reduction and control of
              nonlinear distributed parameter systems based on the results of the research,
              d) the design of open-ended projects for undergraduate students based on the
              research, e) the development of an industrial/graduate student internship
              program with companies in the microelectronics area, and f) the establishment
              of a unified control curriculum in the School of Engineering and Applied
              Science at UCLA.
