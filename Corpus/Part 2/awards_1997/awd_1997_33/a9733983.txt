Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to design molecules to self assemble into   one-
              and two-dimensional supramolecular motifs or aggregates that will   serve as
              scaffolds with which to control three-dimensional structures.    Cyclic
              diamides are targeted as the molecular building blocks .  Among   those to be
              studied are 2,5-diketopiperazines, 3,6-dioxo-1,2,4-triazines   and
              3,6-dioxo-1,2,4,5-tetrazines.  The robust one-dimensional `tapes`   obtained
              from these building blocks will then be used as precursors of   interesting
              solid state materials.  The educational focus of the project   is the
              integration of supramolecular chemistry into the undergraduate   curriculum. 
              With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the   Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research   and educational
              activities of Dr. G. Tayhas R. Palmore of the Department   of Chemistry at the
              University of California, Davis.   Professor Palmore    will focus her research
              efforts on  understanding how the self assembly   of molecules into
              supramolecular motifs can be used to control solid   state structure.  Self
              assembly of nanostructures promises to be one of   the most powerful approaches
              to device miniaturization.  The aim of the   proposed educational activities is
              to stimulate interdisciplinary   discussion and research in supramolecular
              chemistry and to integrate   supramolecular chemistry into the undergraduate
              curriculum.
