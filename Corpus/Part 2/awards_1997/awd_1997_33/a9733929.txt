              Abstract    Proposal:  97-33929  Northwestern University  PI:  Athanasius
              Ziliaskopoulos  "CAREER:  On-line Optimization and Control of Real-Time 
              Transportation Systems"      This CAREER award supports research concerned with
              the  problem of on-line control and optimization of the  operations of a
              real-time dynamic and stochastic  transportation system.  The motivation for
              this research is  two-fold:  to use to use new technological advances to 
              improve the control and management of transportation  operations; and to fill
              the gap created by the lack of  algorithms that can use these technologies to
              improve the  efficiency of transportation operations.    In addition to the
              research problems initiated by the  technological advances, several fundamental
              educational  issues are raised:  In general, students and practicing 
              transportation engineers do not have sufficient technical  background to fully
              appreciate the complex behavior of  stochastic and dynamic systems and the
              knowledge to exploit  the potential of real-time data.  This is partly due to 
              training that has traditionally been limited to the concepts  of equilibrium,
              steady state average system behavior and  determinism.  Educators are faced
              with the challenge of  developing innovative pedagogical material and
              methodologies  that convey the fundamental principles of dynamic and 
              stochastic systems, given the limited background of typical  engineering
              students.    The main research and educational objectives are:  to  analyze the
              operations of real-time transportation systems  and identify their properties;
              to develop closed form  analytical formulations by exploiting their special 
              properties and to explore various exact and heuristic  solution approached,
              optimality conditions for exact  algorithms and performance bounds for
              heuristic approaches;  and to develop new pedagogical tools that will enable 
              students to understand the fundamental principles of dynamic  and stochastic
              systems.  To achieve these objectives,  concepts from four  major areas will be
              utilized:  stochastic  programming, stochastic optimal control, process
              control,  and Markovian decision processes.
