Abstract    :
              CTS-9733876  Wassgren, Carl  Clemson University  Abstract    The objective is to
              investigate mixing and segregation of deep beds of single- and multi-component
              particulate mixtures in response to vertical and horizontal vibrations with
              sinusoidal and random oscillation profiles.  The work will consist of
              experiments utilizing high speed video and digital image processing for
              determining particle velocity fields and mixing concentrations, three
              dimensional discrete element computer simulations for investigating the effects
              of various parameters and environments, and analytical methods based on
              geometric arguments and kinetic theory for modeling the material response.     
              The proposed educational program will include the development of a course
              concerning particle science and technology.  Involvement of local industries
              and other universities will be a key aspect of the course.  Additionally, local
              companies concerned with particulate engineering issues will be encouraged to
              participate in the existing senior level "capstone" design course.  Java-based
              computer visualization tools for presenting fundamental engineering concepts
              will also be developed as part of the educational program.  These tools will
              result in more efficient class room instruction and better student
              comprehension of critical concepts.  World Wide Web pages will also be
              developed to supplement in-class topics.    If successful, the results of the
              proposed research will provide a better understanding and education of the
              fundamental mechanisms involved in mixing and segregation processes and may
              lead to improved designs for transporting, blending, and separating materials
              in industries handling particulates.  ***
