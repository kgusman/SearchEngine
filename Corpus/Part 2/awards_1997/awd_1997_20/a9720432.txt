Abstract    :
              The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the connection
              between attitudes and behaviors in social dyads.  The behaviors to be examined
              are judgments about sexual intercourse and condom use.  A methodology called
              `policy capturing` will be used that allows an assessment of the relative
              influence of partners' attitudes on decision-making.  Preliminary data suggest
              a model in which behavior is determined by the relative strength of `self` and
              `other` attitude components.  The experiments seek to test and expand this
              model.  Experiment 1 examines the effect on the relative influence of the self
              and the other of two variables: the importance of the other and the importance
              of the behavior.  Experiment 2 explores the relative influence on behavior of
              the cognitive and affective attitudes of the self and the other.  The
              experiment also asks whether relative influence is moderated by time
              constraints on decision-making.  Disparities between attitudes toward condoms
              and their use are frequently noted for heterosexual young adults, the
              population that will be studied.  As a group young adults appreciate the
              importance of condoms in preventing HIV but continue to engage in unprotected
              sex.  The study tests the hypothesis that some apparent discrepancies between
              attitudes and behavior occur when the attitudes of the partner, rather than
              one's own feelings and beliefs, guide decision-making.  In such instances, the
              impact of the partner on behavior may be unaccompanied by any change in
              attitude.  Thus the study diverges from traditional work in persuasion by
              examining the ability of others to influence behavior independent of any
              attitude change.  This research represents a profound shift in research for the
              investigator.  She was trained as a sensory psychologist and from 1976 through
              1995 worked in the area of visual psychophysics.  The POWRE award will have a
              major impact on her ability to conduct research and to develop related courses
              in social psychology.  She will also be able to begin training undergraduate
              and graduate students in this area.  Thus support will enhance her value both
              to her department and to her newly-chosen field.
