              ABSTRACT: NCR9720674  National Laboratory for Applied Networking Research
              (NLANR):  National Center for Network Engineering (NCNE)    In 1995, NSF
              awarded a cooperative agreement for a National Laboratory for Applied
              Networking Research (NLANR) providing for engineering, technical support and
              coordination of the vBNS connections at the supercomputing centers. The
              purposes of this NLANR team activity were (i) to provide sufficient testing,
              utilization and measurement of the NSFvBNS to insure that its overall
              performance was at acceptable levels, (ii) to facilitate the experiments to be
              performed on the NSFvBNS, and (iii) to provide for the coordination of support
              activities among the centers. It also provided limited engineering and
              technical support for general use of the NSFvBNS and provided for the
              coordination of such activities and facilitated the development at the
              supercomputing centers of a skilled and distributed network engineering team
              with a thorough knowledge of the NSFvBNS and its performance capabilities and
              use for high performance applications.    The recently initiated expansion of
              the NSFvBNS to encourage its use as a "leading edge but stable" platform to
              enable the development and use of high performance applications by the broader
              academic research community requires that the original NLANR activities be
              significantly expanded to encompass support for new users, sites and
              applications as well as continued measurement and testing of an expanded
              network. The need for this expansion has defined the NLANR activity into
              separate awards for three functional areas: the NLANR: Distributed Applications
              Support Team (DAST), located at the University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaigne, aimed at assisting the end users of high-performance
              applications in maximizing the performance of their applications; the NLANR:
              National Center for Network Engineering (NCNE), located at Carnegie-Mellon
              University, aimed at assisting high performance connections campuses in
              optimizing their network engine ering and connectivity; and the NLANR:
              Measurement and Operational Analysis Team (MOAT), located at the University of
              California, San, Diego, aimed at measuring and optimizing performance and use
              of the NSFvBNS and interconnected networks. The three efforts will continue to
              be be closely coodinated with each other and with the NSFvBNS.     The
              agreement provides for the NLANR: National Center for Network Engineering
              (NCNE)  which builds on the previous NLANR activity and the experience of
              Carnegie Mellon University's network engineering personnel at the Pittsburgh
              Supercomputer Center in analyzing and supporting the problems and peculiarities
              associated with  high performance networking activities. NCNE will place
              network engineers in direct contact with campus networking personnel at High
              Performance Connections inatitutions andwill host workshops to facilitate the
              transfer of expertise supporting high performance networking to service
              organizations at those institutions. NCNE establishes a central help desk for
              High Performance Connection award sites to support and assist campus and other
              local service organizations in the resolution of network engineering problems
              related to campus networks, their connections to the vBNS and other engineering
              issues relevant to networks associated with the High Performance Connections
              program.
