Abstract    :
                  Garcia, G.   MCB 97-20139  1. Technical  The biosynthesis of tRNA is a
              surprisingly complicated process.  One, much neglected aspect of this process
              is the incorporation of modified bases.  The physiological roles of modified
              bases are largely unknown, however, there is evidence that they are involved in
              differentiation, proliferation, and ribosomal frameshifting.  A key enzyme in
              the biosynthetic pathway in E. coli of the modified nucleoside queuine is
              tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT).  Experiments designed for this study have
              three specific aims, the first of which is to extend previous studies of the
              recognition of tRNA by TGT.  A collaboration has been established with Dr. Ralf
              Ficner (University of Marburg, Germany) to determine the structure of a tRNA
              TGT complex as well as structures of mutant enzymes and interesting tRNA
              analogues.  Concurrently, the generation and evaluation of tRNA chimeras and a
              biochemical investigation of ribose phosphate backbone recognition by TGT is
              carried out.  The second specific aim involves a combination of analogue
              design/synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis to study heterocyclic substrate
              recognition by TGT.  The third specific aim is to use the mutant TGTs with
              altered tRNA and heterocyclic substrate recognition developed in specific aims
              1 and 2 to probe the role of the queuine modification.    2. Nontechnical  The
              biosynthesis of tRNA is a surprisingly complicated process.  One, much
              neglected aspect of this process involves the incorporation and physiological
              role(s) of modified bases.  This project is undertaken to advance previous
              studies of the key enzyme involved in the modification of tRNA with queuine,
              tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT).  The specific aims of the project are to
              elucidate how proteins recognize nucleic acids (tRNA) and small molecules, and
              to understand the physiological role of the queuine modification.
