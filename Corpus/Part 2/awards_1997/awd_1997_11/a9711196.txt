Abstract    :
               This project compares technical education programs in nineteenth-century
              Philadelphia in order to understand how people thought about skill, technology,
              and what children should learn in that time of industrial change.  Technical
              education prepares children for productive lives as adults, and the adults
              providing it expect to teach boys how to become men and to teach girls how to
              become women.  Some children will learn to become good factory workers, while
              others will become good engineers.  Studying technical education allows us to
              examine the ways work and technology are related to ideas about gender,
              ethnicity and social class.  Technical education, defined broadly, includes
              teaching juvenile delinquents how to sew as well as teaching promising young
              apprentices how to make mechanical drawings.  But such opportunities were
              provided selectively, based on educators' expectations about what children
              would be doing as adults.  Careful study of reports, managers' minutes, and
              curricula allows the PI to develop evidence about what children learned and how
              it was justified.  For example, in the public schools of the 1880s and 1809s,
              when arguments for curricular change were often couched in language about
              democracy and opportunity, some children-middle-class high-school boys-were
              taught to understand science and theory and design, while other children-recent
              immigrants, expected to work in factories by age 14-were taught to copy an
              object chosen by their teacher, with an emphasis on neatness and obedience. 
              Girls' training, even when it led to paid work in industrial textile design,
              was described in terms of women's domestic talents.
