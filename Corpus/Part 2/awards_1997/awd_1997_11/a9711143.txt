Abstract    :
              Cultural differences in societies and organizations are believed to influence
              individual expectations for and perceptions of one's environment, modes of
              social interaction, and expressions of emotions and global behavior patterns
              such as leadership and conflict management styles. The Global Leadership and
              Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) research program is an ongoing
              effort designed to investigate three issues connected to this topic. First,
              GLOBE is designed to determine the process by which culture influences the type
              of leadership behavior desired by people in organizations and societies.
              Second, GLOBE focuses on differences across cultures in terms of the value
              placed on certain leadership behaviors, the scope of leader influence, the
              social status of leaders, and the amount of power granted to leaders. Third,
              GLOBE identifies country specific and universal cultural syndromes in each of
              the cultures studied. The GLOBE sample of countries represents a wide variety
              of cultures, and every major region of the world is represented by at least
              three countries. These data permit an assessment of the degree to which a
              number of leader behaviors that are central to prevailing leadership theory are
              accepted and viewed as effective in each of the countries studied. The current
              project is to finish coding, analysis, and synthesis of the data already
              collected for this phase of the GLOBE research program.
