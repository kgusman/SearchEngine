Abstract    :
              This project continues studying the transport and deposition of energy in the
              ring current and underlying ionosphere, including (1) the contribution of
              magnetotail currents to the Dst index, (2) the importance of superdense plasma
              sheets to the formation of the most intense ring currents, (3) the relationship
              between energy input into the inner magnetosphere and upstream solar wind
              density, (4) the physical processes producing intense midlatitude ion
              precipitation during large magnetic storms, and the role of this precipitation
              in ring current decay, (5) the association between stretched magnetic field
              lines, violation of the first adiabatic invariant and intense subauroral ion
              precipitation during major storms, (6) the effects of outflow at the dayside
              magnetopause on ring current energy balance during the main phases of large
              storms, (7) the impact of electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave interactions in
              producing precipitation loss from the ring current, redistributing energy
              between ring current ion species and channeling ring current energy into the
              thermal populations of the inner magnetosphere, and (8) the major sources and
              sinks of suprathermal ion populations in the inner magnetosphere, their
              distribution in L value and local time, their relationship to magnetic storms
              and to the heating of thermal ions during disturbed conditions.  The PI will
              investigate these fundamental physical processes, emphasizing the coupling of
              ring current energy into the underlying ionosphere by heat and particle fluxes,
              and the affect of changing solar wind and magnetospheric conditions on this
              coupling.
