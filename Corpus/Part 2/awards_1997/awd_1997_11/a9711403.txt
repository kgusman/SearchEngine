Abstract    :
              Unreliable failure detection has been gaining acceptance as  a fundamental
              paradigm for fault-tolerant distributed  computing. This paradigm was
              originally introduced to  circumvent the impossibility of achieving consensus
              in  asynchronous systems with crash failures.  The proposed  research aims to
              extend the applicability of failure  detection in multiple ways: (1) It will
              seek solutions that  tolerate both process crashes and link failures, and in 
              particular, solutions that are resilient to network  partitioning. (2) It will
              consider practical problems  besides consensus, e.g., atomic commitment and
              various forms  of group membership. (3) It will investigate the extension  of
              failure detection to other models, such as the timed  asynchronous model, in
              order to solve problems whose  specifications involve real-time. (4) It will
              explore the  use of randomization techniques to enhance the power of  failure
              detection. This research intends to widen the scope  of failure detection and
              to firmly establish it as a core  component of fault-tolerant distributed
              systems.
