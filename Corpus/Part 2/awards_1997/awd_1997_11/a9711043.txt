Abstract    :
              Using television as a case study, this study contributes to the broad
              understanding of the complex relationship between technology and society in
              twentieth century America. It focuses on the technological and organizational
              development of television from its beginnings as a laboratory experiment in the
              first decades of the twentieth century to its maturity as a large technological
              system in the postwar years.  The research and business strategy of the
              electronics firms involved in television changed fundamentally from the prewar
              to the postwar period.  As such, television serves as a case study of how an
              industry, its research structure, and a complex technological system changed in
              response to the profound transformations of World War II and the Cold War. 
              Drawing from a wide range of documentary sources, the study analyzes the large
              technological system of television through much of the twentieth century.  It
              is driven by a series of questions, much of which are embedded in the broad
              historical literatures on American technology, industrial research, and Cold
              War science and technology.  How did independent and corporate inventors
              define, approach, and solve the `problem` of television in the 1930's? What
              were the implications of WWII for the technology of television and for the ways
              in which research was managed at U.S. electronic firms?  How did the Cold War
              influence the development of consumer electronics in the postwar years?  In
              what ways was television applied to military projects?
