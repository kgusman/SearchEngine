Abstract    :
                        Symposium on Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics                      
                Robert E. Kass                   Carnegie Mellon University         A
              symposium entitled ``Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics 4''  will be held at
              Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,   on Friday September
              26 and Saturday September 27, 1997.  The symposium   will include four extended
              presentations of applications of Bayesian   methods to a range of medical and
              industrial applications. More   specifically, topics of the selected
              presentations inalude: modeling   for risk of breast cancer, pharmacokinetic
              modeling in drug   development, problems of customer value analysis, and
              statistical   aspects of functional MRI. In these applications the statistician
               was an integral member of the research team. A contributed poster   session
              will also be held.  The objectives of the symposium are to:   (i) identify and
              focus attention on specific implementation and        theoretical problems that
              hinder applications of Bayesian         methods, and to identify candidate
              solutions;  (ii) provide a forum in which the interplay between statistical    
                 theory and practice will be explored in the context of concrete        
              research projects;   (iii) provide a small-meeting atmosphere within which
              junior investigators        and graduate students can explore substantial
              Bayesian applications         with experienced researchers;  and  (iv) produce
              a  volume containing well-documented case studies and data        sets suitable
              for use by researchers, practitioners, educators         and students of
              applied statistics and other quantitative fields.        As increasingly much
              background information becomes available to   scientists undertaking an
              investigation, it is important to utilize   previous knowledge effectively in
              designing studies and analyzing   data. Bayesian statistical methods are
              tailored to this purpose.   There have been many recent advances in Bayesian
              statistical theory   and computation, b ut scientific meetings rarely spend
              substantial   time discussing applications. The purpose of this symposium is to
                concentrate attention solely on applications of Bayesian statistics.   The
              goal is to elucidate the interplay between theory and practice   and thereby
              identify successful methods and indicate important   directions for future
              research.
