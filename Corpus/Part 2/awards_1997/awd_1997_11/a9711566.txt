Abstract    :
              Instruction-level parallel (ILP) processing has been an area  of great interest
              in the computer architecture community and  the semiconductor industry.  Almost
              all of the processors  developed since the last decade do ILP processing in a
              major  way.  Ongoing advances in ILP processing necessitate a careful 
              examination of the amount of parallelism that exists in  typical programs under
              various execution models. The main  objective of this research is to
              investigate the potential of  pursuing multiple control flows in ILP
              processors.  The study  starts by quantifying the effect of different control
              flow  constraints on available parallelism.  Software support for  pursuing
              multiple control flows is then studied.  Novel  methods to specify control
              independence and data independence  to the hardware are part of this study on
              software support.  This research also studies hardware issues relevant to 
              pursuing multiple control flows, such as tradeoffs between the  number of
              speculative paths and performance using detailed  simulation models. 
              Preliminary simulation studies have been  conducted to get an idea of the
              amount of parallelism  available with single control flow and multiple control
              flows.  These preliminary results indicate a factor of 2 increase in  available
              parallelism when multiple control flows is pursued  instead of a single control
              flow.
