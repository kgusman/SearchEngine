Abstract    :
              9711076  Smith        It has long been known that mountains influence not only
              local, but also regional  and synoptic-scale weather.  The understanding of how
              mountains influence the weather  and climate has advanced considerably over the
              last forty years, but there remain  significant areas of uncertainty which
              limit accurate weather forecasting and  environmental decision making.  Two
              important scientific frontiers are (1) the influence  of mesoscale mountain
              features on regional, synoptic and global weather patterns and  (2) new
              technologies for observing orographic influences and testing numerical models. 
                       Methodology to be utilized by the Principal Investigator will include
              the use of  theoretical fluid mechanics and numerical calculations using a
              simple, two-layer fluid  model and an advanced three-dimensional mesoscale
              numerical model.  Additionally,  the Principal Investigator will pursue a
              variety of observational techniques by  conducting small, focused field
              efforts.  The Principal Investigator also will be a major  participant and
              coordinator of the U.S. component of  a large, international research  project
              know as the Mesoscale Alpine Program (MAP).  The MAP will focus on  several
              aspects of the impact of mountains on local, regional and synoptic-scale 
              weather.        Successful completion of this research will result in enhanced
              knowledge of the  impacts of orography on weather.  This may lead to better
              representations of orographic  impacts in numerical models which in turn could
              result in improved weather forecasts.  ***
