Abstract    :
              9710061  Humphrey     We propose a comprehensive study of a rock glacier at
              Galena Creek in the Absaroka Mountains, northwestern  Wyoming, to determine the
              potential of rock glaciers as sources for ice-core paleoclimate records.  The
              Galena Creek rock glacier is one of the most easily-accessible and well-studied
              glaciological techniques to the Galena Creek rock glacier to determine mass
              balance, flow characteristics, and internal composition and chemistry.   Rock
              glaciers are ubiquitous features in arctic and alpine regions, yet they have
              been largely ignored by glaciologists, in part because of the widely-held
              belief that they are essentially ice-cemented talus.  We have demonstrated
              previously that the Galena Creek rock glacier contains remnant glacier ice that
              can be retrieved by ice-core drilling.  Our project draws on the combined
              expertise of two glacial-geologists (NP and DC) who have worked extensively
              with rock glaciers, an ice-core geochemist (ES), and two glaciologists (WP and
              NH).  Geophysics work will include drilling of several boreholes (40-60 meters
              depth) for deformation measurements, measurement of surface velocities, and
              retrieval of ice cores.  Ice cores will be analyzed for stable isotopes ((18O
              and (D), electrical conductivity, and visual stratigraphy.  Expected results of
              this work include 1) improved understanding of the climatic context of rock
              glaciers and 2) evaluation of a new and potentially powerful source of ice-core
              paleoclimate data.
