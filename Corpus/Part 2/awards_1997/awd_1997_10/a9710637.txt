Abstract    :
              ***  9710637  Dunn     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              addresses the problems associated with current microelectronic lithography
              systems which utilize masking technology.  These problems include:  the need
              for multiple masks required for subsequent layers of an electronic module;  the
              difficulties associated with generating large-area masks;  and the dependence
              on foreign suppliers for mask substrates.  The only available technology which
              does not require masks is laser direct-write imaging which suffers from an
              inherently slow speed due to it's bit-by-bit, serial mode of addressing.  This
              project would eliminate those short-comings through the development of a
              maskless, large-area, high-throughput, high-resolution, lithography system
              which combines a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) with patterning technology. 
              The DMD is a micro-mechanical, spatial light modulator with high
              parallel-processing power which replaces the conventional mask seamless
              scanning technology.  It can generate any possible pattern with high resolution
              over an unlimited area.   The proposed program will fill a critical need in the
              microelectronics manufacturing industry, and also significantly increase U.S.
              competitiveness in an enabling technology area.  The composite market for
              maskless lithography systems  comprise four major application segments;
              flat-panel displays, (FPD's), multi-chip modules (MCM's), printed circuit
              boards (PCB's), and semiconductor integrated circuits (IC's). The total sales
              for these products exceeded $750 million in 1996 and is project to grow to over
              $1.5 billion in the 2002.  ***
