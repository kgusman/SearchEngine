Abstract    :
              Predation has been invoked as a strong selective pressure on many aspects of
              primate behavior.  This project proposes to expand our understanding of
              predation as a selective pressure on primate behavioral patterns by
              investigating the relationship between habitat structure and anti-predator
              behavior in sympatric vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and patas monkeys
              (Erythrocebus patas) in Laikipia, Kenya.  Despite being closely related,
              similar in body size, and sharing the same community of predators, vervets and
              patas monkeys appear to differ in their responses to perceived risk of
              predation in many ways, including their choice of sleeping sites, the behavior
              of mothers and infants in the presence of predators, and their escape tactics. 
              These differences are hypothesized to be due to differences in the structure of
              the habitat used by each species; including use of different tree species, and
              differences in tree height and density of grass cover.  This hypothesis will be
              examined through quantitative measurement of habitat structure, including tree
              height and grass height and density, and by observation of  1) the animals'
              responses to predators,  2) responses to naturally occurring alarm calls given
              by other monkeys, and  3) responses to pre-recorded alarm calls of monkeys that
              are played back to them in a controlled, experimental design. The results of
              this project promise to elevate our understanding of predation as a selective
              pressure on primate behavior, and to assist in reconstructing the behavioral
              ecology of early, sympatric hominids.
