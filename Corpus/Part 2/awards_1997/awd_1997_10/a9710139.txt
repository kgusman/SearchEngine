Abstract    :
              9710139  Thompson    This is an experimental and theoretical research effort on 
              the evolution of structure and the mechanical state of  polycrystalline films
              during thin metal film deposition and  during subsequent thermal processing. 
              The goal of the  research is to develop models and simulations which can be 
              used to predict the course of grain size, grain orientation  and stress
              evolution as a function of substrate, film and  capping layer material
              properties, while also considering  the deposition conditions and subsequent
              thermal history.  The stresses in films deposited on substrates are monitored 
              using wafer curvature measurements made while heating at  controlled and
              variable rates and while annealing at  different temperatures for different
              times.  Film material,  capping layers, film thickness, and film deposition 
              temperature are among the varied parameters in these  experiments.  In situ TEM
              observations explore grain  structure evolution in heated films on thin
              substrates which  impose a strain in the films due to differential thermal 
              expansion.  Texture of the films is monitored by X-ray  analyses.  %%%  As
              modeling and simulation capabilities evolve through  comparison with
              experiments, new quantitative capabilities  are developed for predicting grain
              structure, grain  orientation, and stress evolution. This  provides techniques 
              for processing of films with properties that are optimized  for specific
              engineering applications.  Polycrystalline  films are used in electronic,
              micromechanical, and magnetic  devices.  In these applications, the performance
              and  reliability of polycrystalline films are strongly affected  by their
              structure, specifically the distribution of grain  sizes and crystallographic
              orientations.  ***
