Abstract    :
              ***  9761414  Lyon    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              directed at development of a liquid absorbent process for the selective
              separation of xylene isomers from mixed-isomer streams. The program builds on
              previous Bend Research work aimed at the separation of N2 from natural gas.
              Focus will be on the development of liquid absorbents for the separation of
              p-xylene from mixed-xylene streams, which are produced in petrochemical plants
              during the cracking of petroleum fractions.  In Phase I, candidate absorbents
              will be screened and their performance evaluated using an in-depth economic and
              engineering model developed in previous work.  In Phase II, the performance of
              the best absorbents will be optimized to achieve the properties and performance
              needed for a successful commercial process.    This process promises to offer
              major cost advantages for the production of p-xylenes.  More than 5 billion
              pounds of p-xylenes are consumed annually.  Because it should be applicable to
              other types of separations such as ethylene/ethane, propylene/propane and
              branched/straight-chain olefin isomer separations, it could streamline
              petrochemical manufacturing processes by debottlenecking existing facilities.
