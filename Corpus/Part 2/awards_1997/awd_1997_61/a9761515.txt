Abstract    :
                ***   9761515  Sengupta    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase I project will explore a process that uses continuous heat treatment for
              manufacturing BSCCO-2212 wire with micron-sized filaments.  Although steady
              progress has been achieved in high temperature superconductor (HTS) wires and
              tapes, they are not fully commercialized.  This innovation is expected to
              produce long multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 wire competitive in cost and
              performance with niobium tin compound (Nb3Sn) wire.  Phase I will demonstrate
              the cost-effective fabrication of high-performance multifilamentary BSCCO-2212
              silver (Ag) alloy sheathed wire with filament diameters of 2-4 microns by using
              continuous heat treatment.  Phase I will focus on the optimum particle size and
              distribution of powders suitable for fabrication of wires with 2-4 micron
              filaments.  Drawing parameters to produce mechanically uniform wires without
              will be determined.  The temperature gradient and the pass rate will be
              optimized to achieve desired properties.  Phase II would pursue optimizing
              process parameters and fabrication of long-length (200-500 meter)
              multifilamentary wires.    Commercial application of high-performance
              multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 wire is expected in production of a new generation
              of high-field magnets or magnet inserts which may operate at fields in excess
              of 20 Tesla.  These ultra-high field magnets would significantly impact further
              development of high energy physics, advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
              and neutron magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, and energy storage devices,
              e.g., superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and micro SMES.  ***
