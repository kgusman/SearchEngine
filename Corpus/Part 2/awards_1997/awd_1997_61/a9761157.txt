Abstract    :
              ***  9761157  Wang    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              aims to develop an active strain gauge, to directly address the requirements of
              a new generation of sensor technology.  Monitoring the performance of
              structures during earthquakes using sensors is very important for earthquake
              hazard mitigation. Existing strain gauges, both the foil and fiber-optic types,
              with their excitation and signal conditioning are relatively expensive, require
              long lead wires to get to the interrogating point, have high power
              requirements, all of which makes instrumenting a large civil structure
              prohibitively expensive.  The choice of an active material such as
              polyvinylidede flouride (PVDF) as a strain gauge provides basic advantages in
              terms of the signal processing requirements, low power requirements, low noise
              threshold, and above all the ability to eliminate the usage of lead wires to
              interrogate the gauge.  The objectives of the current research is to prove the
              concept of a PVDF strain gauge and pave the way for the development a true self
              contained wireless strain gauge.    The potential commercial applications will
              be in the area of infrastructure monitoring.  The choice of PVDF will provide a
              relatively inexpensive material for the sensor, The active nature of the sensor
              will help in keeping the design of the basic signal processing rather simple,
              which will result in a low cost signal processing which will be easy to
              integrate with a RF circuit.  ***
