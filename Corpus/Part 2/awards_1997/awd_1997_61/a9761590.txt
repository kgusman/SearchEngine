Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Visible
              Productions L.L.C. seeks to develop the initial version of a software system
              that can efficiently create 3D polygonal mesh surface models of anatomical
              structures from 2D section data such as CT, MRI and Visible Human Project
              images.  The software systems will consist of refining and integrating the
              following existing modules: 1) Semi-automated tracing module, which utilizes
              neural networks to perform user-assisted and semi-automated tracing of the
              perimeters of anatomical structures on 2D section images; 2) 3D model-based
              registration module which transforms adjacent section images and individual
              structures as necessary to ensure proper alignment and registration; 3)
              Automatic connectivity triangulation module, an  improved triangulation
              software which creates 3D polygon surfaces from the traced 2D perimeters with
              little user intervention;  and 4) Post-processing system, an improved software
              for editing, decimating, and reshaping polygonal mesh surfaces for customizing
              the models.  The Phase I will concentrate on development and testing of the
              semi-automated tracing module since this is the least developed component in
              Visible Productions' current system.  A concept and plan for a model-based
              registration system will be generated.  Visible Productions' existing
              triangulation and post-processing modules will be improved and the project team
              will begin the integration effort with other modules.   There is a very large
              market for 3D polygonal mesh models of anatomical structures, but the tools
              available to create these models are very limited.  The users of such models
              include researchers, educators, medical professionals, diagnosticians,
              multimedia publishers, simulation design specialists, and entertainment and
              gaming industry engineers.  Visible Productions' software would allow these
              diverse groups to efficiently create their own models at a reasonable price. 
              Also, the system will allow the creation of custom models for customers at a
              much faster rate than is currently possible.
