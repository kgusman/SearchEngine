              Wright  Mesozoic arc-related shortening is a widespread feature in the western
              U.S. Cordillera, Jurassic shortening is most prominent within Mesozoic arc
              assemblages of the westernmost Cordillera, whereas Cretaceous shortening is
              most prominent in the back-arc region to the east.  Recent work has suggested
              that the change is a response to changing parameters of subduction (geometry
              and rate) along the active plate margin.  However, the Jurassic and Cretaceous
              episodes are not completely separated spatially, and overlap particularly in
              the western back-arc region.  This project involves age dating of the various
              deformation events in the Luning-Fencemaker fold and thrust belt.  Results
              should clarify the timing of the overlapping deformations and allow a more
              complete picture of how changing subduction parameters affects spatial
              distribution of deformation.
