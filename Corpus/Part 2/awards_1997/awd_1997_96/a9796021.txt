Abstract    :
              Zhang    The investigator intends to study Arakelov theory. The following are
              some proposed problems: a) Arakelov theory of stable curves and their moduli
              spaces using Poincare metric;  b) Application of the equidistribution theorem
              of small points to Serre's open image type theorem for high dimensional abelian
              varieties,  and to Chinberg and Rumely's capacity theory; c) Verification of
              two conjectures on Hecke algebras and heights on CM-cycles of high weight for
              Shimura abelian varieties; d) Study the Arakelov zeta function and apply it to
              a probabilistic version of the effective version of Mordell conjecture.    This
              is research in  the intersection of the fields of number theory and algebraic
              geometry.  In its origin,  number theory studied integral solutions of
              polynomial equations, while algebraic geometry treated  figures that could be
              defined by polynomial equations. Nowadays the fields make use of methods not
              only from algebra,  but also from analysis,  topology,  and  differential
              geometry, and conversely are finding application in those fields as well as in
              physics,  theoretical computer science,  and robotics.
