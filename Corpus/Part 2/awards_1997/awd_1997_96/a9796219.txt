Abstract    :
              9632989  Chen    The proposed research will study the dynamics of  ferroelectric
              domain walls and phase boundaries, which, in  perovskites, are nearly
              atomically sharp with a thickness of  the order of one to two atomic layer
              spacings. For such  sharp interfaces, the mechanism of interfacial steps (in 
              analogy to dislocation jogs and kinks) along with  interactions of interfaces
              and obstacles (in analogy to  dislocation pinning and bow-out) is central to
              the  understanding of interfacial dynamics.  These  characteristics will be
              directly probed by measuring the  migration energy, formation energy, and
              activation volume of  the interfacial steps in expressly designed experiments 
              under a stress field or an electrical field and will be  complemented by
              additional structural and simulation studies  that focus on the atomistics of
              the step mechanism for  domain walls and phase boundaries. Three families of 
              prototypical ferroelectrics with a perovskite structure,  BaTiO3,
              Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 (PZT) and Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PMN),  along with their various
              compositional and microstructural  modifications, will be investigated. For
              BaTiO3 and PZT type  of ceramics, which have a sharp transition at the Curie 
              temperature, Tc, the interest is primarily on the dynamics  of domain walls
              below Tc. For PMN type of ceramics, which  have a broader permittivity peak
              with the actual transition  diffuse and well below the temperature of maximum 
              permittivity (Tmax), the studies will be directed to the  dynamics of phase
              boundaries below Tmax.  Relaxation  spectroscopy  will be used to measure
              activation energy and  activation volumes of mobile interfaces, which can be 
              conveniently performed using polarization relaxation at  small field and stress
              relaxation at large field.  To lend  further insight into the atomistic
              mechanisms that affect  polarization reversal and interface mobility,
              synchrotron x-  ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) studies and Monte-Carlo 
              lattice simulations will be conducted. These investigations   will be carried
              out for both model ferroelectrics and their  modifications to delineate the
              broader effects of chemistry,  defect, and nanostructure that can influence
              interfacial  dynamics by either providing obstacles to interface motion  or by
              altering the mobility of the interface itself. The  goal of the research is to
              provide a unified and detailed  understanding, from the viewpoint of interface
              dynamics, of  various interface-controlled ferroelectric, ferroelastic and 
              piezoelectric phenomena that have broad implications to the  performance and
              long-term reliability of ferroelectric  ceramics as devices.  %%%  The goal of
