Abstract    :
              9734886  LJUNGGREN    This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment for the research vessel MAURICE EWING, operated by the Lamont-Doherty
              Earth Observatory of Columbia University and dedicated to use in support of
              ocean science research.         The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
              Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
              safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such 
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.       The Project Director, Paul Ljunggren is fully qualified
              to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.    This project will allow
              the institution to replace the winch control booth, modify the coring winch's
              level wind, and acquire a back up compressor, a stud welder, five anti exposure
              suits, an infrared thermometer, a copy machine and a computer.  ***
