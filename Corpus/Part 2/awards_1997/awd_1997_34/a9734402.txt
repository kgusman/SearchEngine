Abstract    :
                  Abstract - Lee        This is a study of the interaction of fuel spray
              mixing and combustion in a lean direct-injection engine.  Advanced optical
              diagnostics and multi-dimensional modeling are used to characterize in-cylinder
              fuel/air mixing and combustion in an optically accessible, direct-injection
              engine.  Optical diagnostics include exciplex fluorescence for visualization of
              spatial distributions of liquid and vapor fuel under firing conditions, planar
              laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) with fuel dopants for visualization of liquid
              fuel, and phase/Doppler particle analysis (P/DPA) to characterize drop size and
              velocity of the spray.  In addition, a new planar droplet sizing technique is
              developed by imaging exciplex liquid fluorescence and Mie scattering signals
              simultaneously; the ratio of these signals is proportional to the Sauter mean
              diameter and the technique can be calibrated using the P/DPA measurements. 
              Computations are performed within the framework of a model for two-phase
              reacting flows that has been used for comparisons of spray and engine
              measurements.    The results of this work should provide the fundamental basis
              for design of a successful lean direct-injection spark-injection engine.  Such
              an engine is believed to offer improved fuel economy and reduced emissions, but
              its development has been hampered by poor understanding of the relationships
              among fuel injection, mixing, and combustion.
