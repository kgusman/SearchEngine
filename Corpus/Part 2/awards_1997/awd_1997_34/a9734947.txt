Abstract    :
              DMI-9734947  Kyriakides  The space frame is the preferred design concept for
              all-aluminum light-weight cars. It is made of extruded tubes that are stretch
              formed to the required shape and joined by nodes. Automated assembly requires
              unusually tight dimensional tolerances on the formed tubes. To achieve these,
              the hollow extrusions are prestretched and bent to the required shapes over
              dies. An unwanted byproduct of this process is distortion of their cross
              section. Tension applied during bending over a mandrel aggravates such cross
              sectional distortions. To reduce this unwanted deformation, the parts are
              internally pressurized. At the present, the design parameters for each part
              (i.e. die shape, prestretch load, level of internal pressure) are selected
              empirically which is both costly and slow.   This two-year project will use a
              combination of experiment and analysis to study the stretch forming process,
              understand the factors that govern it, and develop methods for optimizing it.
              The project is a joint venture between Industry (Alcoa) and University
              (UT-Austin). The experiments will be conducted in a custom
              bend-stretch-pressure forming facility recently developed. The three axes of
              loading have closed-loop control that allows operation of the facility via a
              computer. Custom nonlinear analyses have been developed which are capable of
              predicting the cross sectional changes of rectangular tubes bent over a rigid
              surface while being stretched and internally pressurized. This work will
              involve the use of the test facility along with the analyses to understand and
              optimize this manufacturing process on more general shapes.
