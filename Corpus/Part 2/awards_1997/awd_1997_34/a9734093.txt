Abstract    :
              9734093  Bush    Abstract    The contractile vacuole has long been studied as a
              subcellular model for the mammalian kidney.  In Protozoans and other primitive
              animals where it is found, it is an essential organelle that maintains water
              and ion homeostasis within the organism.  Presumably, study of its structure
              and function will provide insights into how more complex systems have evolved
              to perform these same functions in higher animals.  This proposal exploits the
              genetics of Dictyostelium discoideum to study the role of a particular GTPase
              (Rab11) in the biogenesis of the contractile vacuole.  Previous studies have
              shown that this protein is localized to the contractile vacuole and, arguing
              from studies of Rab function in other systems, is probably important in the
              regulation of vesicle traffic to and from this compartment.  The studies will
              utilize a number of genetic approaches to study how normal and mutant versions
              of Rab11 influence the biogenesis of the vacuole.  Additional studies will
              evaluate the possibility that other Rab-associated proteins are important in
              Rab control of vacuole biogenesis and function.  ***
