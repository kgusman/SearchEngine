Abstract    :
              9722392  Palmer  A career development program is described that integrates
              research and pedagogy of structure/function by NMR spectroscopy.  The research
              program will provide a molecular basis for understanding molecular recognition
              in RNA-protein complexes as well as transcription termination/antitermination
              in lambdoid coliphages.  The initial goal is the characterization of the
              interaction between HK022 Nun protein and Box B RNA sequences.  The educational
              objectives of this proposal are the development of resources for the teaching
              and self-study of high resolution NMR spectroscopy.  High-resolution NMR
              spectroscopy is an increasingly important component of chemical and biological
              research in academic and industrial settings, and courses in NMR spectroscopy
              are offered at an expanding number of universities.  The educational efforts
              are based on the textbook, entitled Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and
              Practice, co-authored by the PI of this proposal.  Course materials will be
              used in the course "NMR spectroscopy of biological macromolecules", taught at
              Columbia University, and will be distributed via the Internet.    Understanding
              the mechanisms by which proteins specifically recognize and interact with other
              molecules is a critical research problem in chemistry, biophysics, and
              biotechnology.  The research component of this proposal will use NMR
              spectroscopy to elucidate the nature of the interactions between proteins and
              RNA molecules that are important for molecular recognition.  The educational
              component will develop computer-based materials for teaching NMR spectroscopy
              at the advanced undergraduate and graduate university levels.  The educational
              materials will complement the textbook, entitled Protein NMR Spectroscopy:
              Principles and Practice, co-authored by the PI.  ***
