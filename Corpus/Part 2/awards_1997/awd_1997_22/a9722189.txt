Abstract    :
              Theoretical research in several different areas of  gravitational wave
              astronomy, and also in areas of  gravitation physics and relativistic
              astrophysics will be  studied.  The principal topics are: (A) theoretical 
              simulations of the accuracy with which a network of  gravitational wave
              detectors will be able to measure the  distances to and masses of coalescing
              binary neutron stars,  the most promising expected type of source; (B) 
              investigations of how this accuracy will be improved by the  construction, now
              being considered, of additional detector  systems in Japan and/or Australia;
              (C) determining the  required level of accuracy for theoretical template 
              waveforms that will be used to analyze the experimental  data; (D) developing
              new calculational tools that will be  useful in future calculations of low
              frequency waves from  supermassive black holes; (E) exploring quantitatively
              the  prospects for measuring gravitational waves from distant  black hole ---
              black hole mergers, both by ground based  detectors and possible future
              space-based detectors; (F) an  exploration of the effects of `anti-gravity`
              that occur when  quantum fields are coupled to classical gravity, motivated  by
              the expectation that this phenomenon will yield insight  into the nature of
              quantum gravity; (G) theoretical  explorations of the structure of a black
              hole's interior  which probe deeply into the theoretical structure of general 
              relativity and bring out its poorly-understood nonlinear  features.  In
              addition a comprehensive introductory course will be  developed and taught at
              Cornell to graduate students and  interested faculty, covering the various
              aspects of  gravitational wave astronomy: the physical properties of the  waves
              as predicted by general relativity, the experimental  technology to detect
              them, the catalogue of anticipated  sources, and the information we hope to
              extract from the  waves about the nature of gravity, about cosmology, and 
              about the various sources.  The lecture notes will be made  available on the
              world wide web so as to be accessible to a  wide audience beyond Cornell. 
              These web pages will be  periodically updated to bring them up to date with the
               latest theoretical and experimental research in the field,  thus tying the
              educational facility closely to current  research.  In summary, it is hoped
              that the course will  contribute to curriculum development, foster 
              interdisciplinary interactions, and disseminate specialized  knowledge to a
              wide audience.
