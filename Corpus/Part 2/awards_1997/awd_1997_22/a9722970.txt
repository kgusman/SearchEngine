Abstract    :
              9722970   Luying Xun  The specific aims of this project are to study the
              biochemical pathways used to degrade two halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, the
              herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4,5-T), a derivative of
              2,4,5-trichlorophenol, and the biocide pentachlorophenol (PCP). The PI and
              collaborators have identified, purified, and characterized three enzymes
              involved in 2,4,5-T degradation by Burkholderia (Pseudormonas) cepacia strain
              AC 1100 and four enzymes involved in PCP degradation by Sphingomonas
              (Flavobacterium) sp.strain ATCC 39723, but this still leaves gaps in our
              knowledge of the pathways of both 2,4,5-T and PCP degradation. Both 2,4,5-T and
              PCP are first completely dehalogenated and converted to hydroxyquinol
              (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene) before ring-cleavage, but the dehalogenases involved
              in the two systems are very different. 2,4,5-T oxygenase oxidizes 2,4,5-T to
              2,4,5-trichlorophenol, which is oxidized by chlorophenol 4-monooxygenase to
              2,5- dichloro-p-hydroquinone and then to 5-chlorohydroxyquinol
              (5-chloro-1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene). A chlorine and a hydrogen are eliminated
              from 5-chlorohydroxyquinol by a newly identified enzyme to form
              hydroxybenzoquinone which is likely reduced to hydroxyquinol by a yet to be
              identified quinone reductase. PCP 4-monooxygenase oxidizes PCP to
              tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone, then tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone dehalogenase
              reductively dehalogenates tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone, first to
              2,3,6-trichloro-p-hydroquinone and then to 2,6-dichloro-p-hydroquinone.
              2,6-Dichloro-p-hydroquinone chlorohydrolase converts
              2,6-dichloro-p-hydroquinone to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol
              (6-chloro-1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene). It is unclear how 6-chlorohydroxyquinol is
              convened to hydroxyquinol, but a partially characterized dioxygenase oxidized
              only hydroxyquinol. This research will focus on the undocumented steps in these
              pathways. They will identify, purify and characterize the enzymes that catalyze
              undefined reactions involved in either 2,4,5-T or PCP degradation, as they have
              don e with other enzymes of these two systems. After a protein is purified, a
              partial amino acid sequence (probably from the N-terminus) will be determined.
              This sequence  will be used to clone the gene encoding each protein, either by
              identifying it as a gene known in another context or by using probes based on
              the amino acid sequence. This should allow us to more completely characterize
              each protein in order to understand the factors that might limit its activity. 
                Halogenated aromatic compounds have been released into the environment in
              large quantities as a result of their wide use as pesticides and herbicides and
              their production as byproducts of processes such as wood pulp bleaching.  They
              are a major group of environmental pollutants. They usually do not have
              counterparts in nature and often are very stable. Fortunately, some
              microorganisms can degrade these compounds and remove them from the
              environment. Few of the enzymes that catalyze step-by-step reactions to remove
              the halogens (chlorine, fluorine and bromine) to produce natural metabolic
              intermediates have been characterized. This research will discover novel
              enzymes and determine how microorganisms use these enzymes to degrade
              halogenated compounds.  This work may have important applications in
              bioremediation.
