Abstract    :
              INT 9722539  Rikoon      This U.S.-Czech project between J. Sandford Rikoon of
              the University of Missouri-Columbia and Miloslav Lapka of the Czech Institute
              of Landscape Ecology will feature a comparative analysis of the knowledge
              systems and knowledge communities of private farmers in two industrialized
              countries, the United States and the Czech Republic.  Efforts will emphasize a
              synthesis of sociocultural and political economy approaches with the intent of
              contributing to a comprehensive and syncretic understanding of human behaviors
              impacting on the landscape.    The overall collaboration will benefit from a
              multi-disciplinary, macro-level qualitative methodology employed by the Czechs
              and the U.S. participants' expertise in use of analytical tools such as
              geographic information systems for spatial representations of social, cultural,
              economic and environmental data.  To better understand intersections between
              ecological, social and economic systems, the researchers have chosen a
              watershed as the primary unit of analysis.  Results are expected to offer new
              insights into the dynamics associated with knowledge creation and may
              contribute to comparative methodologies for analyzing knowledge bases which, in
              this case, will pertain to human ecology.    This project in sociology fulfills
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
              experts in the Untied States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.     ??
