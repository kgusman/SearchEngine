Abstract    :
              9722726  Block    This Americas Program award will support travel and related 
              expenses for 9 U.S. scientists to participate in the "Latin  American Seminar
              in Biological Rhythms,"  to take place in  Puebla, Mexico,  August 31 to
              September 3, 1997.  Organizers are Dr. Gene Block, University of Virginia, and 
              Dr. Raul Aguilar-Roblero, Universidad Autonoma de Mexico.  The topic of the
              proposed meeting is circadian biology, and  the goals are to provide a forum
              for academic interactions  among U.S. and Latin American scientists interested
              in the  field of chronobiology;  to provide graduate students from 
              participating countries with the opportunity to interact  with established
              scientists; and to promote the exchange of  students. During the past two
              decades there has been a  tremendous growth in our understanding of biological
              timing.  Biological clocks play a critical role, not only in the  control of
              behavior and physiology, but also in the  measurement of daylength, and in
              solar orientation and  navigation by a number of species. In humans, few
              processes  escape the impact of timing systems.    The US participants are
              recognized for their contribution to  the study of biological rhythms and for
              their commitments to  the education of graduate students.  They represent 
              different areas of basic biological rhythms research,  ranging from the
              molecular level to behavior, and from  unicellular organisms to vertebrates.  
              A report on the main  conclusions of the sessions, with specific suggestions 
              related to joint research, the exchange of graduate  students, and development
              of a basic curriculum in  chronobiology graduate courses, will be submitted for
               publication in the Archives of Medical Research.  ***
