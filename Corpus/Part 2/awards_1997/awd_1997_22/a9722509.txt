Abstract    :
              9722509  Mohnen    This Americas Program award  will support a  collaborative
              research project between Dr. Debra  Mohnen, University of Georgia, and Dr.
              Ariel Orellana,  Universidad de Chile, to study pectin biosynthesis in  plants.
               Pectin is a polysaccharide of plant primary  wall that plays critical roles in
              plant growth and  development.  A full understanding of these roles  requires
              elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate  its biosynthesis.  The goal of the
              proposal is to  determine the topology of the pectin biosynthetic  enzyme, with
              the long term goal of elucidating, on a  molecular level, how pectin is
              synthesized.   In this  study, the researchers will try to identify enzymatic 
              activity, determine the topography of the enzyme, and  solubilize and purify
              enzymes.  The increased  understanding of their biochemistry, gained during the
               identification and purification process, will be  important for building
              accurate models of biosynthesis  of pectin.    The proposed collaboration 
              brings together two  complementary groups required to achieve the project's 
              objectives.  The US scientist's expertise in  biosynthesis of pectin
              complements Dr. Orellana's  experience in nucleotide sugar-transport and
              topography  of membrane proteins.  In addition to its importance to  plants,
              pectin is an important food fiber that  contributes to the roughage of fruits
              and vegetables,  and is an economically important gelling and  stabilizing
              agent in foods.  ***
