Abstract    :
              9722264  Oakley  Lipids are crucial components of many signal transduction
              pathways, specifically binding to target proteins and modulating their
              functions.  In spite of the biological importance of these interactions, the
              origin of specificity in protein-lipid interactions is not well understood. 
              This work will focus on the interaction between the actin-binding protein
              profilin and the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).  Binding
              by PIP2 to profilin is both specific and multivalent, with approximately five
              molecules of PIP2 binding to each molecule of protein.  To identify the
              determinants of specificity in the complex between profilin and PIP2 lipid
              assemblies, a branched, polymeric, covalent scaffold capable of presenting
              multiple copies of the headgroup from PIP2 will be used.  PIP2 headgroups and
              headgroup analogs will be attached to polymers of various sizes.  The effects
              on complex formation of the number of headgroups available for binding, the
              structure of the headgroups attached, and their spatial arrangement will be
              tested.  Furthermore, dendrimeric analogs containing spectroscopic probes of
              crosslinking moieties will be used to probe the protein binding site.  Such
              analogs will not only allow an exploration of the protein and lipid
              determinants of specificity, but will also be used to investigate the mechanism
              by which PIP2 modulates profilin function.    The cytoskeleton is a dynamic
              network of protein filaments that determines the shape of eukaryotic cells and
              can reorganize to allow directed cell motion in response to external stimuli. 
              The means by which external stimuli are transmitted to the cytoskeleton are
              incompletely understood.  Nonetheless, the lipid phosphatidylinositol
              4-5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is known to play a key role, binding to proteins that
              regulate filament formation in the cytoskeleton and modulating their functions.
               The purpose of this work is to gain a detailed understanding of the
              specificity of these protein-lipid interactions, providing too ls for further
              dissection of cytoskeletal signaling pathways.
