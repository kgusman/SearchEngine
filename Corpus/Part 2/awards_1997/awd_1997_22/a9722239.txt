Abstract    :
              9722239  Snoke    The proposed CAREER program combines research and teaching on 
              contemporary topics of modern optics, or "photonics."  The  proposed
              experimental research examines the spontaneous  appearance of optical phase
              coherence due to excitonic long-range  order.  The phase transition of excitons
              to spontaneous  coherence, which is exactly analogous to Bose condensation of 
              atoms, will be studied in two and three dimensions, namely, in  semiconductor
              quantum wells and in bulk semiconductors.  The  proposed teaching program
              involves creating a photonics  curriculum which prepares students for the
              growing job market in  optics and bioengineering, including tpaining in
              techniques such  as time-resolved spectroscopy and acousto-optic modulation, as
               well as introductory courses which make modern physics more  accessible to
              students of all kinds.  %%%  The proposed CAREER program combines research and
              teaching on  contemporary topics of modern optics, or "photonics." The 
              proposed research centers on novel physical effects of  "excitons," which are
              essentially photons in an optical medium  which act as though they have mass. 
              Under proper experimental  conditions, these "heavy and slow photons" can
              self-organize into  a coherent wave with a wavelength hundreds of times less
              than  ordinary light.  The proposed program of teaching involves  working with
              other members of the University of Pittsburgh to  create a photonics curriculum
              which prepares students for the  growing job market in optics and
              bioengineering, as well as  introductory courses which make modern physics more
              accessible to  students of all kinds.  ***
