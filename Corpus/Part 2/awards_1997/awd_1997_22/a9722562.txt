The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of two US
              supported  experiments to be built at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
              primary physics goal of CMS is to discover the origin of electroweak symmetry
              breaking. To that end, the basic philosophy of CMS is to enclose the tracking
              and calorimetry
inside a strong Solenoidal magnet. This design allows for a
              Compact design allowing optimal Muon detection without compromise to the
              electromagnetic calorimetry because of inert material. In general CMS is
              optimized for detection of electrons, photons, muons, neutrinos and jets.  The
              Standard Model predicts the existence of the Higgs Particle, the missing
              component of the model.   Reconstruction of the Higgs decay modes predicted by
              theStandard Model requires excellent lepton detection. At the highluminosities
              to be used at the LHC, the lepton of choice is the muon due to its relatively
              clean signature.  There are about 1500 physicists in the CMS Collaboration who
              plan to build the detector. The detector is to be constructed from 1998 until
              data taking in mid 2005. The composition of CMS is roughly 50% physicists from
              member states, 25% from Russia and other non member states, and 25% US groups. 
              During 1994 a US CMS Collaboration of about 320 physicists and engineers from
              40 institutions (4 national labs) was formed. The collective goal of this group
              is to pursue high energy physics at the highest energy frontier which will be
              available at LHC.
Their  experience on previous hadron collider experiments at
              Fermilab and CERN and on the R&D associated with the SSC makes it possible for
              US physicists to have a major impact on the design of CMS. They have been
              assigned distinct and coherent managerial and construction responsibilities.
              including the management  for the hadron calorimetry (HCAL), the endcap muon
              system (EMU), the trigger system (TRIG), construction responsibilities in
              electron calorimetry (ECAL), tracking, data acquisition (DAQ) and computing and
              software.  The present design of the HCAL barrel and the EMU are the result of
              US CMS redesigning those parts of the detector.  CMS has appointed, in addition
              to detector coordinators, an education coordinator who, with a CMS  education
              task  group, intends to develop a sustained  program integrating research and
              education.
