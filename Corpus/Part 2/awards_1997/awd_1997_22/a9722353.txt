Abstract    :
              9722353  Stewart  Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) combined with
              three-dimensional image reconstruction techniques provides a powerful way to
              examine the structure of large macromolecular assemblies.  Specific research
              objectives include cryo-EM studies of the ribonucleoprotein vault particle and
              alpha-crystallin, a molecular chaperone.  Vault studies will include a
              three-dimensional reconstruction of the intact particle, difference imaging
              analysis with ribonuclease treated particles to reveal the location of the
              internal RNA, and structural mapping using truncated forms of the major vault
              protein.  Alpha-crystallin studies will include reconstruction of native and
              cross-linked recombinant human (B crystallin multimers and (B crystallin
              complexed with lactalbumin, a large target protein.  Specific educational
              objectives include: mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral fellows,
              strengthening multi-departmental graduate education at UCLA, and volunteering
              in science outreach programs for minority and high school students.    Cryo-EM
              often represents the only feasible structural approach for large (1-400 million
              Dalton) complexes if the sample has proven resistant to crystallization, as
              have both the vault and alpha-crystallin.  Thus these studies will enable
              structure/function analysis of a ribonucleoprotein particle conserved across
              species as diverse as humans and the slime mold Dictyostelium, and provide
              insight into the quaternary structure of alpha-crystallin and its mechanism of
              action in binding partially denatured proteins.  Integration of the research
              and educational goals will be accomplished by teaching novel structural methods
              such as cryo-EM and image reconstruction to upper level undergraduates and
              graduate students, as well as mentoring graduate students in the laboratory.
