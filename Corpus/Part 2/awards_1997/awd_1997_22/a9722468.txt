Abstract    :
                   A Toroidal Large Apertune Spectrometer (ATLAS) is a  general-purpose
              detector that will exploit the full  potential of the Large Hadron Collider
              (LHC) proton-proton  collision program.  The LHC will provide 10 times higher 
              center-of-mass energy and 1000 times higher proton-proton  collision rates than
              previous colliders.  This opens up new  frontiers of physics which ATLAS will
              explore.  The Standard  Model, which is the established theoretical description
              of  the basic building blocks of matter and of the fundamental  interactions,
              has several unexplored aspects, all well  within the reach of ATLAS.  ATLAS
              will greatly increase the  resolving power with which the size of the building
              blocks  of matter, the quarks and leptons, can be measured.       The discovery
              of the Z and W particles was a large step  forward in the understanding of
              fundamental interactions.  ATLAS will be able to discover and measure particles
              with  similar properties but with masses up to 50 times larger  than those of
              the W and Z.  ATLAS is designed for a large  discovery potential and for
              precision measurements.       The detector designs are based on extensive R&D
              within  the collaboration and display many innovative features.  Over a period
              of six years, prototypes of progressively  increasing scale, together with
              simulations, have been used  to optimize the performance to meet the ATLAS
              requirements.       An international collaboration of 1500 scientists, from 
              145 institutes in 31 countries, including 250 physicists  from 28 US
              institutions, will construct and use the ATLAS  detector.       ATLAS has, in
              addition to detector coordinators, an  education coordinator who, with an ATLAS
              education task  group, intends to develop a significant program integrating 
              research and education.
