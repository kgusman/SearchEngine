Abstract    :
              9731513  Mulchandani  This project is to develop a novel approach for the
              biodegradation of organophosphorous nerve agents based on the application of
              "live" biocatalysts with organophosphorous hydrolase (OPH) and cellulose
              binding domain protein (CPD) displayed onto the cell surface in immobilized
              cell bioreactors, and to demonstrate the feasibility of using this technology
              for large-scale detoxification of nerve agents.  Specific objectives are to: 1)
              Illustrate that the coexpression of OPH and CPD onto the cell surface affords
              very tight binding of the live biocatalysts to cellulosic materials; 2)
              Determine the optimal ratio of surface-displayed OPH and CPD for detoxification
              and immobilization; 3) Select the appropriate cellulose immobiliztion matrix
              for immobilizing large numbers of OPH expressing cells tightly and for use in a
              flow through immobilized cell biorector; and 4) Develop batch and continuous
              immobilized cell bioreactorsbaed on the optimized "live" biocatalysts and
              selected cellulose immobilization supports for detoxification of
              organophosphate nerve agents.  ***
