Abstract    :
              9731209  Fabien  This award supports ten US participants in the US-South Africa
              Workshop on Mechanical Engineering Design Education, which will be held in
              Johannesburg, South Africa, in July 1998.  The co-organizers are Professor
              Brian Fabien, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington,
              and Professor Andrew Dickson, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The
              University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.  The purpose of the workshop is
              to establish a long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between
              university-level design engineering educators in both countries.  Participants
              will be drawn from academia and industry and will include senior educators as
              well as postdoctoral and/or junior investigators and graduate students. 
              Through a series of presentations and interactive sessions, the participants
              will discuss current practices in graduate level teaching of engineering design
              and state of the art use of multimedia in engineering education, including
              distance learning and real-time computer usage in the classroom.  This latter
              topic is especially important for South Africa, where distance learning forms a
              large part of higher education.  Special emphasis will be placed on
              undergraduate teaching methodologies and effectiveness measures, with the aim
              of presenting a variety of innovative current approaches to design education. 
              Site visits to academic institutions and local industry will take place during
              the workshop, and industry representatives will give their perspectives on
              hiring requirements for design engineering graduates.  The workshop is being
              supported jointly by the Division of Design, Manufacture, and Industrial
              Innovation (DMII), the Design of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), and
              the Division of International Programs (INT).  ***
