Abstract    :
              9731459  SHAAR     This project will support shipboard scientific support
              equipment for the research vessel GYRE operated by Texas A & M University and
              dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.     The Shipboard
              Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed
              essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This
              Program provides support  for such items as deck equipment including winch
              systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments,
              navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers
              to pin point the location of research sites, communication equipment including
              radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
              scientists to and from data retrieval sites.          The Project Director,
              Edwin Shaar is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable
              experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard
              equipment.          This project will allow the institution to acquire two air
              tugger winches, an outboard motor and a marine sanitation device.  ***
