Abstract    :
              9727245  Page    This collaborative research team employs computational and
              mathematical models to improve an understanding of the nature and performance
              of decentralized political systems.  The project has two principal goals.  The
              first is to understand better the advantages and disadvantages of different
              institutional arrangements in federal political systems.  More specifically,
              the investigators study the effects of different degrees of power-sharing and
              coordination among central and local governments.  The methodological goal is
              to continue extending and analyzing computational models as a methodology in
              political science and the social sciences in general.    In federal systems,
              there are several layers of institutions, including those in the central
              government, those that specify relations between the central government and
              local governments, and those that decide policies at the local level.  The
              basic idea behind the project is that a federal system as a whole (a country or
              an international organization like the European Union) can benefit when local
              jurisdictions develop innovative policies, yet incentives for policy
              experimentation are not independent of institutions set up at the system-wide
              level or at the local level.  The researchers analyze closely models that
              incorporate institutions resembling those in two federal systems, the United
              States and the European Union.    ***
