Abstract    :
                Henry  9727835        The physical factors in an organism's environment often
              exert pressure  on the organism to evolve specific physiological responses 
              (adaptations) in order to survive in and exploit that environment. One  of the
              richest aquatic environments is the estuary, with high  concentrations of
              nutrients and low numbers of competing species.  However, estuaries are harsh
              and hostile with respect to their primary  physical characteristic, low and
              fluctuating salinity. Estuarine  species have evolved specific mechanisms for
              survival in low salinity.  Specifically, they have the ability to take up salt
              (Na and C1 ions)  from the ambient water into their blood, thus allowing them
              to maintain  fairly constant blood and tissue concentrations even in the face
              of  highly variable environmental salt concentrations. This is accomplished 
              through the action of specific salt-transport enzymes, the Na/K ATPase  and
              carbonic anhydrase. The levels of these enzymes are induced in low  salinity,
              but the process of induction is unknown. The focus of this  research is the
              mechanism by which an organism perceives a salinity  change and transduces that
              into the selective induction of transport  enzymes.
