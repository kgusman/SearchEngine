Abstract    :
              Humphrey  9727180      The  Symposium  will  bring  together  a  highly 
              interdisciplinary  mix  of  biologists,  physical scientists (chemists,
              physicists, mathematicians)  and  engineers  to  present  and  discuss fluid-, 
              solid-,  them~o-mechanics  and  dynamics  phenomena related to plants, animals,
              and their environments.  The  length  scale range of interest spans single
              cells, to entire organisms,  to  their  host  environments, implying length
              scale ratios exceeding  10'2  and  including     the    extremes    of    micro
                 (molecular)    and     macro  (atmosphericJoceanographic) forces.    Many 
              disparate  phenomena are described by a common set of  physical  laws.  They
              include the breaking of a limb from a tree, the lifting of a load by an  ant, 
              the  sensing  of vibrations by a spider, the dispersion  of  seeds  or 
              chemical  pollutants  by  the wind, the flight of  birds  and  insects,  the 
              swimming  of fish, the transportation of oxygen via blood cells, the  rising 
              of  sap in trees, the hot chemical discharge from the bombardier beetle, the 
              solar  radiation  interception by a butterfly's  wings,  the  dispersal  and 
              sensing  of  pheromone plumes in moths, the locomotion of water striders  on 
              water  surfaces, filter feeding in marine animals, insect sound  production, 
              the  mechanics  of  single  cells and their  membranes  and  skeletons,  the 
              physico-chemicai  properties  of arthropod exoskeletons,  the  mechanics  of 
              blood  flow  through large blood vessels and in capillaries, the  optima  of 
              certain  organismal forms in relation to function. This provides  a  natural 
              way  to  analyze  a  diverse collection of biological phenomena  that  might 
              otherwise:  appear totally unrelated; a way to find underlying commonalities 
              among  them,  not in the traditional biological areas, but in terms  of  the 
              physics that affect them in their environments.
