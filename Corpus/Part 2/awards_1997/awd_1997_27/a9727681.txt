Abstract    :
              Dybas  9727681    A major issue in ecological and evolutionary physiology is the
               relationship among the traits of complex organisms, organisms'  ability to
              exploit diverse environments, and species'  persistence in time. The proposed
              investigation examines the  heat-shock protein Hsp70 in Drosophila to address
              this issue.  In response to heat or other stresses, nearly all organisms 
              express heat-shock proteins (Hsps), highly-conserved proteins  that contribute
              to stress tolerance by functioning as molecular  chaperones. Research supported
              by a previous NSF award has  established that experimental manipulation of copy
              number of  the hsp70 gene of Drosophila, which encodes Hsp70, is  sufficient to
              cause changes in thermotolerance. The proposed  research will build upon this
              finding to examine the  physiological mechanism of Hsp70 function; i.e., how
              thermal  stress disrupts function and how Hsp70 protects against heat  damage
              or aids recovery from it. This issue will be examined in  the larval gut of
              Drosophila, which is especially susceptible  to heat damage. Electron
              microscopy will be used to determine  which particular tissues and cells are
              most vulnerable to heat  damage, and to document protection of these tissues
              and cells  by the heat-shock protein Hsp70. Larval Drosophila that differ  in
              Hsp70 expression will be examined. The projected outcome of  the proposed
              research has immense potential to integrate  molecular, genetic, functional,
              and evolutionary perspectives  to advance understanding of adaptation.
