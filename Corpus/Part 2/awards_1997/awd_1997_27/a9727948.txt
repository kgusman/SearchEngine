Abstract    :
              9727948  Sension  In this research project state-of-the-art ultrafast
              spectroscopic techniques will be used to study the primary electron transfer
              processes in photosystem II.  Three specific lines of attack will be pursued in
              this series of investigations. (1) Ultrafast fluorescence detection will be
              used to study the excited state population dynamics directly in the D1-D2-Cyt
              b559 reaction center complex.  A streak camera of novel design, which provides
              greater flexibility, superior signal averaging and sub five picosecond time
              resolution, will be used.  These characteristics are necessary for the study of
              energy transfer and change separation in PSII. (2)  Larger PSII complexes will
              be prepared in order to study the electron transfer rate in active centers and
              set to rest any speculation as to whether or not the D1-D2-Cyt b559 complex
              retains the native reaction center structure and dynamics.  The studies will
              investigate the D1-D2-Cyt b559 complex, the CP47-D1-D2-Cyt b559 complex, and
              the reaction center core under consistent conditions permitting direct and
              quantitative comparisons. (3) Finally, the addition of external replacement
              quinones will be used to study the primary and secondary electron transfer
              processes in PSII.  These measurements will be performed on the D1-D2-Cyt b559
              complex and the CP47-D1-D2-Cyt b559 complex.  These studies will explore the
              effect of the presence of a secondary electron acceptor on the population
              equilibrium distributed over the locally excited fluorescent and charge
              separated dark states.  A rigorous understanding of the primary electron
              transfer reactions in biological photosynthetic systems is one of the keys to a
              complete understanding of natural solar energy conversion.  The protein complex
              referred to as photosystem II is responsible for the ability of green plants to
              utilize light energy to fuel the production of oxygen from water.  The PSII
              protein complex works in conjunction with a second complex, photosystem 1, to
              form carbohydrates from carbon  dioxide.  From a chemical point of view, the
              ability of green plants to produce oxygen and carbohydrates from light, water
              and carbon dioxide represents an amazing achievement.  The overall goal of this
              investigation is to understand the factors that control the efficiency of
              photosynthesis in green plants.
