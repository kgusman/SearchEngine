Abstract    :
              9727401  Kaplan  The objective of this project is to gain new insights into the
              interactions between the primary sequence of a protein and the influence of the
              surrounding environment on protein conformation and self-assembly.  The
              manipulation of interfacial chemistry, coupled with the control of the primary
              sequence of fibrous proteins, may provide new information on the key factors
              responsible for the formation of secondary and higher order structures in
              proteins.  Recent results indicate that the conformation and higher order
              structures generated by the fibrous protein, silk fibroin, can be significantly
              influenced by the surrounding environment, self-assembling into crystal
              structures and oriented textures as well as mesophases, depending on the
              environment imposed.  The potential implications from this project are
              significant in areas of protein patterning, the use of proteins as templates
              for secondary nucleation of other proteins or for inorganic materials, and in
              the control of macroscopic materials properties such as permeation and other
              transport phenomena.  ***
