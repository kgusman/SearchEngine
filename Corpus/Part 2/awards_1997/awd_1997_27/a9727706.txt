Abstract    :
              9727706  Coe    This grant provides partial support to the University of 
              Californa-Santa Cruz for the costs of upgrading superconducting  rock
              magnetometer (SRM) and building an in-line alternating field  (AF)
              demagnetizer.  The current SRM at UC-Santa Cruz was  purchased in 1985, the
              third SRM ever built by 2G enterprises.  It suffers from repeated freezing
              blockages within the liquid  helium plumbing lines, rapid liquid He boil-off
              rate and an order  of magnitude lower sensitivity than currently available on
              state-  of-the-art SRM's equipped with DC SQUIDs.  2-G Enterprises will 
              refurbish this SRM with DC SQUIDs and with improvements in the  plumbing and
              thermal design that will both reduce operating costs  and increase safety.  The
              AF demagnetizer will be built in-house.    The increased sensitivity afforded
              paleomagnetic investigations  through addition of DC SQUIDS will improve the
              reliability of  paleomagnetic declinations and inclinations calculated for
              weakly  magnetized rocks and sediments.  Funded tectonic studies in  southern
              Asia and the eastern California shear zone will  immediately benefit from this
              upgrade.  Furthermore, the  capabilities of an in-line AF demagnetizer will
              enable  elimination of secondary component magnetizations in samples that  have
              been struck by lighting and will prove useful for  paleointensity measurements
              made on Miocene flood basalts from  Steens Mountain and early Cretaceous flood
              basalts from the  Parana Basin in Brazil.  These measurements are crucial for 
              understanding past variations in the geomagnetic field.  ***
