Abstract    :
                   9727350        The Division of Medical Sciences is a part of Harvard 
              University that supervises Ph.D. training programs of the  Graduate School of
              Arts and Sciences for students who are  engaged in basic biological research in
              laboratories on the  Medical school campus. The Division will conduct a 1O-week
               summer research program for undergraduate students to  participate in research
              projects in the field of microbial  biochemistry and genetic regulation. In
              addition to their  research projects, students participate in a weekly student 
              faculty research discussion seminar series at which they  teach other about
              their projects, and in a weekly career  development series, which covers such
              topics as choosing  graduate programs, completing successful applications, and 
              interviewing. Three sessions each summer are devoted to  discussions of ethical
              issues in biological sciences.  Students will be recruited from a nation wide
              pool, with a  particular emphasis recruiting students who are interested  in
              careers in biological research and on recruiting  qualified minority students
              and women. Students will have  the opportunity to carry out projects in the
              laboratories of  any of 18 Division faculty members who are participating in 
              this program.         Students will also have opportunities to meet other 
              majority and minority research faculty and graduate students  in both academic
              and social settings. These opportunities  are provided by the program, by the
              individual laboratories,  and by the housing accomodations, which are in the
              dormitory  on the Medical School campus. Students receive a stipend,  housing,
              travel to and from program, and health insurance  for emergency illness and
              accidents.
