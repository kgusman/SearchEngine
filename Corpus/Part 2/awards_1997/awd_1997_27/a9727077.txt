Abstract    :
              9727077  SMITH  The annual expansion and contraction of ice cover in the 
              Southern Ocean is the largest seasonal process in the World  Ocean. This
              seasonal variability in ice cover creates  extensive fluctuations in primary
              production, which heavily  impacts pelagic and benthic communities. This
              research will  initiate a long time-series study of the water column and  sea
              floor using long-term, autonomous monitoring and  sampling systems developed
              for use in the Antarctic. The  study will be located in Post Foster, Deception
              Island,  which supports a pelagic and benthic fauna representative of  the
              Antarctic coastal zone and experiences seasonal ice  cover. A bottom-moored,
              upward-looking acoustic instrument  will be deployed on the sea floor for a
              period of one year  to monitor the vertical distribution, abundance and biomass
               of acoustically-detectable macrozooplankton and micronekton  in the water
              column. Collections will be made over this  period using a newly-developed
              vertically-profiling pump  sampling. Simultaneously, a time-lapse camera system
              will be  moored on the sea floor to monitor the spatial distribution,  sizes
              and movements of the epibenthic megafauna component of  the benthic community.
              The instrumentation development will  allow the research project to focus on
              the effect of the  seasonal sea ice cycle on the distribution, abundance and 
              biomass of the macrozooplankton and micronekton in the water  column. Similar
              questions on the distribution, abundance,  size and movements of the epibenthic
              megafauna will be  addressed. Results from this study will provide a valuable 
              data base for the evaluation of the pelagic and benthic  community responses to
              seasonal variability in the Southern  Ocean.
