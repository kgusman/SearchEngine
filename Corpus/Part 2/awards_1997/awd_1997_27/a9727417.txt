Abstract    :
              Dr Michael T. Pope, Chemistry Department, Georgetown University, is   supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program,  to
              investigate the chemistry of polyoxometalate species.  This   research is
              directed towards developing robust, water-stable,   functionalized organic
              derivatives of (a) polytungstate anions containing   10-30 tungsten atoms and
              one to several other atom types that can be used   as sites of further
              derivatization and (b) massive, soluble discrete   polyoxoanions of nanoscale
              dimensions that contain 100+ metal atoms. The   ability to derivatize rhodium
              containing type (a) complexes at the   rhodium will be used to couple the
              polyoxometalate to ribosomes for   phasing of x-ray data. Additional type (a)
              species will be prepared with   multiple sites for derivatization. These
              species can be utilized for   supporting agents to attach catalytically active
              polyoxoanions to polymer   substrates, for selective electron-density imaging,
              and other   applications. Type (b) complexes are exemplified by a 76- anion  
              containing 12 As, 16 Ln, 148 W, and 524 O atoms plus 36 water molecules.   This
              anion is water soluble and has been crystallographically   characterized.
              Synthetic strategies will be designed for analogues of   this species in which
              As is substituted by other group 15 atoms and for   those that contain a
              variety of lanthanides. The preparation of even   larger clusters will be
              devised. The hydrolytic stability, structures,   electrochemistry and other
              properties will be investigated in solution    for these large anions. Methods
              will be designed to couple these clusters   anions into designed, extended
              assemblies.  The polyoxometalates are a large ions composed of metal and 
              oxygen   atoms. They are of interest because they are wholly inorganic, and
              thus   should be quite robust under many conditions. This investigation will  
              explore the chemistry of two classes of these ions. The first contains   10-30
              metal atoms  and has centers that can be linked to other chemical   species.
              The second class is composed of very massive ions that contain   hundreds of
              atoms and are nano-sized. Both classes are unusual for   because they dissolve
              in and are stable in water. They  have potential   applications as ion-exchange
              and host/guest materials, catalysts,   conducting and magnetic materials, and
              display devices.
