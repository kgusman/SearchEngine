Abstract    :
              In recent years a large proportion of minority males have experienced direct
              involvement with the criminal justice system. This project involves the
              dissertation research of an anthropology student from Yale University, studying
              the social costs of incarceration in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington DC,
              where over 40% of the black men are estimated to be under some form of
              correctional supervision-parole, probation, drug rehabilitation, etc., on any
              given day.  The project will study the effects of the prison incarceration of
              young minority males on their own reinvolvement in the community after their
              release, and on their families, while they are in custody and after they come
              out.  In addition the study will analyze the local discourse on race and local
              perceptions of the morality of the criminal justice system.  The method will be
              general participant observation in the neighborhood as well as formal
              interviews with local police, lawyers, ministers, public officials and
              residents.  A set of interviews will be conducted with families with no
              experience with the criminal justice system as well as those with currently
              incarcerated members.  The student will focus on resource sharing and networks
              of support of the families as they cope with the absence of a member.  This
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of the effects
              of increased incarceration rates in inner city neighborhoods.  The new
              information will be valuable to policy makers trying to ameliorate the negative
              impact of incarceration on households and communities.
