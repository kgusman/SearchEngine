Abstract    :
              9726319  Jones    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Function and Dynamics of Plant  Vacuoles, to be held
              in Hawaii from January 11-14, l999.  The co-organizers are Professors Russell
              Jones of the  University of California at Berkeley and Kenzo Nakamura of 
              Nagoya University in Japan.  The seminar will focus on the  biogenesis,
              structure and function of vacuoles.  It will  bring together biochemists, and
              cell and molecular  biologists who work with vacuoles.  The emphasis will be on
               vacuoles in higher plants but vacuoles in baker's yeast will  also be
              discussed.    Research on biochemistry, and cell and molecular biology of 
              vacuoles is presently very dynamic.  Researchers are  beginning to understand
              the complexities surrounding the  biogenesis of vacuoles in plants and yeast
              and the  mechanisms of targeting macromolecules to this compartment.  Rapid
              progress is also being made in identifying and  characterizing tonoplast
              transporters.  New pumps and  channels on the tonoplast are being described,
              and the role  of these transport molecules in cellular homeostasis is 
              beginning to be understood.  It is anticipated that the  researchers will be
              able to discuss and resolve current  controversy and disagreement about many
              aspects of vacuole  structure and function.  Seminar organizers have made a 
              special effort to involve younger researchers.  The exchange  of ideas and data
              with Japanese experts in this field will  enable U.S. participants to advance
              their own work, and will  set the stage for future collaborative projects.  ***
