Abstract    :
              Hellen  MCB 9726958  1. Technical   Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G
              coordinates the rate-limiting step in   protein synthesis by interacting with
              other factors in the recruitment of mRNA to ribosomes. eIF4G associates with
              the cap-binding protein eIF4E and the ATPase/RNA helicase eIF4A to form the
              eIF4F complex.  eIF4G also binds to eIF3, a component of the 43S ribosomal
              preinitiation complex. This study applies biochemical and molecular genetic
              approaches to characterize the role of eIF4G' in initiation of translation. 
              This is achieved through reconstitution experiments in vitro using purified
              components, which include recombinant eIFs 4A, 4B, 4E and 4G, on a variety of
              clone mRNAs.  Sensitive toe-printing and footprinting methods to map the
              position of ribosomal and preinitiation complexes on mRNAs are developed for
              this purpose. The significance of this study lies in its advancing our
              knowledge of protein synthesis at the molecular level.  2. Non Technical  This
              study is to elucidate fundamental aspects of the mechanism and regulation of
              protein synthesis, particularly the role of the initiation factor, 4G (eIF4G),
              in coordinating the activities of various cellular components that together
              recruit individual mRNAs for the onset of translation. Experimentally, purified
              components on different mRNAs are reconstituted in vitro at the beginning stage
              of translation. Various protein or mRNA components are systematically
              substituted with a series of variants, and their effects compared under
              specific conditions such as growth arrest and mitosis. The importance of
              determinants in eIF4G that enable it to bind to all mRNAs nonspecifically, and
              to a few with high specificity, are identified and characterized. Viral and
              cellular mRNAs that bind eIF4G with high affinity are chosen in this study,
              since they may be models for translation when eIF4E is inactive.  Also being
              studied are determinants of eIF4A's which interact with eIF4G, another
              initiation factor. This interaction directs the unwinding  of eIF4A to a
              specific site on the mRNA to permit the attachment of ribosomes, the anchorage
              machinery for protein synthesis.
