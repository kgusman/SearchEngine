Abstract    :
              9726024  Hamburger  This collaborative proposal (Indiana University and UCAR)
              seeks funds to support a study of crustal deformation associated with magmatic
              activity on two active volcanoes in the Philippines, Pinatubo and Taal.  The
              two volcanoes offer an opportunity to examine magma dynamics associated with
              two neighboring, but very distinct volcanic systems - an explosive,
              subduction-related, dacitic stratovolcano (Pinatubo) and an extensional
              basaltic-andesitic volcano complex (TAAL).  The PIs will use precise
              measurements of vertical and horizontal movements of the Earth's crust using
              state-of-the-art Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, including a
              newly developed, low-cost, single-frequency volcanic monitoring system
              currently in development by C0-PI Meertens.  This proposal requests funds for
              data collection and analysis; funds for the GPS instrumentation are requested
              in a second, companion proposal to the NSF instrumentation & Facilities
              program.   Among the principal scientific objectives of the project are:   (1)
              improved understanding of the magmatic systems associated with active volcanic
              processes at the two volcanoes; (2) analysis of long-term post-eruptive
              processes in the aftermath of Pinatubo's cataclysmic volcanic eruption of 1991;
              (3) refined spatial control on magma movement (at Taal) via development of a
              real-time volcanic monitoring system; (4) identification of spatial and
              temporal interactions between tectonic structures and volcanic systems - the
              Philippine Fault in the case of Pinatubo, and the Marikina Fault for Taal; and
              (5) development and testing of new, state-of-the-art crustal deformation
              measurement systems for volcanic monitoring.  These include use of real-time
              kinematic (RTK) measurements along dense profiles on the volcanoes flanks, and
              a first field test of newly developed, single-frequency GPS volcanic monitoring
              system.   Specifically, the PIs research plan includes the following
              experiments:  (1) high-precision (sub-cm accuracy) static GPS meas urements at
              Pinatubo, Taal, and fault-monitoring networks around the Philippines and
              Marikina faults (Year 1);  (2) lower-precision (1-2 cm accuracy) RTK
              measurements along dense profiles on the two volcanoes (Year 1); (3)
              development of a continuous, three-station, real-time telemetered,
              high-precision (dual-frequency) GPS network around Taal Volcano (Year 1);  (4)
              analysis of data from static and real-time networks using Bernese software; (5)
               installation and field testing of a 10-station array of single-frequency,
              cm-level-precision GPS stations around Taal (Year 2); and  (6) analysis of data
              from the dual and single-frequency networks, and comparison with a parallel
              system in development by colleagues at the University of Savoie (Years 2-3).
