Abstract    :
              Polak   9726903    The goals of the proposed work are to elucidate the
              mechanistic and genetic bases of resistance against parasitism in an insect
              host.  Previous ecological research has shown that the parasite (a macrochelid
              mite) damages multiple reproductive traits of its host (a drosophilid fly),
              providing the rationale for asking specific questions about the evolutionary
              potential of parasitism in this natural system.  Laboratory experiments, using
              genetically distinct resistant and control lines of flies and integrated
              behavioral and physiological techniques, are proposed to determine (1) the
              magnitude of genetic variability underlying resistance in the natural host
              population, (2) constraints on the evolution of resistance, (3) effects of loss
              of genetic variability (through controlled host inbreeding) on rates of
              parasitism, and (4) traits of the host that confer resistance.    Most of what
              is known about patterns of genetic variability in resistance against parasites
              and pathogens, and their effect on the distribution of disease in nature, comes
              from studies of plants and their natural enemies. Only by acquiring the
              requisite information in animal hosts can we begin to develop a general theory
              of the evolution of parasite resistance, and sound approaches to disease
              control.  The proposed study is aimed at attaining this goal using an
              insect-ectoparasite model whose ecology is well known. The results should have
              broad-ranging implications because ectoparasites are ubiquitous, are know
              vectors or transmissible parasitic disease in numerous species, and because the
              mechanisms expected to mediate susceptibility to ectoparasitism in the present
              system have strong parallels with that in other taxa including birds, mammals
              and other invertebrates.
