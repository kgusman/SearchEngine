              ABSTRACT    Proposal Title:  Role of Acid Sites in the Selective Reduction of NO
                  by Methane over Pd-Based Catalysts in the Presence      of Excess Oxygen 
              Proposal Number: CTS-9726465  Principal Investigator Daniel E. Resasco 
              Institution:  University of Oklahoma    Professor Daniel E. Resasco, from the
              University of Oklahoma, will investigate various aspects of the selective
              catalytic reduction of NO with methane in the presence of oxygen, over Pd on
              acidic supports. This work is of relevance to various environmental concerns:
              it provides new scientific insights into the catalytic removal of NOx from
              gases of combustion, it leads to the utilization of methane, it leads to the
              possibility of burning fuels under leaner (oxygen-rich) conditions, and as a
              consequence, it allows higher energy efficiency and less generation of CO2 per
              unit of energy production. Three objectives will be pursued: to determine the
              role of acidic sites in providing SCR selectivity to Pd supported or exchanged
              in zeolites or supported on sulfated zirconia; to determine the possible
              reaction mechanisms kinetically, by infrared spectroscopy of reactants or
              possible intermediates, and by transient kinetics of isotopically labeled
              compounds; and to investigate the tolerance of the Pd catalysts during reaction
              in the presence of water and SO2. The state of Pd will be characterized by
              x-ray absorption, temperature programmed reduction, electron microscopy, and
              chemisorption of probe molecules. The acidic sites will be characterized by
              microcalorimetry and by chemisorption and temperature programmed desorption of
              weak bases.
