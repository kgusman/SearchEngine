Abstract    :
              9709394  Reed  The Pacific Northwest has been subjected to a series of 
              crippling storms in late 1996 and early 1997.  A combination  of wind, ice,
              rain and snow have contributed to the shutdown  of the region's lifelines in
              transportation, communications  and electric power.  Flooding and mudslides
              associated with  the storm's aftermath are still underway.  This series of 
              events presents a unique opportunity to gather data for  investigation of
              lifeline systems failures.  The primary  objective of this work is to analyze
              the chain of events  involving power and other systems failures, through
              detailed  investigations of the following: meteorological conditions  and
              chronology; local utility data from Puget Power, Seattle  City Light and
              others; collection of data in the field by  the principal investigator,
              graduate research assistant and  others; and reports of the news media.  It is
              also planned  to establish a website asking for data from the greater 
              community as well.  Another objective is to develop  recommendations for damage
              mitigation and increased system  robustness with the goal of reducing losses.
