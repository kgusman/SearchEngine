              In this research three related projects are conducted. In each project, the
              design and analysis  of various mechanisms are carried out for different
              classes of matching problems.  In the first project two notions of manipulation
              are formulated for centralized two-  sided matching markets (Gale & Shapley
              (1962)). Matching activities both before and after  thee centralized market are
              often observed in these markets.  Notions of manipulation via  withholding
              positions and manipulation via pre-arranged matches are introduced and 
              unraveling behavior is justified from an incentives point of view. Environments
              yielding manipulation opportunities are analyzed and two prominent mechanisms
              are evaluated based on their vulnerability to manipulation.  In the second
              project a mechanism es proposed for the allocation of housing.  Various
              properties of this mechanism are studied (including its efficiency and fairness
              properties) and its axiomatic characterizations are obtained.  A wider class of
              problems which captures some real life complications in the allocation of 
              housing is introduced, and our proposed mechanism are extended to this wider  c
              lass.  In the third project a new class of matching problems that models
              centralized college  admissions via standardized tests is introduced and a
              mechanism that is used in some  real life applications is studied. An
              alternative mechanism based on the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm
              is proposed and is shown to be the only `reasonable` mechanism based on its
              efficiency and fairness properties.
