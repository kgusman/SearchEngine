Abstract    :
              9709308  Taylor  The collections presently housed by the Paleontological
              Research Institution (PRI) contain more than two and a half million specimens;
              they are among the largest and scientifically most important invertebrate
              paleontology collections in the United States. These collections, however, had
              been allowed to deteriorate and had been essentially inaccessible to the
              research and educational communities for many years. In 1992, a major
              reorganization and renovation effort was begun that continued after 1994 with
              NSF support. The chief results of this effort to date have been the
              resuscitation of the PRI collection and the transfer to PRI of the invertebrate
              fossil and Recent mollusk collections of Cornell University (CU). Condition of
              and accessibility to these collections has now significandy improved and use
              accordingly has greafiy increased. This award will support the next phase of
              this process of renewal. Two-thirds of the CU collection is stored in temporary
              trailers in the back yard of the Institution; these will be rehoused in new,
              permanent storage facilities in order to make them useful once again to the
              scientific community. PRI's type and figured collection and the microfossil
              collection will also be rehoused and curated in preparation for
              computerization. During the spring of 1997, the Institution will be
              constructing approximately 4,000 square feet of new collections space as
              cost-sharing with the NSF on this project.
