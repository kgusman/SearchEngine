Abstract    :
              Sarah C. Rutan is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program in
              the Chemistry Division to perform studies aimed at developing   a better
              understanding of solvation in condensed phases through the use   of
              spectroscopic measurements and chemometrics.  She and her group at   Virginia
              Commonwealth University will use solvent sensitive dye probes to   investigate
              the solvation of bonded alkyl silica phases used in reverse   phase liquid
              chromatography.  Other studies will involve solvation of   probe molecules in
              non-ideal binary solvent mixtures and characterization   of the solvation of
              alkyl phases based on variations in light   transmittance caused by changes in
              refractive index.  Linear and   non-linear chemometric treatments of the data
              will be performed to   develop models which can be used to predict retention
              behavior.  The process of removing one solute from among others dissolved in a 
               liquid phase involves transfering that solute into another phase.  This   is
              the process of chemical separations and is important from a practical  
              viewpoint for pollution control, production of pure pharmaceuticals and   other
              chemicals, and many other applications.  This work involves a   fundamental
              study of the solvation process to enable a better   understanding of the
              chemistry involved. This could lead to significant   improvements in these
              practical applications.
