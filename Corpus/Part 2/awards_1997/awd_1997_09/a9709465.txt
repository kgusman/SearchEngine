Abstract    :
              When parents save money for their children's college education, a portion of
              their savings is later taken away in the form of reduced eligibility for
              college financial aid.  In this way, the college financial aid system levies a
              sizable implicit tax on assets.  Previous  studies  all find that this implicit
              tax substantially reduces savings.  This project will build on the authors'
              previous work to produce better estimates of the savings impact of college
              financial aid.  The first part of the project will use their tax rate estimates
              together with the methodology developed by Feldstein to estimate directly the
              extent to which the implicit taxes affect asset accumulation for the families
              in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study 1986-1987 (NPSAS 1986-1987). 
              This methodology will not, however, provide an estimate of the steady-state
              impact on asset holdings nor the effect of alternative financial aid systems. 
              These limitations, together with others, argue for adoption of an alternative
              methodology.  The second part of the project will, therefore, estimate family
              preferences and use these estimates to simulate household responses to the
              financial aid system.  This part will begin by fitting data from the NPSAS
              1986-1987 to a standard dynamic model of intertemporal savings and consumption
              decisions, adapted to incorporate choices regarding college expenditure.  This
              procedure will yield estimates of structural parameters corresponding to each
              family's propensity to save and to spend on college.  These parameters will
              then be used to simulate how each family would adjust its savings and
              consumption profiles as well as its college choices under several alternative
              financial aid systems.  Estimates of the long-run impact of each system on
              savings will be made by following each family through the life cycle and
              aggregating assets first across families and second across cohorts.  Finally,
              equivalent variations will be calculated for each family to assess the
              distribution consequences and the efficiency gains or losses from replacing the
              current financial aid system with alternative systems.
