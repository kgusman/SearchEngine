Abstract    :
              9706707  Grassi    This project is concerned with Calabi-Yau manifolds and their
              relation to physics.  On the physics side, there are seven types of string
              theories, which are all consistent.  Five of these theories are classical and
              two are new.  The principal investigator will approach Calabi-Yau manifolds
              from different perspectives and analyze them by "patches".  In particular, she
              will focus on dualities involving the two new string theories.    This is
              research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the
              oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
              flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated figures that
              could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. 
              Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from
              analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as
              well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
