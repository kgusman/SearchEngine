Abstract    :
              Gardner  9706792       The propagation of electrons in quantum semiconductor 
              devices (e.g. resonant tunneling diodes, superlattices, and HEMT  and MODFET
              transistors) can be modeled as the flow of a  continuous charged quantum gas in
              a potential that has  discontinuous jumps at heterojunction barriers.  Quantum
              fluid  dynamical equations can be derived by assuming the gas is near  thermal
              equilibrium, but are expected to be more generally valid.  The investigator and
              his colleague focus on theoretical  modeling, simulation, and analysis of the
              flow of electrons in  one and two spatial dimensions in quantum semiconductor
              devices  based on the ``smooth'' quantum hydrodynamic model and quantum 
              kinetic equations (including the Bloch equation and the  Wigner-Boltzmann
              equation).  The development of modern upwind  numerical methods for simulating
              these equations on high  performance computers is emphasized.      
              Semiconductor devices --- like resonant tunneling diodes and  transistors ---
              that rely on quantum tunneling are playing an  increasingly important role in
              advanced microelectronic  applications, including multiple-state logic and
              memory devices  and high frequency oscillators.  The investigators model the 
              behavior of quantum semiconductor devices by treating electron  flow by means
              of quantum hydrodynamic and quantum kinetic  equations.  The models and
              numerical methods are implemented in a  high-performance industrial computer
              program that can be used by  the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  In this
              way,  semiconductor design engineers can efficiently explore the  behavior of
              various device materials and structures on the  computer before actually
              fabricating the semiconductor device.
