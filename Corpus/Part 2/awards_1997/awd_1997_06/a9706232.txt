Abstract    :
              9706232  Saunders    The proposed research will focus on three major themes
              concerning Paleozoic-Triassic ammonaid cephalopods:  1. Analysis of variation
              in suture-inclusive, whole-shell morphology and morhphologic diversity through
              space and time (Devonian-Triassic), using principal components analysis (PCA)
              of a 21-character set for each taxon;  2. The evolution of ammonoid suture
              complexity through time, as a single-character measure of biological
              complexity, and with respect to evolution of suture complexity in different
              ammonoid clades; and   3. The effects of extinction events on ammonoid
              morphospace, and on morphologic and taxonomic diversity, focusing on three
              major crises: the U. Devonian Frasnian/Famennian, the Devonian/Carboniferous,
              and the Permian/Triassic.    The scope is unprecedented in ammonoid
              investigations, in terms of (a) its time span (~190 my); (b) the comprehensive
              treatment of all 627 Paleozoic ammonoid genera (212 Devonian, 263
              Carboniferous, 152 Permian) plus an additional subset of 25-30 genera (75-100
              species) of basal Triassic ammonoids.  Additionally, in order to precisely
              evaluate the timing of major extinction's and to assess susceptibility,
              persistence, and recurrence of shell morphotypes to these events, we will
              undertake PC analysis of variation in a combined total of 700-750 species (~150
              genera) present during the ca. 0.5-5 my intervals spanning each of the three
              extinction episodes.      This research will be the most complete morphometric
              treatment of Paleozoic and early Mesozoic cephalopods ever undertaken.  It will
              generate a 21+ character morphometric data-set for more than 600 ammonoid
              genera and an additional 700+ species that is taxonomically up-to-date,
              complete and stratigraphically precise.  The time-stepped analysis by PCA will
              permit documentation of how clades evolved, changed in morphologic diversity
              and richness, and how they responded to biotic crises.  The results will have
              bearing on the interpretation of macro-evolutionary change, the evo lution of
              complexity, the influence of morphologic constraints and extinction events on
              variation and diversity, all on a time scale of nearly 200 million years.
