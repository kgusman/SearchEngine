Abstract    :
               9706203  Perry    This is a proposal to study the complex but largely
              unconfined carbonate karst aquifer system of the northern Yucatan Peninsula,
              Mexico.  Over much of its extent this aquifer system is extremely permeable
              with the result that a saline intrusion penetrates at least 100 km inland.  The
              resulting dispersion zone produces important rock-water interaction and affects
              water quality in the overlying fresh water lens.    A principal activity under
              this grant will be measure water levels (with respect to mean sea level) and
              seasonal water level changes throughout the northwest Yucatan Peninsula.  These
              measurements are difficult because of the high permeability and extremely low
              water table gradients on the peninsula.  At the time, they are necessary inputs
              to any meaningful aquifer models. Approximately six water level gages will be
              installed for long-term water level measurements.  Water samples will be taken
              for radium, barium, and stable isotope analysis.  Radium and barium analyses
              will lead to a better understanding of groundwater discharge into the Gulf of
              Mexico, and stable isotope measurements will help determine evapotranspiration.
              The ultimate objective of this work is to compile the information necessary for
              a complete water budget for the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
