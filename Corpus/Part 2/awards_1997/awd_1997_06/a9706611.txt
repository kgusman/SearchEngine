Abstract    :
              Iwaniec    ABSTRACT      Iwaniec will pursue questions about quasiregular
              mappings which   arise as generalizations of geometric aspects of  analytic
              functions   of one complex variable. The mappings in question solve  important
              first order systems of PDEs analogous in many respects to  the Cauchy-Riemann
              equations. The solutions of these systems can be  viewed as "absolute"
              minimizers of certain energy functionals. It is  striking how tight the
              connection is between quasiregular mappings and  the recent development of the
              nonlinear elasticity theory whose  mathematical principles were already
              formulated by S.S. Antman   and J. Ball in 1976-77. Roughly speaking, the
              theory of elasticity   studies mappings, referred to as deformations of elastic
              bodies,   which minimize the so-called stored energy functionals. These  
              functionals are not always convex and the deformations need not be  
              quasiconformal but the governing PDEs are much the same. The   Jacobian
              determinant, in particular, has been subjected to a great   deal of
              investigation.  Ths project accounts for this study   together with some
              generalizations concerning wedge products of   closed differential forms.   
              Quasiconformal mappings generalize to higher dimensions the concept  of
              analytic functions that is so fruitful for science and engineering  in two
              space dimensions. Trying to extend this theory to three or  more space
              dimensions proved quite difficult and the mathematics of  such extension is
              being developed now. Iwaniec will work on how  to extend familiar concepts in
              the plane, like degree, to similar  concepts in space. The theory of non linear
              elasticity, among others,  will benefit from this developments.
