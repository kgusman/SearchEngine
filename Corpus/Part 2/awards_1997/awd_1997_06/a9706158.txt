Abstract    :
              9706158  Gomez    This award is to conduct an SBIR/SI'TR Conference.  The
              National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small
              Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are jointly funding this
              conference with the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
              (EPSCOR).  The conference will involve SBIR/STTR program managers from several
              Federal agencies, the program management from NSF/EPSCOR and University of
              Puerto Rico EPSCOR program, the Puerto Rican Governor's Office and Economic
              Development Department, the U.S. Small Business Administration, national
              laboratories, the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association (Fomento), and large
              Fortune 500 companies.    The conference helps to ensure that the individual
              researchers and research administrators from Puerto Rican colleges and
              universities are informed about opportunities in the SBIR, STTR and EPSCOR
              programs.  The conference also helps to inform small firms in Puerto Rico about
              grant opportunities in NSF's SBIR and STTR programs as well as funding
              opportunities in several Federal agencies.  An expected outcome is a better
              coordinated high technology small business effort in Puerto involving the state
              government, the Federal government, the universities anti small businesses. 
              The conference will facilitate better communication between researchers,
              enhance joint research, promote collaborative research and leveraging of
              research efforts, and develop networks for technical interactions.  The
              conference forms the basis for continuing efforts to increase participation by
              small and disadvantaged and minority and female-owned firms in the SBIR and
              STTR programs.
