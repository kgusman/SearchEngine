Abstract    :
               9706178  Schieber    Pyrite ooids are sedimentary grains of up to 4mm diameter
              that show concentric pyrite laminae around a core of variable composition. 
              First mention of such grains was made by Hayes (1915), and since then they have
              sporadically been mentioned in the literature (e.g. Kalliokoski, 1966; Gorter,
              1991; Taylor, 1949; Kearsley, 1989).  In all these references, pyrite ooids are
              found in association with oolitic ironstones, are summarily described in a few
              sentences, and interpreted as diagenetic alterations of chamositic or goethitic
              ooids.  Hayes (1915) and Carozzi (1972) are the lone exceptions in considering
              pyrite ooids as of primary origin.   My interest in pyrite ooids stems from my
              first encounter with these enigmatic grains in the Chattanooga Shale of
              Tennessee.  In a sedimentary sequence that was supposedly deposited under
              anoxic conditions in comparatively deep water (Potter et al., 1982; Ettensohn
              et al., 1988; Woodrow et al., 1988; Leventhal et al., 1987), these grains, with
              their implication of agitation and wave reworking, seemed to be oddly out of
              place.   Since then I have become aware of other occurrences of pyrite ooids,
              and was able to acquire material from two of them.  Samples and polished thin
              sections from the Chattanooga Shale, the Decorah Shale (Cambrian of Iowa), and
              the Powers Steps Formation (Wabana iron ores, Ordovician of Newfoundland) were
              examined with petrographic and electron microscopes (reflected/transmitted
              light; SEM and BEI mode; EDAX).  This preliminary study showed features that
              suggest that pyrite ooids may indeed be primary intrabasinal grains, and also
              indicates that there are several types of pyrite ooids that may well be
              reflective of paleoceanographic conditions at the time of deposition.   Funds
              are requested for a detailed comparative study of pyrite ooids from a variety
              of depositional settings and time periods.  The aim of the study is (1) to
              verify that primary pyrite ooids do indeed exist, (2) to show that primary
              pyrite ooids ar e a more widespread phenomenon than typically appreciated, (3)
              to determine the conditions for their formation, (4) to understand the various
              pathways for pyrite ooid formation, and (5) to derive information about
              paleoceanographic parameters, such as presence or absence of anoxia, energy
              level of the environment, water depth, chemical conditions at the seafloor and
              in the surface sediment, and rate of deposition.
