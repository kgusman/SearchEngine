Abstract    :
              97-06559  Chapman    Temperature-depth profiles, measured in boreholes, contain
              a temporal record of past changes in ground surface temperature (GST) and
              provide valuable constraints on climatic variations over the last few
              centuries, a critical time period that extends past the historical
              meteorological   record.  Ultimate resolution of the recovered GST depends on
              the resolution of the subsurface temperature profile and the confidence with
              which one can partition curvature in the temperature profile between transient
              causes (i.e. changes in  surface temperature with time) and steady-state causes
              (i.e. topography, terrain and vegetation, heat production and thermal
              conductivity heterogeneities, groundwater movement, etc.).  Because precision
              monitoring and repeat logging of temperatures in wells will reduce the
              interpretation ambiguity by isolating the transient component of the
              temperature field, a program of studying borehole thermal regimes and   their
              changes with time is proposed.  This project entails 1) operation of a
              real-time surface observatory (weather station installed at a borehole site) to
              monitor meteorological variables and near-surface temperature, 2) repeat
              logging of boreholes to improve the resolution of the steady-state temperature
              field, 3) data analysis to calculate the in-situ thermal and physical
              properties of the boundary, and 4) determining the temporal and spatial
              resolution of GSTs.  The final product and significance of this project is an
              understanding of ground temperature as a record of climatic  change and a
              calibration for existing and ongoing regional borehole studies.    ***
