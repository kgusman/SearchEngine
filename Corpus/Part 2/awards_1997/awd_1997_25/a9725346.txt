Abstract    :
              9725346  Rumble  This proposed U.S.-Japan-Russia-Kazakhstan cooperative project
              will continue field, petrologic, stable, isotopic, geochronologic, and tectonic
              investigations of intracratonal ultrahigh-pressure and high-pressure
              metamorphic rocks in the Kokchetav Massif and the Maksyutov Complex, where
              coesite ( microdiamonds have been described. Primary objectives are to: (1)
              determine the regional distribution and structural relationships among
              diamond-bearing gneiss and marble, coesite-bearing eclogite and gneiss, and
              other UHP and HP rocks in the Kokchetav Massif and the Maksyutov Complex; (2)
              identify and characterize the mineral inclusions in garnet and zircon from
              eclogite, gneiss, marble, and schist to establish conditions of UHP
              metamorphism and the effect of such elevated pressures; (3) delineate mineral
              parageneses and P-T-t paths for eclogite, whiteschist, garnet peridotite,
              blueschist, gneiss and marble; (4) characterize 18O/16O ratios of silicates and
              carbon isotopes of diamond, magnesite, and other carbonates in order to
              evaluate the role of fluids at mantle depths; (5) determine the structural and
              geochemical characteristics of protoliths in order to infer their plate
              tectonic settings; (6) establish the ages of blueschist, eclogite, and
              retrograde metamorphism through U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar dating; and (7) compare
              findings from central Asia with those from eastern China in order to elucidate
              the genetic relationships among recognized metamorphic, igneous, and tectonic
              features.
