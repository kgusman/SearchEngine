Abstract    :
              ***  9725478  McPhee     This study is concerned with the analysis of an
              extensive data set obtained by the principal investigator in the context of two
              interdisciplinary field projects in the Weddell Sea:  the Joint U.S.-Russian
              Ice Camp in 1992 and Anzflux in 1994.  The data set consists of direct
              measurements of  Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat fluxes in the uppermost
              100 meters of the ocean under a continuous sea ice cover, and was the first
              such observations made in the Southern Ocean.  The objective of the analysis is
              continued development of a turbulence closure technique in the numerical
              modelling of the upper ocean, and to describe the structure of boundary layer
              turbulence under exceptionally wide ranges of surface stress and buoyancy flux.
                A frequent criticism of current upper ocean models is that their
              representations of turbulent exchange processes are arbitrarily adjusted to
              reproduce the few available observed time series of upper ocean structure. 
              This work will provide the basis for a significantly improved modelling of
              upper ocean turbulence by requiring the model algorithms to reproduce a wide
              range of turbulence intensities, and will include a novel approach to
              specifying the eddy properties of the upper ocean.   These analyses, in
              conjunction with concurrent analyses of other experiments carried out in the
              two field projects, will produce a framework for quantifying the energy brought
              to the underside of the ice, and will form the basis of a regional study of the
              processes responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice
              cover.  It is believed that the sea ice cover is only marginally stable in the
              face of the high upward heat flux, and if this were interrupted, could lead to
              deep vertical convection and a significant change in the ocean climate.  ***
