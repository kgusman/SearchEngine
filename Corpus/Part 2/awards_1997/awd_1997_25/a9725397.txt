Abstract    :
              9725397  Frank    The Mesoproterozoic Eon (1600-1000 Ma) represents a critical
              period in Earth history from the standpoint of eukaryotic diversification
              (Knoll, 1991), fundamental transitions in the oxidation state of the Earth's
              atmosphere and oceans (Des Marais et al., 1992; Canfield and Teske, 1996), and
              global tectonic reorganization (Dalziel, 1991).  Yet despite this obvious
              significance, the Mesoproterozoic remains one of the most poorly understood and
              poorly documented intervals in Earth history.  For example, in reference to an
              apparent stability in the Mesoproterozoic marine carbon isotopic record, the
              era between 1600 Ma and 1000 Ma has been reported as 'the dullest time in
              Earth's history' (Buick et al., 1995).  However, a large positive shift (3-4%)
              in marine carbonate (13C values has recently been recognized in late
              Mesoproterozoic (<1300 Ma) successions from Siberia, Arctic Canada, Greenland,
              and the United States.  Rather than a short-lived excursion, this shift appears
              to represent a prolonged and fundamental change that may represent a
              significant transition in the Earth's global carbon cycle.  The timing of this
              observed transition, between ~1300 and ~1150 Ma, is particularly intriguing in
              that it occurs in conjunction with the early assembly of the Rodinian
              supercontinent and a purported rise in the concentration of atmospheric oxygen.
                 The goal of the proposed research is to generate carbon, sulfur and
              strontium isotopic data for this interval and, thereby, document and begin to
              address mechanistically the most fundamental (first-order) shifts in the
              chemistry of the Mesoproterozoic ocean.  These objectives will be achieved
              through a multidisciplinary study that integrates depositional, diagenetic, and
              geochemical information into a single comprehensive framework.  Although no
              single stratigraphic succession adequately encompasses the interval surrounding
              the observed carbon isotopic shift, two distinct successions (Society Cliffs
              Formation, northern Baffin Island; Dismal L akes Group, Coppermine homocline,
              Northwest Territories) can be effectively spliced to provide coverage across
              the interval of the observed transition.  Each of these successions has been
              chosen on the basis of accessibility and exposure of stratigraphic units, the
              presence of a wide variety of facies and lithologies suitable for geochemical
              analysis, and the abundance of a variety of allochems and marine cements from
              different depositional environments.  Combined, these prerequisites assure
              recognition of depositional and diagenetic trends that would otherwise hamper
              the interpretation of geochemical and isotopic data.  Such an integrated
              approach will provide the clearest path toward understanding the complex
              evolution of the Proterozoic biosphere.
