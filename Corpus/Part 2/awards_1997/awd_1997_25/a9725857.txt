Abstract    :
              9725857  Vergeront    The Minnesota Children's Museum, in collaboration with the
              American Library Association will develop a project to engage children ages two
              through seven years old and their parents in exploring mathematics through
              hands-on, book-based math activities in libraries and children's museums across
              the country. The main elements of the project are:    1. A 1200 square foot
              exhibit at the Minnesota Children's Museum;   2. A traveling exhibit to ten
              children's museums over a six month period;  3. Five smaller versions of the
              exhibit will travel to 75 libraries sponsored by the American Library
              Association. Each library that apply for the exhibit must present a plan in
              which 50 percent of their exhibit audience will be children and families of the
              under-represented, lower income groups, and racial and/or ethnic groups.   4.
              Programs and materials will be designed to provide parents with the means to
              actively participate in their children's math education.    The collaboration
              of the Minnesota Children's Museum and the American Library Association draws
              together two organizations whose natural constituencies are parents with young
              children. Project 1,2,3 is designed to be national in scope and creates
              multiple formats within which families can enjoy exploring math. Its goals and
              objectives reflect four messages: start early, math is everywhere, parental
              involvement and get into books.    The project Principal Investigator (PI) Ms.
              Jeanne W. Vergeront received her Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Science in
              Child and Family Studies and Environmental Design, respectively from the
              University of Wisconsin, Madison. Currently, she serves as the Vice President,
              Educational Projects at the Minnesota Children's Museum in St. Paul, Minnesota.
