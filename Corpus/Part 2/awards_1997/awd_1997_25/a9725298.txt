Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the  National Science
              Foundation, supports research to continue  isotopic and trace element studies
              of the Dufek layered  mafic intrusion in the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica.
              This  research utilizes 338 samples that were collected on field  expeditions
              in 1993 and 1995. The Dufek intrusion is one of  the largest bodies of its kind
              in the world, and  mineralogical relationships preserved in it offer insights 
              crystallization and chemical differentiation processes in  large volumes of
              relatively homogeneous magmas.  New work to  be done under this project will
              focus on measuring elemental  concentrations and isotopic ratios of Nd, Sr, and
              Pb within  individual mineral grains from two stratigraphic intervals  in the
              intrusion (the Frost Pyroxenite to Spear Anorthosite  section and the Lower
              Inclusion Member to Upper Inclusion  Member section).  These analyses will be
              used to model  chemical differentiation of key minerals during the 
              crystallization process and to identify possible chemical  signatures of magma
              chamber recharge event or magma  contamination by melting of the surrounding
              wall rocks which  are known to occur in large mafic magma bodies.  Both 
              sequences of rock contain abrupt changes in mineralogy and  chemical
              composition.  These chemical and mineralogical  studies will allow comparison
              of the Dufek to the intrusive  sills of the Ferrar Group from other parts of
              the  Transantarctic Mountains.  Inasmuch as data from the first  phase of study
              suggested that assimilation and fractional  crystallization were important
              processes in the Dufek magma  chamber, the new data acquired under this project
              will also  be modeled using differential equations that calculate the  mass
              rate of assimilation of surrounding rock relative to  crystallization within
              the intrusion.
