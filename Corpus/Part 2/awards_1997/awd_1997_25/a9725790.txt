              PROJECT: Windows on the Wild - Exploring Biodiversity    The World Wildlife
              Fund will develop Windows on the Wild - Exploring Biodiversity.  The components
              of this project include two editions of a 2000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit,
              mini-exhibition kits designed to reach small and medium-sized institutions, and
              complementary educational materials designed to reach the general public and
              families including traditionally underserved audiences, students, and
              educators.  With this project WWF intends to raise awareness and interest in
              biodiversity - its importance and its decline; raise awareness of the nature
              and role of scientific research in investigating and protecting biodiversity;
              raise awareness of, interest in, and understanding of the impacts of personal
              choices on biodiversity; and motivate and empower individuals to get involved
              in biodiversity issues.  The exhibits will include a centerpiece theater
              introduction surrounded by five sections presenting activities and information
              related to the themes: What is Biodiversity? How Do We Find Out? Why is it
              Important? Why Is It at Risk? and How Can We Get Involved?  Ancillary materials
              form the general public will include A Family Biodiversity Discovery Notebook,
              a take-home booklet, a brochure format for host institutions to use
              highlighting local events, among others.  Complementary materials linking the
              exhibit to formal education activities include Educator's Info, and Windows on
              the Wild Biodiversity Educational Materials, as well as information about
              workshop and institutes.
