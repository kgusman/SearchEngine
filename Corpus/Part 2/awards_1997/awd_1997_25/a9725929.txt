Abstract    :
              9725929  Torikachvili    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research
              collaboration  between Drs. Milton Torikachvili and Alex Lacerda of San  Diego
              State University to work with Drs. Renato de  Figueiredo Jardim and Sergio Gama
              at the University of Sao  Paulo and the University of Campinas, respectively,
              on  electronic and magnetic properties of novel materials.    Specifically,
              they will study transport, magnetic, and  thermodynamic properties of strongly
              correlated electron  systems (SCES), and transition metal oxides displaying
              large  magnetoresistive effects.  The studies  will be done in low  magnetic
              fields, as well as in extreme conditions of high  magnetic fields and low
              temperatures on high quality  specimens, with the goal of advancing the
              understanding of  these materials and to test current models.    This
              collaboration will combine the resources, facilities  and expertise of San
              Diego State University, the National  High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Los
              Alamos, the University  of Sao Paulo and the University of Campinas.  The two 
              Brazilian universities support one of the largest efforts in  condensed matter
              research in Latin America.  At Los Alamos,  the PIs will be given access to the
              60 tesla quasicontinuous  magnet, which is the world's strongest controlled
              power  magnet and the first one of its kind in the US.  The US PIs  bring their
              extensive experience in performing measurements  of electronic and magnetic
              properties at extreme conditions.  Professor Gama is experienced in the study
              of phase  relations in magnetic materials.  Dr. Jardim will be  training new
              students throughout this project.    ***
