Abstract    :
              The Scientific Knowledge for Indian Learning and Leadership   (SKILL) Program at
              Oglala Lakota College was established in 1989.   This precollege program
              addresses academic support and career  guidance for a large number of students
              at the elementary, middle  and high school levels.  The program indicates an
              excellent record  of influencing transition into post-secondary institutions. 
              The  high school graduation rate among participants is 100 percent. 
              Complementing this record is an ACT performance average which  exceeds the
              national average.  SKILL's participants have also  received several local and
              national awards.  There is evidence that  the SKILL's model for academic
              reinforcement and support has  attracted the attention of other academic
              institutions.    SKILL has reached a relatively large number of American Indian
                students (3,000), fostering their interest in math and science.   The program
              shows good success in student retention and transition  to college from high
              school.  Twenty of the 24 original first year  students graduated from the
              SKILL program in 1996 and all applied  for admission to a university and
              identified a major in science or  engineering.  The strengths of the nominee
              include:      .  Continuity of focus on Native Americans is clear and very     
                   distinctive.    .  Early and sustained intervention.    .  Demonstrated
              staff dedication and leadership.    .  Holistic approach to supplemental
              learning that covers             elementary through high school students.    . 
              Large number of experiments flown on space shuttle missions.    .  Promotion of
              dual course enrollment.    .  Summer residential activity for eligible high
              school students.         In summary, this is a holistic approach to
              supplemental learning.   The program intervenes at key grade levels at which
              precollege  students encounter difficulty in science and mathematics.  This 
              latter activity has the potential of influencing systemic change.
