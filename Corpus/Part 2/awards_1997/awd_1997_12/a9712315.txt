Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    OPP-9712315  MORISON, JAMES  UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON      The
              investigators will conduct a workshop on the future research needs required to
              monitor a change in oceanic circulation observed on the 1994 Arctic Ocean
              Section joint US and Canadian traverse of the Arctic Ocean.  The participants
              will design a long-term research program that will provide information about
              the extent of warm water spreading into the Arctic Ocean that had not been
              observed prior to 1994.  The continued monitoring of the new circulation
              pattern will allow assessment of the causes for the shift to an
              Atlantic-dominated pattern from a Pacific-dominated circulation pattern. At
              present it is impossible to determine if the observed change is cyclic or a
              permanent change in response to global warming.  The research program designed
              as a result of the workshop will provide the long-term dataset necessary to
              assess the possible global change impact on the Arctic Ocean.  If shown to have
              a global change driving force, the impacts of the new circulation pattern will
              have major implications for global circulation and the permanence of the Arctic
              Ocean ice pack.
