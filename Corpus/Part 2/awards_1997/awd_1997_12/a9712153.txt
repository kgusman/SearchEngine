               Modeling heat and mass transport in the  TAG  active  hydrothermal       mound
                    using       a        combined  theoretical/observational approach     
              Ridge-crest hydrothermal systems play a fundamental role  in  transferring 
              energy  and  mass  fluxes  from  the   Earth's  interior to its surface. In the
              fall of 1994, 17 holes  were  drilled  in  the 200 meter diameter TAG active 
              hydrothermal  mound  on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during Leg 158 of the Ocean 
              Drilling  Program to investigate the fluid flow, geochemical  fluxes,  and the
              subsurface nature of an active hydrothermal  mound.   This  mound is perhaps
              the closest mid-ocean  ridge  analog  to Cyprus ore bodies and has an estimated
              convective  heat  flux  from the black smokers of 225 MW, and  from  the 
              entire  mound area of 500-1000 MW.  Theoretical calculations  will  be carried
              out to examine the relationships among  the  different fluids exiting the
              mound, and to examine the  role  of  seawater  entrainment at TAG, including 
              the  amount  of  seawater entrained, and what imprint such entrainment leaves 
              in   the   deposits,  and  in  fluids  exiting  the   mound.  Calculations  of
              transport and reaction will also  be  done,  allowing establishment of links
              between fluid chemistry  and  observed  mineralogy and texture of drillcore
              samples.   The  emphasis will be on modeling processes occurring during  the 
              most recent phase of hydrothermal activity, i.e., related to  (i)  formation 
              of anhydrite (CaSO4) veins, (ii)  alteration  and mineralization associated
              with veining, (iii) deposition  of  chimneys  and sulfide crusts at the mound 
              surface,  and  (iv) formation of fluids currently exiting the mound.  These 
              studies  will  allow  quantification  of  mass  fluxes   and  examination  of 
              processes involved in  mineral  deposition,  zoning,  and  zone  refinement in
              one of the  largest  known  active hydrothermal mounds along the mid-ocean
              ridge sys tem.
