Abstract    :
              This  project investigates the efficiency of capital markets in the transition
              economies of Central Europe.  Well functioning capital markets are of great
              potential importance to this region.  Public trust that these markets are fair
              and not rigged in favor of insiders is important both in generating the capital
              needed for economic restructuring and in building support for market mechanisms
              and the sometimes painful steps involved in the transition.  This research
              focuses on both the extent of efficiency in these developing markets and on how
              different choices with respect to privatization may have affected the working
              of the eventual capital market.  In addition, it analyzes the workings of the
              artificial and self-contained capital market created by the Czech voucher
              privatization scheme.  A series of studies will be undertaken  which apply
              market techniques to emerging Central European capital markets.  These
              techniques are similar to the ones used in the study of other markets including
              the emerging markets in Latin America and Asia.  These studies will allow for a
              comparison of market structure and efficiency in markets that emerged rapidly
              following radical changes in economic structure with those that emerged more
              gradually or have had a long history of development.  Insights will be obtained
              into the ability of various methods of privatization to promote or hinder
              well-functioning capital markets.
