              Vanderbilt University                     This grant is awarded through the
              Separations and Purification Program        sub-element of the Interfacial,
              Transport and Separations Program of        the Chemical and Transport Systems
              Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. Robert Tanner from
              Vanderbilt University. The         research involves development of a technique
              for protein separations        using foam and bubble fractionation. While it is
              well known that        bubbling a gas through aqueous protein-containing
              solutions leads to        protein adsorption on the bubble interface and
              transport with the        bubble to the solution surface, exploitation of the
              phenomenon to        extract proteins from solution has been prevented due
              several inherent        problems. Most important amongst them is the possible
              denaturation of        the protein either as a result of protein unfolding at
              the gas-water        interface or as a result of shear-induced denaturation as
              a        consequence of bubble burst. The process is difficult to study and the
                     parameters that govern the extraction of proteins with maximal       
              retention of structure/function have not yet been elucidated. The       
              research seeks to conduct a systematic  study of the phenomenon and       
              determine the variables that affect protein extraction, selectivity        and
              retention of structure/function.               The research would contribute to
              the fundamental understanding of        proteins at liquid-gas interfaces. 
              From a technological perspective,        the studies could lead to defining
              operating conditions that result in        protein extraction with retention of
              structure/function. The method        proposed is very inexpensive and could
              have significant applications        in  the extraction and recovery of
              industrial enzymes.
