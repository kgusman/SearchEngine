Abstract    :
              9712857  Warwick    Mining of the Comstock Lode (1860-1890) resulted in the
              release of an estimated 7,500 tons of mercury to the Carson River system
              including Lahontan  Reservoir.  Much of the polluted sediment is associated
              with filled paleochannels which are thought to have been produced by the
              filling of abandoned meanders previously cutoff from the main channel.  Given
              that a majority of the present day mercury load in the Carson River is derived
              from bank erosion, it follows that during floods, much of the eroded sediment
              is returned to storage by the deposition of sediment within the channels of the
              abandoned meanders.   Thus, there may be a cycling of contaminated debris
              between the channel and the valley fill during flood events which inundated the
              valley floor.  In early January, 1997 flood flows, with a magnitude which has
              only been exceeded once in the past 57 years of record, inundated large regions
              of the Carson River valley.  Field observations made during and following the
              event revealed that numerous  reaches along the channel suffered extensive
              erosion, while thick sedimentary sequences were deposited over other regions of
              the valley floor.  Based on these field observations, we believe that this  low
              frequency, high magnitude event had a significant affect on the transport and
              storage of mercury contaminated particles along the Carson River valley.  The
              primary objectives of this investigation are to (1) document the patterns of
              erosion and deposition that occurred along the Carson River valley from Carson
              City to Lahontan Reservoir during the January, 1997 flood, (2)determine the
              spatial variations in mercury concentration that occur within the newly formed
              flood deposits, and (3) assess the primary controls on both the deposition of
              contaminated sediments and the distribution of mercury within those deposits. 
              By combining the conclusions reached in this investigation with previous
              studies of the Carson River, we will be able to assess the transport and fate
              of mercury by phy sical processes over time periods ranging from individual
              flood events to decades.  In addition, a comparison of the geographic trends
              measured prior to and following the storm will lead to significant insights
              into the importance of rare, high magnitude floods on the dispersal of heavy
              metals in alluvial deposits.
