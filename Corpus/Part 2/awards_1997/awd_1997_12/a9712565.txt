Abstract    :
              9712565  Valavanis  The theme and central objective of the Workshop is 
              Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for Shallow Water and Coastal  Environments. 
              Specific applications will target shallow  water environments related to
              wetlands and shallow water  fisheries monitoring, coastal studies, monitoring
              of  environmental pollution due to industrial wastes, offshore  oilfield
              platform and pipeline inspection and maintenance.  An oil spill in wetlands is
              quite different from an ocean or  beach oil spill.  The swamps around river
              banks and bayous  are not easily accessible to any containment and remediation 
              process.  Further, the sinking oil in water, among weeds,  and in sediment
              materials make it more difficult to detect,  identify and confine.  In addition
              to the already mentioned  difficulties, it is not advisable to use humans for
              such  functions due to the hazardous nature of the tasks.  Thus, a  relatively
              inexpensive AUV equipped with the proper sensors  and controls may provide a
              viable alternative solution to  the problem.    The anticipated outcome of the
              meeting will be:              a clear understanding of the problem area
              (shallow         water environments),       derivation of operational and
              mission constraints, and       requirements and a suggested AUV architecture to
              build  such a vehicle.    Proceedings will be produced and distributed.  ***
