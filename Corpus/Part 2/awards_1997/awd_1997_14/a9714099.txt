                                           Proposal to the National Science Foundation for    
                 SGER Funds to Conduct an Evaluation of Nelday Impact on School

                     San Francisco, CA            Netday is a widespread grassroots
              initiative to help schools connect to the      national information
              infrastructure. It is a high-tech barn raising where      volunteers in
              partnership with businesses and other organizations install high-      speed
              data wire in K-12 classrooms. It is a national, yet distributed effort, begun
              in      California about one year ago. Unsubstantiated estimates from the
              Netday      organizers suggest that more than 250,000 volunteers installed
              cable in more than      twenty percent of the nation's classrooms in the
              California and national Netdays.            Netday represents an important
              opportunity to bring Internet connectivity to all      students but there are
              serious policy implications that speak to the nation's goals      for creating
              a powerful and dynamic telecommunications infrastructure for      education.
              Netday is a strategic and important piece of the puzzle because it      focuses
              on the local infrastructure inside the school. In combination with the     
              possibility of reduced access costs under the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
              it      has the potential for bringing the Internet to the desktops of millions
              of students      to use for science and math applications.            Netday is
              defined as a project to install data wire in classrooms; wiring a school     
              site for a network is a necessary condition to get all students connected to
              the      Internet. Netday has resulted in many wired classrooms, however, we
              know      little about the schools' efforts to finish the task of connecting
              the schools to the      information infrastructure and preparing teachers to
              use it effectively.            In  spite of the significance of this phenomenon
              for changing the nature of      schooling, almost no reliable data about Netday
              exists. We need to know:              if this is primarily an event for the
              well-off suburbs that has the consequence of      increasing the gap between
              the information haves and have-nots;              if the model of pulling wires
              to five classrooms and not addressing the Internet      service to the building
              or the instructional applications of the Internet limits the      impact of the
              volunteer program;              the funding sources for the other parts of the
              puzzle and whether these are      differentially distributed according to
              wealth of the local community;              the immediate and long term roles
              of volunteers from the community and      from businesses in helping schools
              developed their infrastructure and change      teaching and learning.
