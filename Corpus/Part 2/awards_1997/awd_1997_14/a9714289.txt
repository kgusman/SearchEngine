Abstract    :
               9714289 Li  This CAA project addresses selective area chemical vapor deposition
              of GaN and InGaN. The PI is a chemist planning to develop and expand her
              scientific expertise in the field of epitaxy of III-nitride semiconductor
              research, which will allow her to bring interdisciplinary approaches and
              insights to the field. She expects to move into active research fabricating low
              dimensional structures such as quantum wells, wires and dots and to study the
              quantum size effect on optical and electrical properties. Her long range goal
              is to develop new and better materials that have novel properties and potential
              applications, to advance the understanding of III-V semiconductor materials
              properties and to contribute to the realization of the full potential of
              III-nitride as well as other III-V semiconductors in device applications. In
              this project the correlation of optical properties with defect and impurity
              distributions will be explored, the selective growth of InGaN films will be
              carried out on single and dual stripe patterns., and the effect of selective
              growth on the doping behavior of Si2H6 and Cp2Mg in GaN will be studied as a
              function of mesa size and geometry. %%% The project addresses materials science
              and engineering research issues in a topical area of materials science having
              high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials
              science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of
              electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuits.  Additionally, the
              fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to
              contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices by providing a
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved
              materials. ***
