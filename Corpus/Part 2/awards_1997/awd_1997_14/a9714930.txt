Abstract    :
              Abstract - Sirignano    This is a theoretical, computational, and experimental
              study examining multidimensional, transonic, multicomponent, reacting flows in
              a high Reynolds-number range, with emphasis on the coupling between combustion
              processes and fluid-dynamic phenomena in an accelerating or decelerating flow. 
              The impacts on efficiency of the energy conversion, on hydrodynamic stability,
              and on the potential formation of oxides of nitrogen are considered.  Energy
              efficiency is examined in situations in which temperature is limited by
              material constraints so that expression of released energy as kinetic energy is
              advantageous.  Hydrodynamic stability is studied in reacting flows where severe
              density stratifications and strong pressure gradients are present.  Effects of
              reduction of flame temperature in the stream, including potentials for
              extinction and reduced nitrogen oxide formation, are analyzed.  This is
              primarily a study of fundamental issues and broad applications, but one
              application will be explored in some detail: combustion in turbine passages in
              ground-based gas turbines.  This study could potentially lead to new concepts
              for design of turbines that are more efficient, more stable, and less polluting
              than extant models.  Broad applications wherever gas turbines are used would be
              foreseen, including electric power generation, aircraft propulsion, and other
              power systems.
