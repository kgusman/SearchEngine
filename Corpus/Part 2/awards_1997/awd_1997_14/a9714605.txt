Abstract    :
              9714605  Seible  Advanced composite materials such as carbon, aramid, or  glass
              fibers in polymer matrices, such as epoxies,  vinylesters and polyesters, have
              shown outstanding  mechanical and chemical characteristics to be of great 
              interest to civil engineering design and construction.    Recent developments
              in manufacturing technologies and the  need for new and more durable materials
              for rehabilitation  of existing civil structural systems and renewal 
              requirements of the aging building and bridge inventory have  shown that the
              light weight of these polymer matrix  composites can be cost-effectively
              employed, particularly in  the seismic retrofitting of buildings and bridges.  
               A concept which emerges from this combination of  conventional civil
              construction materials, and for the civil  engineering sector new polymer
              matrix composites (PMCs),  is  that of concrete filled composite tubes (CCTs),
              where the  concrete takes on the compression force transfer and the  carbon
              shell the functions of (1) formwork for the concrete,  (2) confinement of the
              concrete, and (3) tension force  transfer in both longitudinal bending and
              shear.  The thin  advanced composite tubes and stabilized against local 
              instabilities by the infill  concrete which can be pressure  grouted and
              contain normal or lightweight aggregates.    The research aims to
              systematically develop the basis for a  new framing system made of filament
              wound hybrid  glass/carbon tubes and filled on-site fully or partially  with
              concrete.  The research focus will be in three areas  namely, (1) the
              analytical modeling and characterization of  the fully and partially grouted
              advanced composite tube  system and the proposed connections, (2) development
              of  optimized hybrid schemes and fabrication techniques,  and  (3) the
              experimental full-scale validation of CCT beams and  connections.    The
              analytical models will be calibrated and verified by the  test  results and
              used for subsequent parametric studies to  form the basis for general design 
              model developments for  concrete filled advanced composite tube framing
              systems.  ***
