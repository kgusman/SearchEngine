Abstract    :
              This project completes development of a Rayleigh-Doppler lidar system at the
              Millstone Hill Observatory, and operates in part of an existing instrument
              cluster.  The instrument cluster includes the lidar system, an incoherent
              scatter radar, a Fabry-Perot interferometer, a meteor wind radar, and an
              optical tomographic imaging instrument.  The data improves understanding of
              sources of tidal variability in the altitude of transition between the
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  The lidar instrument uses the MIT Lincoln
              Laboratory Firepond 1.2 meter diameter, fully-steerable telescope, as the
              telescope's steerability allows full vector wind measurements up to 86 km at
              night, with a potential for daytime observations to lower altitudes.  The
              instrument cluster measures density, temperature, and winds with high
              resolution over roughly the entire altitude range from about 30 to 130 km, thus
              greatly extending current observations into the source region and into the
              important tidal propagation path, where the tidal amplitudes are modulated. 
              Simultaneous Doppler wind and temperature data collected for both day and night
              clarifies the role that gravity wave (GW) dissipation has in contributing to
              the variability of tidal structure.  These measurements are also examined for
              the expected correlation between the developing mesosphere temperature
              inversion layer and the forcing of the lower mesosphere zonal wind jet that may
              both be caused by gravity wave dissipation processes.
