In a similar fashion, th  e South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) also operates trader federal and state mandates to provide long-term oppommities for research, education and interpretation with particular emphasis on estuaries within the lower Columbian bi ogeogr  aphic region. These complementary missions focus on increasing fundamental knowledge and public awareness of marine ecosystems through scientific research and teaching directed at understanding interactions of marine organisms and their environment. The S  ou  th Slough NERR has recently acquired $450,000 in funds ($200K NOAA / $250K State of Oregon) to support construction of a dedicated Estuarine and Coastal Research Laboratory on the OIMB campus. Construction and operation of the new research facility will f  urther strengthen the academic relationship between these institutions and will serve as a catalyst to increase utilization of OIMB and the South Slough NERR by visiting researchers. This proposal seeks $60,000 in order to add 500 sq. ft. of laboratory sp  ace to the new Estuarine and Coastal Research Laboratory for use by scientists visiting OIMB.  \par \sect }\sectd \sbknone\linex0 \pard\plain \f4\fs20 {\f5\fs22   \par }}
