Abstract    :
              Stahl   97-14303    Diversity and Habitat Range of Sulfate-Reducing
              Microorganisms    The biogeochemical cycling of elements (e.g., C, N, S, P) is
              the most general characteristic of the biosphere. The persistence of key
              biogeochemical cycles through different environmental extremes is the most
              general question encompassed by this research. More specifically, this study
              will focus on one step in the sulfur cycle, dissimilatory sulfate reduction
              (sulfate respiration), and better define the microbial diversity associated
              with, and the environmental constraints on, this key process. The need for this
              focus was indicated by recent comparative analyses of a highly conserved enzyme
              in the pathway for sulfate respiration, the dissimilatory sulfite reductase
              (DSR), suggesting that sulfate (or sulfite) respiration is an extremely ancient
              metabolism, possibly predating the divergence of the three domains of life. If
              this is so, then the diversity of sulfate-reducing microorganisms is almost
              certainly poorly described. In order to more fully evaluate their diversity and
              activity, environments demonstrating extremes of pH, temperature, and salinity
              will be characterized using a DSR-based analysis in combination with
              complementary microbiological, molecular (165 rRNA), and functional analyses.
              These studies should greatly expand understanding of the evolutionary origins
              of organisms mediating this key step in the sulfur cycle and the roles they
              play in contemporary ecosystems.    This project, which is being supported by
              the Division of Environmental Biology, the Chemistry Division, and the Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
              Directorate.
