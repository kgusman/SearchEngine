Abstract    :
              9714047  Schubert    Research in III-V nitride material system has resulted in
              significant improvements in material quality over the last few years, and has
              resulted in the demonstration of high temperature transistors, efficient light
              emitting diodes, and lasers emitting in the ultraviolet and blue regions of the
              optical spectrum.   However, in order to produce, reliable GaN-based devices,
              several materials challenges must yet be overcome, including increasing the
              p-type dopant concentrations attainable in these structures.    In this work,
              Prof. Schubert and his graduate student propose to overcome this p-doping
              limitation by means of "superlattice doping".  Superlattice doping, the short
              period compositional modulation of uniformly doped semiconductors, promises to
              decrease the effective activation energy of acceptors in GaN, thereby enhancing
              the free hole concentration by approximately one order of magnitude.  Abrupt
              and parabolically graded composition modulation in the AlGaN/GaN material
              system will be investigated and the influence of the grading on in-plane and
              perpendicular hole transport will be studied.  ***
