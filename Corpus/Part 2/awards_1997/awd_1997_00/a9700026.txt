Abstract    :
              This REG award provides funds for the purchase of research  equipment related to
              experiments in control of constrained non  smooth mechanical systems. The
              equipment comprises of a two axis  direct drive motion setup, digital
              oscilloscope, force sensor,  deburring tools, data acquisition cards, power
              supplies and  amplifiers, and computers for simulations and real time control. 
              The research addresses applications of the results from the  theory of
              non-smooth differential equations to the modeling and  control of constrained
              mechanical systems, which are  characterized by nonlinear
              differential-algebraic equations and  often such phenomena as Coulomb
              friction,saturation dead zones  and backlash. The equipment will facilitate
              experiments in  automation of surface finishing operations,utilizing the unique
               methodology developed for such operations, and will identify new  research
              directions in the area of control applications of non  smooth mechanical
              systems. In addition, it will be used as a  testbed for automated deburring,
              grinding, and other edge  finishing operations, the behavior of which can be
              accurately  described by non-smooth mechanical system dynamics. The  knowledge
              base developed from the proposed experiments on the  test-bed will provide
              significant insight towards solving some  of the problems associated with
              complex real-world automated  surface finishing operations in the industry.
              Besides advancing  the fundamental knowledge in control theory and its 
              applications, experiments conducted on the proposed equipment  will also
              prepare students for industrial employment with added  training in
              mechatronics, i.e., integration of system dynamics,  control theory, process
              dynamics and real-time control  implementation.
