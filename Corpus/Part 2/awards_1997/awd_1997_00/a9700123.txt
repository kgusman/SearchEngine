Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Robert Curl of Rice University will   investigate the
              high-resolution infrared spectra of reactive free   radicals using infrared
              kinetic spectroscopy.  The two species of   particular interest are
              propargylene (HCCCH) and hydroxymethyl (CH2OH).    New methods for high
              resolution infrared spectroscopy using difference   frequency mixing of two
              laser sources  will also be developed and   applied.  A sensitive high-speed
              infrared detector based on sum frequency   generation will also be developed.  
               Several sources of laser radiation in rugged, portable form currently   exist
              in the visible and near infrared spectral regions.  The techniques   and
              detectors being developed under this research program will extend the  
              accessible spectral wavelengths into infrared, which is important as a  
              `fingerprint` region where different chemicals can be uniquely   identified. 
              Such radiation sources will be useful in many applications,   from species
              monitoring in refinery and petrochemical industries to   monitoring of the
              environment.  The latter application is particularly   unique because it allows
              high sensitivity detection without requiring   coolants and is not affected by
              large amounts of environmental infrared   background radiation.
