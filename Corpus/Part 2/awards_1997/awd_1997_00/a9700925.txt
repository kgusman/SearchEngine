Abstract    :
              ARTIN, 97-00925        The most important results of the classical theory of
              algebraic  surfaces, which date back to the turn of the last century, 
              characterize the surfaces which contain families of lines: the  rational and
              ruled surfaces.  Recently, some interesting  "quantizations" or deformations of
              these surfaces have been found.  In  these quantizations, the functions on a
              surface are replaced by  operators which do not commute.  It is conjectured
              that the  noncommutative surfaces which are not finite over their centers are 
              precisely the analogues of the rational and ruled surfaces.  The  program of
              research is aimed at carrying the clasqical theory over to  the noncommutative
              case and proving these conjectures.      This is research in the field of
              algebraic geometry and noncommutative algebra. Algebraic  geometry is one of
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a  revolutionary
              flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it  treated figures that
              could be defined  in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials.
              Noncommutative algebra, which has roots in  in matrix theory and in physics,
              combined with classical algebraic geometry  may have applications to modern
              physical theory.
