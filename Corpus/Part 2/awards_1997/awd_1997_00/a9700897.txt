                  Yasuo Amemiya    October 16-18, 1997  Scheman Building, Iowa State
              University, Ames, Iowa 50011    Abstract:    The Department of Statistics at
              Iowa State University, in conjunction   with its 50th anniversary, plans to
              host a conference that will   contribute to the advancement of statistical
              science and to the future   infrastructure of statistics.  The scientific theme
              of the conference   is "Statistics for Correlated Data", which covers many of
              the currently  important theoretical and applied research topics, and which  
              corresponds to the areas of the department's strength and tradition.    The
              plan for the conference is to make it as accessible as possible to   the
              diverse statistics community, and to encourage and support   researchers in
              early stages of their career.    Correlated data arise in modeling temporal and
              spatial processes, in   analyzing repeated measures, in complex sampling and
              experimental   schemes, and in a wide range of applied problems.  In this broad
                subject, researchers tend to form separate groups defined by sub-topics  or
              the areas of application.  This conference attempts to gather   statisticians
              with interest in any of the theoretical or applied   sub-areas of correlated
              data statistics, and to serve as a place for   communicating and exchanging
              knowledge.  Sub-areas covered by the main   theme include time series, spatial
              statistics, sampling, longitudinal   analysis, multivariate analysis,
              applications to engineering, life, and  agricultural sciences.  It is planned
              to have 10-15 invited speakers   from outside Iowa State.  The conference also
              plans to have a special   invited poster session for young researchers.  This
              program will be   announced and advertised widely to obtain a large pool of
              applicants.  At least ten young researchers will be selected as invited  
              participants, and will be feat ured in the poster session.  In addition,  the
              participation of graduate students and young faculty members will   be promoted
              through the network of the Midwest departments of   statistics.
