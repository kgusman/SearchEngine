Abstract    :
              This research project seeks to determine the applicability of using transient
              stress waves generated by short-duration elastic impact to nondestructive
              evaluation of masonry structures.  A preliminary study has established the
              feasibility of using transient stress wave propagation techniques for
              evaluation of masonry and laid the basis for the work to be performed.  The
              objectives are to:  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85
              </fontfamily>demonstrate how acoustic properties of brick, block, mortar, and
              grout affect the impact-echo response of masonry structures; 
              <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>show the effects on
              impact-echo signals due to cores in brick and determine if it is possible to
              test walls made from brick with cores;  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85
              </fontfamily>show the effects on the impact-echo response due to the shrinkage
              cracks at the interfaces between brick and mortar; 
              <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>determine if stress wave
              techniques can be used to establish the degree of mortar joint completeness in
              brick walls; and,  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>determine
              if voids in various types of masonry structures, such as voids in grout joints
              between brick wythes, concrete masonry cells, or in brick pavement systems, can
              be detected.  These objectives will be accomplished through the use of finite
              element simulations of stress wave propagation in models of masonry components
              and structures, extensive laboratory testing on masonry specimens with flaws
              placed at known locations, and field testing on masonry structures where the
              results obtained nondestructively can be verified by invasive testing.  This
              research will provide a fundamental understanding of how stress waves can and
              cannot be used in the nondestructive evaluation of masonry structures.  It will
              result in applications where stress wave techniques can be used for flaw
              detection, quality control, and in pre- and post-event studies.  The results of
              this research will also help address the pressing need to develop techniques
              for nondestructive testing of masonry.  Currently, almost all evaluations must
              be conducted using test methods that in some way damage the structure.=20 With
              success in this research, impact-based stress wave techniques will be an
              important tool for structural engineering consultants in evaluating masonry
              structures.
