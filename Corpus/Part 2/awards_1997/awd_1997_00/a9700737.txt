Abstract    :
              9700737  D'Antonio  This proposal examines the links between biological
              invasions, changes in community composition, and alteration of ecosystem
              processes that contribute to changes in the global nitrogen (N) cycle. The
              objectives of the proposed research are to define mechanisms by which
              non-indigenous grasses in Hawaiian seasonal submontane woodlands have altered
              ecosystem N cycling and how these changes affect N availability to plant growth
              and ecosystem N accumulation. The hypothesis that insertion of grasses
              increases rates of N cycling and decreases rates of loss will be tested by
              comparing N dynamics among unburned woodland with grasses removed, unburned
              woodland with grasses, and burned sites that are grass dominated. Measurements
              of mineral nitrification, soil trace gas emissions, plant production, and
              ecosystem N partitioning using an 15N tracer will be made. This research
              provides a unique link between community and ecosystem processes by addressing
              the role that a new growth form plays in ecosystem N dynamics. This research
              will differentiate mechanisms through which grasses effect N dynamics, and it
              will simultaneously compare the physical, chemical, and competitive effects of
              a growth form on nutrient dynamics. This research also addresses feedbacks
              between growth form of invading species and local rates of resource supply that
              may influence competitive interactions and ultimately, the success of the
              invaders.
