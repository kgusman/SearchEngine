Abstract    :
               McPeek 9700877              This project is designed to understand the
              evolutionary  history of how different groups of frogs have adapted to  their
              environment. Different species of frogs are presently  found in different types
              of ponds: permanent ponds with  fish, permanent ponds without fish, vernal
              ponds that dry  yearly. Closely related species in three frog families  (toads
              (Bufonidae), true frogs (Ranidae), tree frogs  (Hylidae)) segregate among these
              pond types. For example,  the green frog and the bullfrog evolved from a common
               ancestor, yet green frogs are found only in ponds without  fish, and bullfrogs
              are found primarily in ponds with fish.  Previous research has revealed that
              different predators and  competition for food cause this segregation of
              species.        By quantifying traits related to how well tadpoles  evade
              predators and compete with other species, this  project will determine which
              traits are essential for  successfully inhabiting each pond type. Study of the 
              relationships between these traits, pond type and the  evolutionary history of
              species, will also reveal the role  of adaptation (acquiring traits that
              increase survivorship  in a new habitat) in forming the present-day frog fauna.
               This project is important to furthering our understanding  of factors that
              influence the ability of species to utilize  a new habitat.
