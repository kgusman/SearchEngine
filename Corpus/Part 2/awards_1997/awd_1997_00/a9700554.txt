Abstract    :
                Brian D. Marx    Abstract  This workshop's friendly and supportive academic
              atmosphere   brings together scientists from different nationalities,
              backgrounds   and experiences. The workshop will concentrate on various aspects
                of statistical modelling, including theoretical developments,   applications
              and computational methods, and encourages papers   that are motivated by real
              practical problems and that make a   novel contribution to the subject.
              Theoretical contributions   addressing problems of practical importance or
              related to software   developments are also welcome. The scientific program is 
               characterized by having one hour invited lectures & tutorials   presenting new
              developments,contributed papers, posters and   software demonstrations. There
              are no parallel sessions.   Contributed papers should be suitable for a 30
              minute oral   presentation (including discussion) and focus on motivation,  
              statement of key results and conclusions, and emphasize examples,   wherever
              possible. Papers and posters will be refereed by the   scientific committee and
              accepted papers and posters will be   printed in a proceedings volume that will
              be ready for the   start of the conference.     The first call for papers will
              be September 1, 1997 with a   closing date of February 10, 1998. Notification
              of acceptance   will be mailed by March 15, 1998.  Major professors should  
              encourage their students to attend this workshop. The program   is designed to
              allow plenty of time for discussion and   interchange between junior and senior
              scientists.  Additionally one paper session will be devoted entirely to 
              contributions from students. This session will be judged by   the scientific
              committee and an award will be given to the   winner of the Best Student Paper
              at the conference dinner   on Thursday evening (July 30, 1998).    The workshop
              language is English.
