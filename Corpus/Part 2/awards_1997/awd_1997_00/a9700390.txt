Abstract    :
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program support of this research project   will
              enable the further development of near field scanning optical   microscopy
              (NSOM) for the study of organic thin films.  Professor Barbara   and his
              students at the University of Minnesota will study the mesoscopic   structure
              of important non-linear optically active materials, and other   organic thin
              film materials. The connection between mesoscopic structure   and electronic
              and optical properties of these materials will be   determined, with wide
              ranging applications to the development of   optoelectronic materials resulting
              from this work.  The connection between the mesoscale structure and the
              function of   organic thin film materials is very poorly understood, primarily
              because   of the lack of methods available for the determination of the
              structure   of these materials on this scale.  The development of a method for
              this   structural characterization is the focus of this research project.  Near
                fields canning optical microscopy in the fluorescence detection mode will  
              be developed and applied to the study of a range of organic thin film  
              materials with applications in optoelectronic device design.
