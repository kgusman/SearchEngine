Abstract    :
              This project implements a molecular genetics laboratory course.  A course
              addition of this type enriches the laboratory offerings in the Biology
              Department.  There are three primary goals to the project.  The first goal is
              to teach students the basic biological and biochemical principles underlying
              molecular genetic techniques.  The second goal is to give students practical
              experience in a variety of up-to-date molecular genetic techniques.  These
              techniques can be used to examine the genetics of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model
              research organism for the study of the molecular genetics of plant growth and
              development.  The third goal is to introduce the students to a sample of
              research programs that utilize molecular genetics and familiarize the students
              with careers in molecular genetics.  The first two goals can be accomplished
              through the use of lecture and laboratory sections.  The third goal of exposing
              students to graduate and career options can be accomplished through the current
              departmental seminar series, through which researchers in the field of
              molecular genetics are invited to campus to discuss their work.
