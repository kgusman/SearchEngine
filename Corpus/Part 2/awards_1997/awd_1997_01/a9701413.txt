Abstract    :
              9701413  Springer     This award will provide funds for materials and supplies
              to enhance the  dissertation research of Ms. Angela Burk, a doctoral student at
              the University of California - Riverside who is working under the supervision
              of Dr. Mark Springer.  Ms. Burk's dissertation research involves acquisition of
              DNA sequences from three mitochondrially-encoded genes (12S rRNA, valine tRNA,
              and 16S rRNA) and one nuclear-encoded gene (protamine P1) from a representative
              of all living genera of Macropodidae.  Macropodids consist of kangaroos,
              wallabies, and rat-kangaroos, and are the most species-rich group of all known
              marsupials.  The groups contains 62 living species that occupy a wide diversity
              of habitats, including tropical rain forests, alpine tussock grasslands, and
              arid inland plains.  Numerous attempts have been made previously to unravel the
              phylogenetic history of Macropodidae, but thus far complete resolution has not
              been obtained.  Ms. Burk's research will establish such a phylogenetic
              framework and, in addition, will provide estimates of divergence times of
              examined taxa.  Her research also will examine the historical development of
              several morphological characters and character complexes, address questions
              regarding rates of evolution (divergence) of each gene, and evaluate different
              character-weighing approaches for phylogenetic inference. Support for training
              of graduate students in modern technologies is critical to maintain the
              workforce of scientists capable of addressing questions and issues in global
              biology.
