Abstract    :
              9701797  Pinkel      This research project is a key component of a large,
              coordinated, multi-investigator program called SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget of
              the Arctic) Ocean. The SHEBA program will simultaneously measure, over an
              annual cycle, the various fluxes and properties of the atmosphere, ice pack,
              and upper ocean that determine the aggregate mass and energy budgets of Arctic
              sea ice. Its goal is improved understanding of how and to what extent, the ice
              covered   Arctic Ocean affects climate variability in lower latitudes and in
              global climate models (GCMs).  Towards that goal, two   potentially important
              radiation/climate feedback processes have been singled out for study:
              Ice-Albedo Feedback and Cloud-Radiation Feedback. This proposal addresses an
              oceanographic component of SHEBA dealing with ice-albedo feedback mechanisms.
              Two specially constructed acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP)s will be
              deployed to investigate the roles of wind and ocean currents in moving ice from
              place to place. A Deep Profiling System consists   of a 140 kHz, four beam
              coded pulse sonar. This will profile to 400 m with 3 m spatial resolution. It
              will provide an accurate picture of the Ekman layer, the deep mixed layer, meso
              and   large scale flows. A second, five beam 560 kHz Flux Sonar deployed from
              the ice, will provide direct estimates of the turbulent momentum flux in the
              under-ice boundary layer. When coupled with co-located measurements of
              temperature and salinity, turbulent heat fluxes can be estimated as well. The
              intention is to run these two instruments for the full 12-13 month duration of
              the SHEBA camp.  The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow
              refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will
              lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice
              cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
              dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
