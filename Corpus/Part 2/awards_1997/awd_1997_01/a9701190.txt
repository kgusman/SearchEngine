Abstract    :
              9701190  WOLF    Bees vary in their choice of pollen plants.  Generalists are
              bees that collect pollen from many plant species, while specialists collect
              pollen from only a few related plants. Biologists do not fully understand why
              some bees are generalists, whereas others specialize.  Bee pollen choice is
              important for several reasons. First, many native  plants depend on pollination
              by particular bees for seed set.  Additionally, some native bees are used as
              crop pollinators, and many others hold such potential.    In this research,
              Paul Wolf and doctoral candidate Sedonia Sipes will study pollen choice in
              Diadasia, a genus of specialist bees whose members specialize on different
              plant families.  Many species visit only plants in the mallow family; others
              specialize on cacti or  sunflowers.  It is unknown when, or how often, these
              changes in host specialization have occurred during the history of this bee
              genus.  The researchers will use DNA analysis to determine how Diadasia species
              are related, to infer the frequency and order of host-switching.  They will
              also quantify the degree to which Diadasia  are restricted to their preferred
              hosts.  Finally, the researchers will examine morphological characteristics
              that may be adaptive to specialized pollen collection.  The work should add to
              the understanding of specialization in bees, and provide some of the basic
              information needed to evaluate the potential of these bees for crop
              pollination.
