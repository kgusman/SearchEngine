Abstract    :
              9701403  Ryan  The research component of this CAREER award addresses several
              important topics in the area of sequential decision making.  Decision makers
              are often faced with making a sequence of decisions about a system over a
              possibly infinite horizon, with inherent uncertainty in the environmental
              conditions influencing the system state.  Standard multiperiod decision-making
              techniques are often inadequate in integrating forecast information for future
              time periods with the decision made in the current time period.  This research
              is focused on integrating a general and flexible forecasting approach with a
              rolling horizon procedure that iq modeled as a Markov decision process.  The
              research objectives are to:  (1) determine appropriate lengths and formulations
              of the finite deterministic subproblems to account for forecast uncertainty,
              (2) assess the effect of each level of approximation on the long term cost of
              the decisions, and (3) gauge the effect of forecast revisions.  The proposed
              educational activities are intended to improve student understanding and
              retention at the undergraduate level through the use of active and cooperative
              learning strategies, and enhance teaching effectiveness by participation in a
              project on the peer review of teaching.    The use of sequential
              decision-making for long- (or infinite-) term planning projects under
              uncertainty arise in a number of different contexts.  For example, electric
              utilities must deliver power to customers over an infinite horizon, with
              uncertainty in the demand for electricity over time.  Manufacturing concerns
              must allocate funds for capacity expansion over time based on uncertain demand
              estimates.  This research should have an impact on our ability to better make
              decisions over long planning horizons.  Moreover, the educational component
              should have a positive impact on the engineering infrastructure, encouraging
              interdisciplinary and team-thinking among undergraduate students.
