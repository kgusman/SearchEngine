              Diego    Title: "Dissertation Research: Causes and consequences of  asymmetric
              sound fields in animal communication"    Studies of acoustically mediated mate
              choice, including  previous studies of  the sage grouse, have concentrated on
              the role of spectral  and temporal  signal composition as predictors of mating
              success.  Using a  technique that  we developed for the study of acoustic
              radiation,  researchers have identified  another acoustic trait that almost
              certainly has strong  fitness  consequences.  Preliminary results of pilot data
              taken last  spring reveal  starkly asymmetric and directional sound radiation
              fields  unlike any  previously observed in a vertebrate.  These results also 
              strongly suggest  that male sage grouse have a novel and remarkable mechanism 
              to control this  directionality.  The research proposed here is designed to 
              further  elucidate the mechanism of sage grouse vocalization  radiation and
              pattern  manipulation in the context of male sage grouse mating  success.    .
