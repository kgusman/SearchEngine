Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to investigate extensions of a design methodology 
              for a class of low noise integrated oscillators in the applications areas of 
              telecommunications, high speed microprocessors, and oversampled data
              conversion.   The goal of the teaching plan associated with this research is
              for the Analog  Microelectronics Laboratory to become an integral resource for
              educating both  undergraduates and graduate students in the complete integrated
              circuit design  process.  This project will improve the design of analog and
              mixed signal  integrated circuits for telecommunication systems in which
              system-level  performance is ultimately limited by fundamental circuit-level
              considerations.   A critical component in any integrated communication system
              is an oscillatory  that provides a time/frequency reference for the data
              transmission and detection  process.  The broad class of ring oscillators offer
              many advantages for  integrated oscillator design, but until recently there
              were no procedures  available to design for a desired level of noise
              performance.  This project is  based on a new design methodology for ring
              oscillators that has been proven  successful to the frequencies up to 155 MHz
              in a bipolar IC process.  The goal  is to extend and broaden the low jitter
              oscillator design techniques to higher  speed in the GHz range, reduced supply
              voltage of 3.3V and below, and other  fabrication technologies including CMOS.
