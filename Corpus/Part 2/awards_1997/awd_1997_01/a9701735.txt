Abstract    :
              9701735  Shelton    This experimental research program focuses on distinct
              classes of  materials that display competing collective spin states.  There is
              an  emphasis on materials that have an inter-relationship among their 
              crystallographic properties and their collective behaviors that are  manifested
              at room temperature and below.  To determine the intrinsic  physical
              properties, the research stresses experiments on high-quality  single crystals.
               Two families form the core of these studies; namely,  spin  Peierls and spin
              gap compounds such as CuGeO3, CaV4O9 and derivative  compounds   and   colossal
                magneto-resistive   compounds   such   as  (La,Ca,Bi)MnO3,  Eu14MnSb11   and 
               related  materials.   To  ensure  consistency   and  uniformity in 
              interpreting   the   experimental  results,   a   great   variety   of 
              complementary  experiments will be performed on the same single crystals.  %%% 
              This  experimental  research  program  focuses  on  two  families   of 
              materials  that  show  great  promise  for  technological  applications  and 
              are  associated  with distinctive magnetic properties; namely, spin gap and
              colossal  magneto-resistive (CMR) compounds.  Some examples are CuGeO3, CaV4O9,
               (La,Bi)MnO3, and Eu14MnSb14.  These materials are attracting great  attention
              from the magnetic recording industry.  Due to the intrinsic  complexity  of 
              these  multi-component materials,  great  emphasis  is  placed on  using  the 
              highest  quality  crystals  in  this  study.   Goals  with  practical  aspects
              include:  elemental substitutions to optimize the performance  characteristics;
               discovery of new materials  to  raise  the  critical  operating  temperatures
              of the CMR compounds.  ***
