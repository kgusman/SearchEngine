Abstract    :
              Abstract        DBI 9750297  Julie M. Stone    This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for
              1997.  This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain 
              additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue
              innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular,
              cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any
              area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the
              National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and
              training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and 
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Pathogen  resistance as a model
              system for the perception of  environmental signals in plants."  To gain a
              better  understanding of plant responses to environmental signals,  mutants in
              the pathogen resistance signal transduction  pathway of Arabidopsis thaliana
              are being identified using  genetic selections based on a pathogen-responsive
              promoter  fused to selectable marker genes.  Mutants are being  characterized 
              with respect to altered expression of  pathogen-regulated genes, and the
              identity of the mutated  genes ultimately determined using positional map-based
               cloning techniques.  An avirulent strain of  Pseudomonas  syringae and the
              RSP2 gene are being used in this study.
