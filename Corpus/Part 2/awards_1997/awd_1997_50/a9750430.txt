Abstract    :
              During the past 25 years, video microscopy and digital imaging have
              revolutionized light microscopy, and personal computers have changed how
              classes are taught.  Until now, the Biology Department has lacked the resources
              to make digital image acquisition and analysis an integral part of its
              curriculum.  The department is now acquiring light microscope and computer
              resources to make this integration possible.  Using a variety of devices light
              microscopes coupled, through video cameras, to Macintosh computers with video
              frame-grabber boards; a video camera in a gel documentation system; a
              digitizing tablet; and a scanner students are digitizing images and then
              processing and analyzing them.  Some of the processed images are being used as
              the basis of electronic laboratory reports and serving as references for other
              students.  Faculty, with the help of undergraduate Macintosh experts, are
              initiating the use of the instruments in two of the department's four core
              courses and two upper-level elective courses, helping other faculty in the core
              courses learn how to use the instruments, and supervising the use of the
              instruments by students doing independent research.  The project involves all
              biology majors, all of the college's pre-healing arts students, and many
              students majoring in other science departments.  It is equipping students and
              faculty with powerful new skills and helping others expand their uses of this
              technology.  Students often work in groups at the workstations, so the project
              also encourages collaborative learning.  *
