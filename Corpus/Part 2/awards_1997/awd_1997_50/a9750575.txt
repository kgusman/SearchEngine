Abstract    :
              A course in "Chemical Structure Determination" is being designed for non-science
              majors.  The course in organic structure determination has no prerequisites
              other than a high school chemistry course.  It is laboratory intensive and
              requires problem solving skills, the application of logic, hands-on data
              acquisition and interpretation, teamwork, and oral and written communication
              skills.  Students are gaining hands-on experience with modern instrumental
              methods and the use of technology in solving scientific problems.  An infrared
              spectrophotometer, an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotomer, and a gas
              chromatograph interfaced with a mass spectrometer, along with an existing 60
              MHZ nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, are being used in the course.  The
              course is also forcing students to recognize the interdisciplinary nature of
              science, as all of the laboratory experiments and projects are serving as a
              bridge to phenomena in related fields.  The course satisfies a portion of the
              field of study requirements in the natural sciences required in the curriculum.
               In addition, the instrumentation is being used in the annual workshop for high
              school teachers and students which is offered in the summer as part of the
              outreach program to the region.  *
