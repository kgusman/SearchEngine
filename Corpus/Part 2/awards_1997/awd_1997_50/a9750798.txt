Abstract    :
              Anatomy 1, the human anatomy course at Chabot College, is currently taught using
              cat dissection and models.  One human cadaver is used by almost five hundred
              students.  A student success rate of about 60% over the past five years and
              loss of specific groups of students within the three course health science
              sequence is an indication that we are not meeting the special needs of some of
              out students.  Some steps have been taken to address these issues including
              implementation of prerequisites for the course and a planned purchase of six
              computers and software to be shared by physiology and anatomy students.  In
              addition, the college has agreed to purchase three computers and sets of
              software for exclusive use by anatomy students.    The proposed project takes
              the next step.  The objectives of this project are to increase student
              retention and success in the anatomy course by making instruction as concise
              and direct as possible and by offering more opportunities for individualized
              instruction, increasing access to the Internet to promote student-based
              experimental inquiry, replacing cat dissection with computerized and cadaver
              dissection, and by enhancing histological studies with computerized
              micrographs.  The equipment needed to enable us to meet out objectives includes
              5 Pentium computers with carts and security packages, 5 sets of CD-ROM
              software, and a LEICA-EWS software program.
