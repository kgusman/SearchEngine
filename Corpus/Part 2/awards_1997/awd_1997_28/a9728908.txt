Abstract    :
                    Fertilized eggs become multicellular through a series of rapid,
              synchronous cell divisions, or cleavages, that serve to populate the egg's
              volume with zygotic nuclei, clonally segregate the egg' s developmental
              potential, and reduce daughter cells' volume to that of somatic cells. In
              animal cells, cleavage furrowing is generally recognized to be a
              microfilament-dependent process. Recently, however, Dr. Danilchik discovered a
              novel microtubule-containing array in the early cleavage furrows in eggs of the
              frog Xenopus laevis. This structure consists of numerous thick, short bundles
              of radially arranged, acetylated microtubules that emanate from the vicinity of
              the contractile ring of all cleavage furrows until the midblastula stage. Dr.
              Danilchik hypothesizes that the microtubule array functions to recruit membrane
              vesicles to the site of new membrane formation at the furrow's leading edge.
              Since all receptor-mediated, cell-cell interactions depend on the composition
              of the membranes deposited between cells, it is clear that the directed
              membrane deposition and ingression have potentially significant roles in events
              of early development, such as specification of the primary tissue layers. The
              specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to examine in further detail the
              composition of the FMA via confocal immunocytochemistry, to determine whether
              the FMA arises as a de novo MT structure; 2) to learn the polarity of MTs in
              the FMA and the midzone; 3) to test whether vesicle movements in the vicinity
              of the new' cleavage membrane depend on an intact FMA; and 4) to test the role
              of known MT motor proteins in new membrane delivery.
