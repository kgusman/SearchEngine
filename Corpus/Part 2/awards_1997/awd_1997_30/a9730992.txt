Abstract    :
              9730992  Key    This award supports a three-year collaborative research  project
              between Professor Jennifer Key, Department of  Mathematical Sciences at Clemson
              University, and Professor  Jamshid Moori, Department of Mathematics at the
              University  of Natal in South Africa.    The investigators will explore the
              possibilities for various  classes of designs, especially those associated with
              good  codes and finite geometrics with large automorphism groups.  Professors
              Key and Moori will also study the links among the  theories of designs, codes,
              and groups, especially the use  of algebraic coding theory and group theory, in
              the  investigation and classification of combinatorial designs,  with a
              particular emphasis on designs and codes arising from  finite geometrics. The
              proposed collaboration combines  Professor Key's expertise in group theory and
              problems  associated with the classification of designs and their  codes with
              Professor Moori's expertise in the theory of  finite groups and their
              representations.  The Division of  International Programs and the Division of
              Mathematical  Sciences are jointly providing funding for this project.
