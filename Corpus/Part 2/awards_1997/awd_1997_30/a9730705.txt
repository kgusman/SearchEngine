Abstract    :
                Project Abstract   Recent research has documented a dramatic increase in the
              college wage premium -- the ratio of the average wage of college graduates to
              that of high school graduates -- as well as increasing inequality among college
              educated workers.  Significant variation in the wages of college graduates
              remains unexplained.  This Research Planning Grant is made in support of a
              project that uses the 1993 National Survey of College Graduates to examine the
              effect of field of study on earnings and the wage structure.  This unusually
              rich data set contains observations on college major, occupation, actual work
              experience, and salary and can be used to augment our understanding of the
              effect of higher education on earnings.   The research begins by examining
              whether field of study accounts for the increase in earnings inequality among
              college graduates.  If so, inequality measures that control for field of study
              should be smaller than those observed for all college graduates.  The research
              then considers whether of field of study and primary work activity narrow the
              unexplained gender wage gap.  Finally, the study addresses the effect of
              self-selection on estimates of the returns to college major.
