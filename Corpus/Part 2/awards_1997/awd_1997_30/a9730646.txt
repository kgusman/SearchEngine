Abstract    :
              9730646  Elgaaly    Brick and concrete block masonary infill walls are used 
              extensively in steel frame buildings.  They are often  considered as
              non-structural elements. Which has led to poor  performance of infilled frame
              structures when subjected to  strong lateral forces.  Observations of
              post-earthquake  damages indicate their vulnerability.  A retrofitting 
              technique that is easy to apply and that enhances the  strength and deformation
              characteristics of infill masonary  walls could potentially reduce the number
              of failures of  infilled frames under earthquake loading.    Existing retrofit
              techniques have several disadvantages such  as considerable increase in
              building weight, difficulties  for connection to existing buildings, and high
              construction  cost.  In this project, a new technique for retrofitting  infill
              hollow masonry walls utilizing external reinforcement  with Fiberglass
              Composite Laminates (FCL) is proposed.  It  had several advantages over the
              existing techniques.    A quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of FCL
              as a  retrofitting technique for steel frames infilled with hollow  concrete
              masonry walls will be conducted.  Characterization  of material properties of
              reinforced infill masonry walls  will be obtained and used for the analysis and
              design of  retrofitted infilled frames under seismic loads.  Further  testing
              and analytical studies will be conducted to examine  the interaction between
              the steel frame and the reinforced  infill wall.  Through this effort the
              effectiveness of FCL  will be demonstrated and its use as a retrofitting
              material  to enhance the seismic performance of existing infilled  frame
              buildings will be advanced.  ***
