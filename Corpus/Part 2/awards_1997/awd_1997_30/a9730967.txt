Abstract    :
                9730967  Sims    Temporal   constraints  on  mid-ocean  ridge  basalt   (MORB)
               magmatism  both  on-  and off-axis are critically  needed  to  better 
              understand problems associated with MORB petrogenesis  and  the  processes  of 
              crustal accretion  at  the  MOR.  At  present,  several  fundamental  questions
               related   to   the  temporal  component of MORB magmatism remain unanswered, 
              for  example: 1) How does crustal residence time affect the degree  of  crystal
              fractionation of MORBs and what is the time scale  of  this residence? 2) Is
              MOR magmatism and crustal accretion  focused  at  the axis or is there a
              significant component  of  off-axis  volcanism?  To better understand how the 
              chemistry  of MORB varies through space and time as a function of source 
              chemistry,   melt  generation  and  transport,  and   crustal  fractionation 
              we  will be measuring U-series  disequilibria,  major-    and   trace-element  
              compositions   and   isotopic  compositions  (Nd, Sr and Pb) in a spatially and
              geologically  well-characterized, two-dimensional grid of MORB samples from 
              the  9 50'N area of the EPR.   Knowing the eruption ages  for  these axial
              samples is unique with respect to most deep ocean  basalt  suites  and 
              eliminates a large  uncertainty  in  the  interpretation of the U-series
              measurements.  This  zero  age  suite  also  provides  an important baseline 
              from  which  to  evaluate the off-axis samples whose ages are not known.
