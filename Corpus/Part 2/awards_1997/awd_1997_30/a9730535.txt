              Beaucage, Asst. Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, PI          
              S.E. Pratsinis, Professor of Chemical Engineering, Co-PI     University of
              Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH  45221-0012       The goal of this project is to
              investigate the feasibility of novel, room temperature process for synthesis of
              nanoparticles by carrying our sol-gel reactions in the aerosol phase.  A first
              experimental base will be created with silica and titania nanoparticles.  
              Preliminary experiments have resulted in pure silica nanoparticles (by mass
              spectroscopy) with specific surface areas comparable to aerogels.  These
              analyses show primary particles smaller than 1.5 nm in diameter aggregated into
              classical diffusion-limited-aggregates of approximately 30nm with a mass
              fractal dimension close to 2.5.  Such aggregates have long been sought in the
              hope of developing catalysis supports with the maximum possible surface area. 
              Conventional pyrolytic methods (e.g. flame reactors) are not capable of such
              morphologies since the primary particles are about an order of magnitude
              larger.    The proposed process involves an exceedingly simple and cost
              effective approach which borrows from both sol-gel chemistry and laminar flow,
              pyrolytic (flame) aerosol techniques.  In preliminary experiments, sol-gel
              precursors such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) along with other reactants are
              dispersed in the gas phase in a closely controllled mode using a flow chamber
              similar to those encountered in flame reactors.  Here, however, there is no
              flame and the entire apparatus is constructed form PVC plastic tubing, rather
              than quartz of alloys, costing only about $100. In spite of the simplicity of
              the initial set-up, some degree of control has already been achieved on the
              nanoscale by variation of the precursor concentration, type and flow rates.
