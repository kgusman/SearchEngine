Abstract    :
              9730045  Bash    This awards supports the participation of 12 US scientists in a
              US-South Africa Workshop: The Hobby-Eberly Telescope as a Model for the
              Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), which is scheduled for March 1998 in
              Cape Town, South Africa.  The principal investigator and workshop co-organizer
              is Dr. Frank N. Bash, Director of the McDonald Observatory, University of Texas
              at Austin.  The South African co-organizer is Dr. Bob Stobie, Director of the
              South African Astronomical Observatory, Sutherland, South Africa.  The US
              participants will include astronomers who were involved in the project to build
              the Hobby Eberly Telescope and representatives of private companies that built
              the equipment.  The South African participants include astronomers and
              representatives from industry likely to be involved in the SALT project.    The
              Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) is a collaboration among the University of Texas
              at Austin, Pennsylvania State University, Stanford University,
              Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, and Georg-August University in
              Gottingen.  The telescope has a special design in which it is configured to do
              astronomical spectroscopy, is restricted to see only about 80 percent of the
              available sky, and is able to follow (track) celestial objects for only about
              one hour.  However, the HET has a primary mirror with a diameter of 11 meters
              (433 inches) and costs $13.5 million without instruments.  Comparable
              telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, (the Keck Telescopes) cost about $85 million
              each.  The purpose of the workshop is to discuss the possibility of using the
              HET as a model for a new Southern African Large Telescope at Sutherland.  This
              award is cofunded with the Division of Astronomy.
