Abstract    :
              9730305  Ait-Sahalia    Interest rates have traditionally been modeled in the
              economics literature as following continuous-time Markov processes, and more
              specifically diffusions.  By contract, recent term structure models often imply
              non-Markovian continuous-time dynamics.  Can discretely sampled interest rate
              data help decide which continuous-time models are sensible?  Within the
              Markovian world, diffusion processes are characterized by the continuity of
              their sample paths.  It is immediately obvious that this condition cannot be
              verified from the observed sample path.  By nature, even if the sample path
              were continuous, the discretely sampled interest rate data will appear as a
              sequence of discrete changes.  This is a fundamental and very important problem
              in financial economics.  This project examines whether the discontinuities
              observed in the discrete data are the result of discreteness of sampling, or
              rather evidence of genuine non-diffusion dynamics of the continuous-time
              interest rate process.  The issue is to isolate the observable implications for
              the data of being an incomplete discrete sample from a continuous-time
              diffusion.  The project relies on testing a necessary and sufficient
              restriction on the condition densities of diffusions, at the sampling interval
              of the observed data.  This restriction characterizes the continuity of the
              unobservable complete sample path.  This project investigates the distribution,
              consistency and power properties of the test statistics.  The tests will be
              implemented empirically.            ??
