Abstract    :
              INT 9724783  Babuska    This U.S.-Czech mathematics project between Ivo Babuska
              of the University of Texas, Austin, and Michal Krizek of the Czech Mathematics
              Institute, Prague, will examine the problem of reliability in computational
              mathematics as it relates to mathematical models, available information used in
              such models (data), and the numerical procedures employed.  Overall, this
              collaboration should yield work that will improve our ability to make
              engineering decisions based on the outcome of numerical computations.    Using
              a stochastic approach and a worst case approach, the researchers intend to
              analyze the reliability of the numerical solution(s) by an a-posteriori
              estimation on the basis of the superconvergence theory.  (The worst case
              approach involves working with a given set of admissible input data to find
              bounds for the information of interest.)  Specifically, this project will test:
              1) reliability of mathematical formulations with respect to engineering
              decisions; and 2) reliability of computed data of engineering importance that
              is derived by a numerical solution of the mathematical problem.  Results are
              expected to be directly applicable to practical engineering calculations such
              as those associated with plasticity; elastoplastic torsion; and the Signorini
              contact problem with approximate friction.    This applied mathematics project
              fulfills the program objective of advancing basic scientific knowledge by
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interest
              and competence.  ??
