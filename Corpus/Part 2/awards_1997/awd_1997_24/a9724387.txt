Abstract    :
              9724387  Hauser    The semiconductor industry's National Technology Roadmap for
              Semiconductors (NTRS) is predicated on the continuing shrink of a planar
              silicon integrated circuit manufacturing technology.  Although the NTRS
              forecasts that an ultimate shrink to 70 nm gate length and 4 nm oxide thickness
              in YEAR 2010 will provide on-chip clock frequencies of 1 Ghz and an integration
              density of 0. 9 x 108 cm-2 for microprocessors and 0. 64 X 1011CM-2 for DRAM,
              demands of the marketplace will require that performance continue to increase
              beyond these limits in future years.  Both the semiconductor industry and the
              Department of Defense have recently recognized this requirement, and both are
              reacting to urge continued investment in research to achieve this more
              aggressive objective.    NCSU's Advanced Electronic Materials Processing Center
              (AEMP) has been conducting leading edge research relevant to this objective
              under the sponsorship of both the National Science Foundation (NSF) through an
              ERC and the Semiconductor Research Corporation through a SEMATECH Center of
              Excellence and now a Materials and Bulk Processing Research program.  Through
              collaboration with semiconductor industry partners, NCSU has made considerable
              impact on industry's technology advances.  Recently, AEMP has explored the
              issues related to the use of the vertical or third dimension for integrated
              circuit fabrication, a departure from the NTRS roadmap.  It may be possible by
              this approach to dramatically improve both circuit performance and functional
              circuit density.  Thus, new and more aggressive research goals have been
              defined that are aligned with the new national need.    One key to the
              accomplishment of these new goals is the ability to planarize and smooth the
              surface following each of the third dimension processing steps.  For this
              process, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is the optimum solution.  This
              proposal describes the need for this capability and requests funds for the
              purchase of equipment to establish this  capability within the AEMP.  Funds are
              requested for the purchase of three equipment items: (1) a chemical mechanical
              polishing tool, (2) a double sided wafer cleaner for use after CMP and, (3) an
              AFM metrology tool.  All three items are needed to provide the support for
              future research looking at applications of CMP to front end of the line silicon
              IC manufacturing processes.  ***
