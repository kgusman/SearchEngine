Abstract    :
              9724568  Bloxham    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation 
              (MRI) Program, provides $178,885 as partial support of the  costs of acquiring
              a new computational facility at Harvard  University for modeling the Earth's
              dynamo using their  recently developed 3-d, dynamically self-consistent 
              geodynamo code.  Specifically, they will acquire a new  Silicon Graphics Origin
              2000 server with sixteen CPU's, 45  Gb of disk storage and 2 Gb of expanded
              memory. The current  Kuang and Bloxham (Harvard) 3-d geodynamo model and the 
              Glatzmaier (LANL) and Roberts (UCLA) model, whose results  have recently been
              featured on the covers of the  international and multi-disciplinary journals
              Nature and  Science, are the only two currently developed and functional 
              models of the geodynamo in the world. The Kuang-Bloxham  model simulates a
              magnetic field that is generated well  above the inner core close to the
              core-mantle boundary,  while the Glatzmaier-Roberts model predicts a field 
              generated just above the inner core.  Both models show  dipole reversals after
              a few decay times and the Glatzmaier-  Roberts model, which was developed first
              and has been run  long enough to simulate other geomagnetic reversals at ca. 
              100,000 ybp and 200,000 ybp, is supported by the Earth's  paleomagnetic
              reversal records.  The difference between  these models lies in the setup of
              boundary conditions and  choice of initial parameters for each of the models
              and the  geophysical basis for each model representation can be and  is,
              argued.  Given limited computational resources for this  research, both groups
              are forced to make simplifications to  the models that result in codes that can
              be run in a  reasonable amount of time (the Kuang-Bloxham model currently 
              requires one month of dedicated time on their CARY computer  for simulation of
              the Earth's dynamo for only one decay  time).  Given these limitations,
              unrealistic values of  initial parameters are used (i.e. Ekman number, Prandtl 
              number, Rayleigh number; see rev iew by Merrill).  However,  it is clear that
              increased parallel processing and memory  are required to run this code within
              reasonable lengths of  time to model the Earth's geodynamo over geologically 
              significant time periods and it is important to support  continued development
              and subsequent simulations using both  of these competing models.  ***
