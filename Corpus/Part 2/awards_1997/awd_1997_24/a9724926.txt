Abstract    :
              9724926  Singh    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              and engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Structural Control  for Civil
              Infrastructure Systems, to be held in Kyoto, Japan  from June 28-July 1, l998. 
              The co-organizers are Professors  Mahendra Singh of Virginia Polytechnic
              Institute and Yutaka  Inoue of Osaka University in Japan.  The seminar will
              focus  on innovative concepts involving new algorithms, sensors,  actuators and
              dampers.  They will also discuss some full  scale trial implementation of
              active control devices in  Japan, primarily for low level disturbances.   
              Session will focus on four theme topics:  (1) active  semi-  active and hybrid
              control, (2) control of buildings, bridges  and lifelines, (3) system
              integration, design philosophies  and code provisions, and (4) case studies and
              experimental  verification on international testbeds.  These will be  followed
              by summarization of the status of the structural  control on these topics in
              order to identify the outstanding  research issues.  They will then formulate
              an action plan  with recommendations for development and implementation. 
              Participants will include younger scientists.  The  proceedings will be
              published and also disseminated through  the internet. The exchange of ideas
              and data with Japanese  experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to 
              advance their own work, and will set the stage for future  collaborative
              projects.  ***
