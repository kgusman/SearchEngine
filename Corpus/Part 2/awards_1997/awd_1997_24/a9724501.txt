Abstract    :
              9724501  Parise    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation 
              (MRI) Program, provides $295,518 as one-half support of the  costs of acquiring
              equipment for development of a modular,  CCD detector-based x-ray diffraction
              facility that will be  used in conjunction with both synchrotron x-ray sources
              at  the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven  National Lab
              (BNL), the Advanced Photon Source (APS),  Argonne National Lab (ANL) and
              laboratory x-ray sources.  Specifically, the equipment will include two CCD
              detector  systems allowing real time x-ray diffraction studies of very  small
              single crystals and powdered samples, a significant  advantage over more
              conventional image plate-based XRD  systems. One of the CCD detector systems
              will be used in  conjunction with a refurbished Rigaku 18 kW rotating anode 
              that will incorporate focusing mirrors to provide an extra  beam and a high
              brightness focused beam for further in-house  development of the T-cup high
              pressure device originally  designed by researchers at the Mineral Physics
              Institute at  SUNY-SB (a node of the CHiPR STC). This modular system will  also
              be transferable to brighter x-ray sources at NSLS and  APS for studies of the
              smallest crystals (0.5 - 20 microns).  A second system will alleviate demand
              for beam time at NSLS  by the many postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate 
              students affiliated with the CHiPR STC who require XRD  analyses on crystals
              ranging in sizes from 20-100 microns  for which current laboratory x-ray
              sources and XRD detector  systems are not adequate.  Additional funds will be
              used to  purchase a workstation and mass storage for analysis of the  high
              resolution diffraction data and ancillary equipment  needed to manufacture this
              integrated modular system.  Specific examples of the cutting edge and funded
              research  that will be enhanced or enabled by this equipment include, 
              development of the next-generation, portable, large volume  high pressure cell,
              determination of the strength and   rheological properties of ceramics,
              textural analysis during  ultrasonic experiments for determination of seismic 
              velocities through high pressure phases, structural analyses  of
              organic-inorganic open framework compounds, powder  diffraction studies of
              doped-fullerenes, solid-state organic  geochemistry, characterization of low
              temperature compounds  formed during early diagenesis in marine sediments and
              bio-  medical studies of photochemically formed natural compounds.  ***
