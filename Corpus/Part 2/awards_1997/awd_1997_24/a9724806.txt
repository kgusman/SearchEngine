Abstract    :
              9724806  Kargon    This award provides support for a workshop on "Techno 
              regions:  Science, Technology and Regional Development Past,  Present and
              Future" which is being organized by Dr. Robert  Kargon of Johns Hopkins
              University and Dr. Alberto Carvalho  da Silva of the University of Sao Paulo.  
               This workshop will gather together U.S. and Brazilian  experts from the areas
              of science and technology studies,  economics, political science, policy
              analysis and geography  to discuss the inter-sectoral relations between
              industry,  government and universities in North and South America.  By  doing
              this, they hope to increase our understanding of the  origins, structure and
              function of these relationships  through the comparison of historical and
              current  developments in the Americas.  They will analyze in  particular, the
              university-industry relations in "techno  regions" such as Silicon Valley,
              Tsukuba Science City in  Japan and Sophia-Antipolis in France and in the
              economy  generally.  With this workshop, the participants will study  policy
              issues surrounding the relationship of research and  development to industrial
              innovation and growth, knowledge  transfer between government, university and
              industry, and  the role of regional factors in science policy.  By doing  this,
              they hope to provide guidance on how to revitalize  older techno-regions in the
              U.S. and Brazil and to engage  with other regions such as Japan, India, Korea,
              Thailand and  Singapore, starting cooperation among researchers in the  U.S.
              and Brazil.  ***
