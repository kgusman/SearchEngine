Abstract    :
              9724465  Duennebier    This project will enhance the safety and utility of an
              undersea   observatory being installed off Hawaii named HUGO - Hawaii Undersea 
               Geo Observatory. The main components of HUGO, including the shore   station,
              main cable installation between the Big Island and Loihi,   and the junction
              box, are being provided by OCE. The 45 km cable   was donated to the University
              by AT&T.  Because Loihi is an active   volcano, and because it is desirable for
              HUGO to survive as long as   possible, the junction box termination of the main
              cable will be   placed in a relatively quiet region about one mile from the
              area   most active during the July-August, 1996, volcanic event.     Funds are
              provided to build and install a HUGO Multiplexing Node   (Mux) to be connected
              to the junction box and placed within the   active area. This Mux will
              immediately provide a connection point   for more than 11 experiments within
              the active area, with a   potential for expanding to an additional 38
              experiments at a later   time. Should Loihi activity destroy individual
              experiments or this   MUX, replacement will be relatively simple compared to
              replacing   many cables back to the junction box.    HUGO will be one of the
              world's first true ocean floor   observatories, supplying the infrastructure
              necessary for   scientists from many disciplines to perform experiments at a  
              particularly interesting and dynamic location. HUGO will have the   potential
              to accommodate more than 60 experiments, supplying 5 kW   of electrical power
              to the summit junction box, and collecting   real-time data over five optical
              fibers at nominal rates of 2,000   samples/sec per experiment over a 45 km
              electro-optical cable.
