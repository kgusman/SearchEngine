Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to support, in part, the Second International Cascade
              Symposium on the Avian Digestive System.  This symposium is a follow up to a
              very successful symposium that was held in the summer of 1988.  The topic of
              the planned symposium is the basic physiology of the avian digestive system, an
              area that has not been summarized since the mid-1980s.  As with the proceedings
              of the 1988 symposium that were published as a supplement to the Journal of
              Zoology, every attempt will be made to have the proceeding of the second
              symposium published.  Through a careful selection of speakers, almost all
              aspects of the avian GI system will be covered in the symposium.  The symposium
              will start with a consideration of the regulation of food intake, and this will
              be followed in sequence by discussions of gastric function, small intestine
              function, function of the digestive ceca, rectal and cloacal function, changes
              of the GI system with diet, and the coordinated function of the kidney and
              lower GI track in the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance.  Thirty-one
              speakers have been invited to participate in the symposium, eleven of which are
              from foreign countries.  In addition to the oral presentations, students and
              others will be offered the opportunity to present data as posters during the
              conference.
