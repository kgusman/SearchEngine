Abstract    :
              9724911  Ferry    This award supports a three year collaborative research 
              project between Professor David Ferry of Arizona State  University and
              Professor Yuichi Ochiai of Chiba University  in Japan.  The researchers will be
              exploring new  applications for nanostructures research.  The objective of the
              collaboration is to study the nature of  quantum transport in nanodevices, in
              particular the quantum  dot structure as it will appear in nanodevices (as an
              "open"  device and not a tunneling device).  They will investigate  the nature
              in which the crossover from classical to quantum  transport occurs.  Through
              studies of the phase coherent  lifetime, they will also investigate the
              conditions under  which quantum mechanical effects can be observed in 
              realistic device structures.     This project brings together the efforts of
              two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and
              equipment.  The collaboration provides a  unique combination of experiment and
              theory.  It is  anticipated that these studies will provide an important 
              insight into those fundamental physical principles which  will determine the
              operation of future generations of room  temperature nanodevices.  Through the
              exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic 
              knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***
