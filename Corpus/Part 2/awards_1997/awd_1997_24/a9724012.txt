Abstract    :
              INT 9724012  Hines        This U.S.-Slovenian research project between Mark
              Hines of the University of Alaska, Anchorage, and Jadran Faganeli of the
              University of Ljubljana, Marine Biological Station, will examine the
              concentration, transport and dynamics of methylmercury in the aquatic
              ecosystems of the Idrija River system.  Findings will be compared with parallel
              research on the Carson River in Nevada.  Similarities and differences in these
              two systems will permit some delineation controls for net methylmercury
              formation and transport models.  Results are expected to improve our ability to
              understand and predict the potential impact on human life and aquatic food
              chains from mercury cycling in rivers.    The objectives of this
              multi-disciplinary investigation include: 1) locating sources and sinks of
              methylmercury; 2) studying bacterial processes such as mercury methylation and
              demethylation, genetic controls, and terminal decomposition processes; 3)
              defining the relationship between the sulfur cycle and mercury methylation and
              demethylation; and 4) examination of the effects of the marine environment on
              the transformation of mercury transported to the sea.  As planned, the full
              effort involves the conduct of a survey along a gradient from pristine sites
              through contaminated regions to help develop a simulation model that can guide
              research and aid in determining how changes in the system may affect
              methylmercury flux and bioaccumulation.    This project in ecology, earth
              sciences and environmental remediation fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence.           ??
