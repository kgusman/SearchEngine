     The principal investigators, James F. Davis and Kent E.
              Orr, are
pursuing several problems in low and high dimensional
              geometric
topology and exploring connections between combinatorics
              and
topology.  The problems in geometric topology include: cases of
              the
Borel/Novikov conjecture and applications of the conjecture to
manifolds
              with infinite fundamental group; the classical topological
knot slice problem,
              including geometrically interpreting old and newly
constructed knot slicing
              obstructions via Whitney tower constructions;
the problem of slicing knots in
              even dimensions and the underlying
homotopy obstructions; and better
              understanding the fundamental
problem of classifying topological
              four-manifolds within a homology
type.  This project also is constructing the
              foundations of the theory
of oriented matroid bundles and their characteristic
              classes.  This
requires deep interactions between two fields, topology
              and
combinatorics and will be a step towards the understanding of a
              new
category of manifolds, the combinatorial differential manifolds
              of
Gelfand-MacPherson.
     All problems in geometric topology have their
              roots in the
understanding of manifolds.  An n-dimensional manifold is a set
              of
points which is locally modeled on an n-dimensional linear space. 
              For
instance, a surface is a locally 2-dimensional linear space.
Space-time
              is locally 4-dimensional, but its global properties are
harder to grasp.  The
              principal problem of geometric topology is the
classification of manifolds. 
              Two manifolds are the same if there is a
continuous function with a continuous
              inverse between the manifolds.
This formalizes the notion of rubber sheet
              topology often discussed in
popular science magazines.  Another natural aspect
              of manifold theory
is the question of how manifolds can sit within other
              manifolds, i.e.,
knot theory.  One pathway to understanding manifolds is
              through the
fundamental group and homology theory, which provides a transition
              from
geometry to algebra.  Another pathway is to approximate geometry
              by
finite structures, which provides a transition from geometry
              to
combinatorics.  The interaction of these fields of mathematics
              reveals
techniques and perspectives that would otherwise be
              invisible.
