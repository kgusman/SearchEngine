Brylinski
     J-L. Brylinski will continue his work on the geometric
              structures
occurring in mathematical physics, particularly in gauge theory,
              loop
spaces, and moduli spaces of vector bundles.  Gauge groups are
              of
fundamental importance in modern geometry.  The gauge groups on a
circle
              are loop groups, and gauge groups in dimension 2 are closely
related to
              conformal field theory.  Brylinski will study certain
cohomology classes he
              has constructed for gauge groups, which are
natural generalizations of the
              degree-two cohomology class giving the
central extension of a loop group. 
              These classes are obtained by a
transgression process from the Chern-Simons
              classes and the Chern
classes of Beilinson.  The first new example is that of
              a degree-three
cohomology class in the gauge group of a closed surface. 
              Brylinski
has shown that these classes obey reciprocity laws that
              generalize
those of conformal field theory.  He will investigate to what
              extent
they are related to higher-dimensional field theories.  He will
              study
the Kaehler geometry of moduli spaces of vector bundles, continuing
his
              work with P. Foth, and intends to study the geometric quantization
of these
              moduli spaces.  Brylinski will also continue his work on the
Quillen metric on
              determinant line bundles, which should lead to
methods to compute it
              geometrically, as opposed to analytically, in
many situations.  Here he will
              use both the differential geometry of
gerbes that he developed and a variant
              of Deligne cohomology he
introduced, which incorporates hermitian metrics. 
              Brylinski will
continue his investigation of the differential geometry of the
              space
of knots in a smooth three-manifold, which he previously showed is
              a
Kaehler manifold, more precisely a union of coadjoint orbits of the
group
              of unimodular diffeomorphisms.  A particular object of study
will be the
              structure of various Lie algebras of functionals with
respect to the Poisson
              bracket.
     The research of J.-L. Brylinski is concerned with the
              interface
between geometry and mathematical physics.  This interface has
              been
growing steadily in the recent past and has had profound
              consequences
for various branches of geometry: algebraic, differential, and
              symplectic,
among others.  For instance, Edward Witten (School of Natural
              Sciences,
Institute for Advanced Study) interpreted the Jones polynomial
for
              knots in terms of field theory in three dimensions connected to
the
              Chern-Simons class.  Also, Verlinde derived a formula for
Riemann-Roch numbers
              of a line bundle over a moduli space of bundles
over a Riemann surface, using
              ideas from conformal field theory.  All
these facts point to the need for new
              types of geometry that include
generalizations of the concept of a vector
              bundle or a principal
bundle.  For this purpose, Brylinski has developed a
              theory of the
differential geometry of groupoids and gerbes, which he is
              applying to
the study of gauge groups, moduli spaces of vector bundles,
              Quillen
line bundles, and the space of knots.  Although the basic concepts
              he
employs are of an abstract nature, they can often lead to
              concrete
formulas.  For instance, he has obtained a concrete description
              of
Quillen metrics on some geometric determinant line bundles connected
with
              line bundles over Riemann surfaces.  This research is expected to
result in a
              better understanding of the geometric underpinnings of
mathematical
              physics.
