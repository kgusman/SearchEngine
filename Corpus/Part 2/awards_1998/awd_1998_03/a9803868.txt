Abstract    :
              9803868
Cannon
     The most important invariant of three-dimensional
spaces
              is the fundamental group.  The investigator and his
coworkers are studying the
              fundamental group of three-
dimensional manifolds asymptotically via the
              recursive
patterns at infinity defined by those groups.  This
              approach
transfers difficult problems about three-dimensional spaces
to
              difficult problems about recursive tiling patterns in 
the two-dimensional
              sphere at infinity.  The patterns 
obtained are very attractive aesthetically
              and seem to
supply deep connections among three-manifold theory, the
geometry
              of three-manifolds, geometric and combinatorial
group theory, circle packing,
              classical complex variable
theory, Teichmueller space theory, and the theory
              of Kleinian
and Fuchsian groups, with potential connections as well to
the
              theories of iterated rational maps, tiling theory, 
Blaschke products,
              Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants, etc.
The initial theory was developed with
              essentially only one
aim in mind, namely to prove the conjecture that a
              discrete
group is Kleinian if and only if it is negatively curved 
in the
              large (in the sense of Gromov) and has the two-dimensional
sphere as its space
              at infinity.  An affirmative solution to this
problem would fill an important
              slot in Thurston's program
to show that all three-manifolds admit a geometric
              structure.
The theory of recursive tilings of the plane and two-sphere
is
              very rich and rewarding and is likely to have applications
well beyond its
              intended target.
     Discrete group theory can be used to model physical
              motion,
geometric symmetries, and biological cell growth.  The
              generic
discrete group is infinite and negatively curved in the
large (Gromov
              and Olshanskii) and has a recursive self-
similarity structure at infinity
              (Cannon).  One might
alternatively say that the generic group casts
              fractal
shadows at infinity.  The investigator and his coworkers
are studying
              this fractal structure at infinity by using
the theory of conformal mappings
              to optimize the geometric
shape of these shadows.  The results have
              application 
to the study of discrete groups, three-dimensional
              spaces,
complex variables, computational group theory, and, potentially,
to
              the theory of biological cell growth.
