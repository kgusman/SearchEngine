Abstract    :
              DMS-9803169    Asymptotic and Statistical Analysis of Volatility and its
              Implications   for Derivative Pricing and Risk Management    K.  Ronnie Sircar 
                In financial mathematics, a methodology (due to Black and Scholes)  exists
              for pricing and hedging against the risk of derivative  securities (eg.
              options) on stocks when the volatility of the stock is  constant. However, it
              is widely believed that volatility has a random  component and must be
              described by a suitable stochastic model. This  project aims to produce a
              statistical description of stock volatility  dynamics using historical price
              data, and to combine it with an  asymptotic analysis of the partial
              differential equation for  derivative prices to infer the market's view of
              probable future stock  movements, and in particular, whether this view has
              become more  pessimistic since the 1987 crash. The analysis will exploit the 
              discrepancy in time-scales of fluctuation between the Brownian motion  driving
              the stock price process and the volatility stochastic process.    The
              spectacular growth in the size of the derivatives market over the  last twenty
              years (currently it has a turnover of trillions of dollars  in the US) plus
              recent infamous (and equally spectacular) risk  (mis)management disasters such
              as the Barings and Orange County  fiascos, have created an urgent need for good
              mathematical and  computational models to quantify the respective risks and
              rewards of  such investments. This project aims to build on the Nobel Prize 
              winning methodology of Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into account  the
              fluctuating nature of market volatility. Mathematical tools are  combined with
              statistical analysis of past prices to produce formulas  and software that
              accurately capture the potential losses and gains in  today's vast derivative
              market.
