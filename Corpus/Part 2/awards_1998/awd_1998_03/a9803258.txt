Frederick Wilhelm proposes to work on three problems.  The first is
              a
program for creating new examples of Riemannian metrics that have lots
of
              positive curvatures.  The metrics are on certain fiber bundles.
The program
              seems particularly likely to succeed for three sphere
bundles over the four
              sphere.  Second he will work on proving his new
conjecture---that the
              dimension of the image of a Riemannian
submersion of a complete, positively
              curved manifold is strictly
greater than half of the dimension of the domain.
              Third he will try to
complete the classification of Riemannian submersions of
              round
spheres.

The three problems all address the general question of how
              does the
curvature of a space effect its geometry and topology? 
              Roughly
speaking, curvature is what determines the trigonometry of a
              space.
For example one can prove that the surface of the earth is curved
              with
out looking at it from outer space.  To do this have two people start
at
              the north pole and travel in any two directions that are
perpendicular to each
              other. If they travel at the same speed, they
will eventually meet again at
              the south pole.  On the other hand, if
the same experiment were conducted on a
              flat world, the two people
would never meet.  They would keep getting further
              apart, even if they
never reached the "edge" of the world.  The main
              justification for
studying this general question is that it seems
              intrinsically
beautiful, intriguing, and natural. It has a long history, that
              dates
back to the 1930's work of H. Hopf, Morse, Schoenberg, Meyers,
              and
Synge.
