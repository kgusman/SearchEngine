     A central theme of geometric group theory is that finitely
              generated
groups can be studied geometrically by attempting to classify them
              up to
quasi-isometry.  In one part of this project, the investigator,
              working
jointly with B. Farb of the University of Chicago, will attempt to
              show
that if G is a finitely generated group that is quasi-isometric to
              a
solvable group, then G is very closely related to some solvable group
              by
simple algebraic operations, with special attention to fundamental
              groups
of 3-dimensional solv-manifolds and other polycyclic groups.  In
              another
part, joint with M. Sageev, the investigator will work on
              constructing
new examples of word hyperbolic groups that have high codimension
              but are
not closely related to arithmetic lattices, a problem posed by M.
              Gromov.
Continuing a long-term effort, the investigator will study the
              following
weak version of W. Thurston's Hyperbolization Conjecture, namely
              that if
M is a compact 3-manifold, then the fundamental group of M is either
              word
hyperbolic or else contains a subgroup isomorphic to a free
              abelian
group of rank 2.  This part will make use of tools developed in
              previous
joint work with U. Oertel as well as new tools of ``coarse
              algebraic
topology'' developed recently by geometric group theorists. 
              Continuing
another long-term effort, the investigator will work on showing
              that if M
is a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, then only finitely many
              different
pseudo-Anosov flows are needed to compute Thurston's norm on the
              second
homology of M.
     Groups are the mathematical abstraction of
              symmetries of geometric
objects.  Symmetry patterns of wallpaper, bathroom
              tiles, and the
tilings on the walls of the Alhambra in Spain give examples of
              Euclidean
symmetry groups.  Many of Escher's paintings give examples either
              of
Euclidean or of hyperbolic symmetry groups.  This project will
              cover
several topics in geometric group theory, the general study of
              geometries
and their symmetry groups.  By matching the large scale properties
              of a
geometry with the large scale properties of its symmetry groups, one
              can
use geometries to study groups and vice versa, a very fruitful
              pairing
that has led to many recent mathematical advances.  The
              investigator,
working with Benson Farb (U Chicago), will study a special class
              of
groups known as ``solvable groups,'' a generalization of
              Euclidean
symmetry groups.  Working with his colleague Michah Sageev, he
              will
investigate new generalizations of hyperbolic symmetry groups.  He
              will
also continue work on long term efforts to understand
              3-dimensional
geometries and their symmetry groups, as well as to study
              3-dimensional
dynamical systems.
