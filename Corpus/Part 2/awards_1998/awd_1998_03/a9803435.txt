Stasheff
     This research is concerned with application of
              techniques Stasheff
developed earlier in his study of classifying spaces and
              rational homotopy
theory and involves his combining of those techniques with
              developments
introduced ad hoc by physicists.  The current project is
              concerned
particularly with three inter-related classes of problems and aims
              at
elucidating their intrinsic structure as well as computation of
              significant
applications:
 (I) homotopy associative differential graded
              algebras and Lie and
commutative analogs, particularly as they occur in
              various physical
field theories,
 (II) the homological aspects of Lagrangian
              and more general exterior
differential systems, both classical and quantum, as
              embodied in the
anti-field formalism of Batalin-Vilkovisky and its
              generalizations,
 (III) deformation theory as giving rise to higher homotopy
              algebra and
as applied to physical systems.  Specific applications are
              projected
to the problems of higher spin particles and of mixed
              open-closed
string field theory.
     Cohomological physics refers to that
              part of mathematical physics,
primarily gauge and other field theories, in
              which a variety of cohomological
techniques are seeing increasing application.
               Recently, further development
of these techniques within the physical context
              has begun to have an effect
on more purely mathematical research, for example,
              providing new applications
of the existing theory of ``higher dimensional
              algebra'' for which
1-dimensional diagrams are inadequate.  Although defined
              in greater and more
abstract generality, such structures, as they occur in or
              are inspired by
mathematical physics, are the focus of this research.  The
              results should
aid in deeper understanding of the mathematical structures
              essential to the
physics (especially of higher spin particles and of mixed
              open-closed string
field theory) and of the inter-relation of physical and
              mathematical
concepts.  The results should also be of independent mathematical
              importance.
