Abstract    :
              This project involves a exploration of all aspects of low dimensional dynamics:
              combinatorial and geometric issues of holomorphic dynamics, its interplay with
              one-dimensional real dynamics (particularly in the rigidity and renormalization
              theories), interaction with three dimensional hyperbolic geometry, and analytic
              and geometric aspects of two dimensional complex and real dynamics.  Particular
              emphasis is given to the key problems of describing the typical asymptotical
              behavior of a typical system and understanding of the mechanisms behind the
              universality phenomenon.

The theory of dynamical systems was founded in the
              works of Poincare' about 100 years ago. It began as a branch of celestial
              mechanics and the study of differential equations, but then developed into an
              important field in its own right. It has developed in a collaboration between
              mathematicians and workers in many other sciences, and has preserved strong
              mutually beneficial connections with natural science including celestial
              mechanics, statistical physics, fluid dynamics, meteorology, engineering,
              chemistry and many other fields.  Since its founding in 1989, IMS has carried
              on an active program of research and education in dynamical systems, and
              related areas of geometry, ergodic theory, and complex analysis, with
              particular emphasis on low dimensional dynamics over the real and complex
              numbers.  It has supported a number of junior and senior visitors, organised
              research and learning seminars, mini-courses and conferences, worked with
              graduate and undergraduate students, incorporated computers into research and
              education, and helped promote communication in the field by production of the
              preprint series and maintaining a dynamics web site.
