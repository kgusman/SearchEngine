     This group project in topology deals with research in a wide
              range
of topics in topology and related areas of algebra, algebraic
              K-theory,
and geometry.  May studies various areas centering on global
              structures
in stable homotopy theory and related fields.  He and his
              collaborators
have opened up stable homotopy theory to serious point-set
              level
algebraic study with their recent new approach to highly structured
              ring
and module theory.  Rings, modules, and algebras can now be defined
              as
objects with well-behaved products in a symmetric monoidal category
              of
spectra, allowing many constructions and applications that were
              not
possible previously.  He and Greenlees have opened up new
              interactions
between equivariant and non-equivariant stable homotopy theory
              with
their analysis of Tate cohomology and their proof of a
              completion
theorem for module spectra over MU.  Rothenberg studies analytic
              and
combinatorial torsion invariants in geometric topology.  He and
              his
collaborators have explored generalizations of the classical
              invariants
to equivariant and non-compact situations and have constructed
              torsion
invariants for fiber bundles with compact fibers, these being
              cohomology
classes rather than just numerical invariants.  Weinberger's work
              centers
on geometry and analysis on compact spaces with singularities and
              on
noncompact manifolds.  His surgery theory on stratified spaces can
              be
applied directly to various problems and has led to a changed
              perspective
on group actions, both in terms of answering old questions and
              in
formulating new ones.  The perspective is completely integrated with
              the
theory of homology manifolds at the level of conjecture, and somewhat
at
              the level of theorem.  Furthermore, detailed analysis of what would
be
              involved in proving such conjectures seems to have deep connections
with
              logic, complexity theory, and non-commutative geometry.
     A major emphasis
              of the project is graduate education.  With three
junior faculty and fifteen
              current graduate students in topology at
Chicago, the topology program
              supported by this grant is one of the
world's largest.  In the three years
              1996-98, it has graduated ten new
PhD's, with 1998-99 jobs at MIT (2),
              Michigan (2), Illinois (2), Berkeley,
CUNY, Rutgers, and Utah.  Students
              supported on the grant work in a wide
variety of areas of algebraic and
              geometric topology, and some of them
work on the interfaces between algebraic
              topology and algebraic geometry
on the one hand and between geometric topology
              and differential geometry
on the other.  Although focused on topology, the
              work supported by this
grant impinges on many other areas of mathematics. 
              Some of it also
impinges on current work in mathematical physics, where the
              kinds of
topological and geometric structures studied by the investigators
              have
direct relevance.
