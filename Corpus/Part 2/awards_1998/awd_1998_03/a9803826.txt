Abstract    :
              9803826  Schultens       This research project concerns the relation of Heegaard
              splittings  to manifold decompositions, a relation that has been studied in a
              particular  case under the guise of tunnel numbers of knots.  The tunnel number
              of a  knot has been shown to behave quite erratically under the operation of 
              connected sum of knots.  The project entails a more general investigation  into
              the role of incompressible surfaces as they relate to Heegaard  splittings.  In
              particular, it should provide information on (1) lower  bounds of the tunnel
              number of knots relative to their generalized prime  decompositions; (2) bounds
              on the degeneration of tunnel number under  connected sum of knots; (3) torus
              decompositions of manifolds; (4) the  Heegaard genus of Haken manifolds; and
              (5) stabilization problems.       The general philosophy of this project stems
              from a realization that  3-dimensional manifolds have been studied from several
              viewpoints.  Two of  these viewpoints involve cutting the 3-manifold along
              surfaces into basic  building blocks.  The idea of cutting along a surface to
              understand the  3-manifold in which the surface lies, is a natural extension of
              the idea  of cutting along circles to understand the surface in which the
              circles  lie.  In the case of surfaces, the analysis of the circles contained
              in  the surface suffices to characterize the surface.  A complete
              classification  has been obtained.  3-manifolds have proven to be far less
              tractable  objects.  In fact, extending the idea that has been so successful
              for the  analysis of surfaces has engendered two very different viewpoints in
              the  study of 3-manifolds.  The investigator endeavors to reconcile these two 
              viewpoints.  ***
