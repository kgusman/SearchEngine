Oertel
     Building on previous work, Ulrich Oertel will study the
              topology of
3-manifolds, using essential laminations and essential maps of
              surfaces.
The goals include generalizing results about Haken manifolds to
              manifolds
containing essential laminations or admitting essential maps of
              surfaces.
In addition, with Jacek Swiatkowski, Oertel will study contact
              structures,
confoliations, and contaminations in 3-manifolds.  This may also
              lead to
results about the topology of 3-manifolds admitting appropriately
              restricted
(essential or tight) versions of these (partial) plane fields on
              the
3-manifolds.   Another goal is to establish further connections
              between
contact structures and foliations and laminations in 3-manifolds. 
              Finally,
Oertel will continue to study automorphisms of 3-manifolds, refining
              and
generalizing existing work that deals with the important case
              of
automorphisms of handlebodies and compression bodies.  The goal
              here,
already partially achieved, is to classify automorphisms of
              3-manifolds
up to isotopy, as in the Nielsen-Thurston classification of
              automorphisms
of surfaces.
     A closed 3-manifold is a space that is
              locally like ordinary
3-dimensional space.  Thus, understanding 3-manifolds
              amounts to
understanding all possible 3-dimensional universes.  Especially
              since
humans live in a 3-dimensional space, one wishes to determine
              properties
of 3-manifolds, and ultimately, also to classify them.  From the
              1950's
to the 1970's, progress on 3-manifolds was based to a large degree
              on
methods using certain embedded surfaces, called incompressible
              surfaces.
From the 3-manifolds containing incompressible surfaces, one can,
              for
example, extract algebraic information sufficient to distinguish any
              two
of them.  The investigator will use objects in 3-manifolds similar
              to
incompressible surfaces, namely essential laminations and essential
              maps
of surfaces, to explore the unknown territory further.  There are
              other
structures on 3-manifolds, called contact structures, that have
              their
origins in geometry rather than topology.  Work of Eliashberg and
              Thurston
has shown that contact structures are related, via confoliations,
              to
certain laminations called foliations.  With Swiatkowski, the
              investigator
is finding further connections among an entire range of related
              objects:
contact structures, confoliations, foliations, laminations,
              and
contaminations, the last being a newly invented object.  It is typical
              in
mathematics to study a space by studying suitable maps from the space
              to
itself.  For 3-manifolds, one can consider maps called automorphisms
              or
self-diffeomorphisms.  In continuing research, Oertel is
              classifying
automorphisms of 3-manifolds (up to isotopy).  The work is
              revealing a
rich and interesting theory of the automorphisms of some of the
              simplest
3-manifolds.
