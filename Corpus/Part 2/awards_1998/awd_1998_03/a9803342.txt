     In this project the investigator will be studying
              conjectures of
Novikov and Borel, and proposing and working on a new
              conjecture
concerning the algebraic K-theory of fields.  In the
              Novikov-Borel
portion of the project, he will be attempting to replace
              geometric
conditions (which have allowed the proof of these conjectures in
              a
number of cases) by more algebraic and homotopy theoretic
              conditions
concerning the fundamental group.  The methods here include
              the
Pedersen-Weibel``bounded K-theory,'' and a  G-theoretic version
              that
studies non-free modules over the group rings in question.  If this
is
              sufficiently successful, it could lead to the solution of Borel's
conjecture
              that two closed manifolds whose universal cover is Euclidean
n-space are in
              fact homeomorphic.  In the algebraic K-theory of fields
portion, the
              investigator has developed a new version of the
Lichtenbaum-Quillen
              conjectures, which appears to have a chance of
identifying the K-theory of
              fields ``on the nose'' (rather than in
sufficiently high dimensions) and which
              depends directly on
the representation theory of the Galois group rather than
              on the group
itself.  One hopes that this will give new arithmetic
              applications of
K-theory.
     Work on this project will be directed toward
              two important
problems.  The first revolves around the study of manifolds,
              spaces
(such as spheres, tori, etc.) in which every point has a
              neighborhood
that resembles ordinary Euclidean space.  One notion of
              equivalence
for such manifolds is homotopy equivalence, a relatively
              weak
condition.  For instance, a circle and an annulus are
              homotopy
equivalent, since one direction of the annulus can be compressed
              to
obtain a circle.  The other notion is homeomorphism, which is a
              very
strong condition, requiring that there be an explicit way to
              identify
the points of one manifold with those of the other so that each
              point
of one corresponds to exactly one in the other.  The latter
              is
typically very hard to verify, while homotopy equivalence is
relatively
              easy to verify.  The conjecture of Borel asserts that for a
large class of
              manifolds (those whose universal cover is ordinary
Euclidean space) homotopy
              equivalence implies homeomorphism.  The
investigator is approaching this
              conjecture via algebraic methods,
involving algebraic invariants of the
              manifolds in question.  The
second problem studies the so-called ``algebraic
              K-theory'' of fields
(algebraic objects in which one has addition,
              multiplication, and
division, like the rational or the real numbers).  It
              proposes a new
conjecture for a description of this K-theory, one which is
              stronger
than the earlier Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures.  In this project,
              the
investigator will be developing methods for verifying his conjecture
in
              many cases.  The hope is that studying this conjecture will give
new
              applications to arithmetic for this topological invariant.
