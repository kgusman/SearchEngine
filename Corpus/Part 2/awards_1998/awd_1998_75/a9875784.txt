Abstract    :
              Stream-subsurface interactions have been demonstrated to control the downstream
              transport of various contaminants, such as metals, radionuclides and arsenic,
              as well as the release of these substances from contaminated sediments.  The
              purpose of the proposed research is to develop fundamental physical and
              chemical understanding of the basic processes controlling the exchange of
              contaminants and other substances between flowing streams and their underlying
              sediments and to integrate this understanding into a unified set of models that
              will describe net exchange in natural streams based on easily-measurable
              physical and chemical parameters.  Flume experiments will be used to study
              exchange processes under carefully controlled conditions.  Field experiments
              will be used to study large-scale exchange processes and to observe the effect
              of multiple  exchange processes operating simultaneously.  Fundamental
              descriptions of individual exchange  processes will be developed and these
              process descriptions will be integrated into a unified set of models for net
              exchange.  The exchange of both conservative solutes and select
              non-conservative substances will be considered.  The educational plan will
              prepare future researchers and practicing engineers to work on
              interdisciplinary environmental problems.  It consists of components targeting
              graduate education, undergraduate education and underprivileged high school
              students.  A fourth component will be the development of an
              engineering-oriented M.S. program in International Development.
