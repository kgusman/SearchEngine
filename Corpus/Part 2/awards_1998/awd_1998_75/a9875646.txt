This proposal is focused on the use of polymer dispersed
              liquid crystals (PDLCs) for display devices.  Polymer dispersed liquid crystals
              consist of micron size drops of small molecule (nematic) liquid crystals
              embedded or trapped in a polymer matrix formed by photopolymerization.  The aim
              of the proposal is to understand the dynamics of domain growth in a reactive
              medium that is undergoing phase separation.  A laser scanning confocal
              microscope (LSCM) will be utilized to make measurements confirming growth laws
              operable in these systems, and to develop methods of imaging director
              configurations in complicated morphologies in three dimension.  Such methods
              should find applications in a variety of other areas besides the materials
              under study in this proposal.  The integration of this research with education
              goals will provide a very stimulating environment for students both at the
              undergraduate and graduate levels.  The integration of research and education
              to be implemented in this project will provide students with a very broad
              education that crosses disciplinary boundaries, requiring knowledge of physics
              of liquid crystals, chemistry, optics, and polymer chemistry.

              thin films are utilized in various technological applications.  Their role in
              display devices is a case in point.  The use of devices for displaying
              information that use liquid crystals are quite pervasive as is evidenced by
              their use in laptop computer screens.  This particular approach to the
              integration of research with education will expose both undergraduate and
              graduate students to interdisciplinary research that provides a glimpse of what
              is to follow in industrial settings.  The biggest impact will be in educating
              young minds and preparing young scientists and engineers to compete in future
              job markets.  These outreach activities are also designed to help educate high
              school teachers on issues that are pertinent to society in this "age of
              plastics".
