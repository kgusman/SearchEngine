Experimental Software Systems:  A Parallel Message-Passing
              Platform for Atomic Structure Calculations

This project is an experimental
              and analytic investigation of a previously untested type of network interface
              as the interconnect of a cluster of workstations for the calculation of atomic
              structure data.  As an example, recent calculations for the prediction of the
              electron affinity of boron yielded an answer that spurred new experimental
              measurements of a boron atom.  However, such accuracy for larger atoms may
              present a considerable computational challenge.  The hardware platform being
              studied is a cluster of workstations interconnected with a network interface
              that contains user-level accessible memory.  Each node has memory in the
              network interface that can be used to cache shared data, and that may be read
              or written by any node.  

Primary efforts are to (1) propose modifications
              to the atomic structure calculation that use network interface memory as a
              respository for selected shared data, (2) evaluate via analysis and
              experimentation the effectiveness of using shared buffers and zero-copy
              messaging for atomic structure calculations, and evaluate tradeoffs such as
              memory partitioning techniques and data and thread placement, and (3) propose
              generalizations of these experimental results for use in other scientific
              code.

It is expected that investigations will lead to a new proposal for an
              implementation of large atomic structure calculations with better
              performance.
