Abstract    :
              9806046  Neugebauer   This project pioneers a cytological assay that
              simultaneously localizes particular genes by in situ hybridization and
              alternative splicing factors by immunocytochemistry.  The Principle
              Investigator has completed a preliminary study, using high resolution
              fluorescent light microscopy to co-localize splicing factors with active sites
              of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II (Neugebauer and Roth, 1997.  Genes
              Dev 11:1148-1159).  These results and others argue strongly that pre-mRNA is
              spliced while it is being synthesized at the gene.  In addition, she found that
              a particular alternative splicing factor, SRp20, was located at a subset of the
              sites where general splicing factors were located, suggesting the gene-specific
              action of individual splicing factors.  Thus, the interphase nucleus of any
              cell can be studied cytologically to determine which genes are being expressed
              and which regulators are associated with those active genes.  The long term
              goal is to establish a number of experimental systems to examine regulated gene
              expression.  During the one-year period covered by the POWRE award, Dr.
              Neugebauer plans to use the high resolution light microscopy system
              Deltavision, which has been under development at Fred Hutchinson Cancer
              Research Center by Applied Precision, Inc.  This technology is only available
              at a very few labs and institutions world-wide.  Therefore, the POWRE award is
              being used to support research/educational enhancement.   This research project
              addresses how the cell nucleus carries out its functions.  In the cytoplasm,
              the cell achieves a high degree of order and efficiency by compartmentalizing
              its functions among the organelles.  This work uses precursor messenger RNA
              (pre-mRNA) maturation as an example with which to probe nuclear structure and
              function.  Sophisticated labeling techniques using antisera and nucleic acids
              will be developed to determine whether mRNA maturation occurs in specific
              subdomains of the nucleus and to study its regulation.
