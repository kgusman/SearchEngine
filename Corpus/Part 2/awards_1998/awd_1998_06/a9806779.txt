Abstract    :
              DEB 9806779  DeVries     Resolving the higher level phylogeny of the diverse
              family  Nymphalidae is one of the most controversial problems in butterfly 
              systematics.  Independent of the type of data used (morphological or DNA 
              sequence) previous studies on the Nymphalidae have produced conflicting or 
              poorly resolved trees, possibly the result of inadequate taxon sampling.  Our
              work seeks to overcome this limitation through examining a large number  of
              species within four closely related nymphalid subfamilies, and using a 
              combination of early stage and adult characters.  By employing these two 
              protocols our study will be set apart from all previous systematic research  on
              this group.          A complementary objective of our higher level study
              involves a  phylogenetic study of the neotropical genus Morpho, obvious
              components of  all neotropical forests and well known to entomologists and the
              general  public.  Nevertheless, our ecological and evolutionary understanding
              of  these butterflies has been impeded by the lack of a well resolved 
              phylogeny, something that our work seeks to rectify.          To construct
              phylogenies for nymphalid subfamilies and the genus  Morpho, parsimony methods
              will be used to analyze data for early stages and  adults.  By including
              different hierarchical levels in our analyses  (species to subfamily), it will
              be possible to assess variation within each  character, and therefore our study
              will constitute the most complete  evaluation of character divergence ever
              performed for these nymphalid  subfamilies.  Preliminary results show the
              feasibility of our proposed  higher level and species level studies, and our
              results will make a  significant contribution toward understanding one of the
              best known  butterfly families.
