Ravenel
     Professor Ravenel's current research is focused on the
              telescope
conjecture of stable homotopy theory, one of several conjectures
              he
formulated 20 years ago, and the only one that is not well understood
              at
this time.  Other conjectures he made then have since evolved into
              the
nilpotence theorem of Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith, the periodicity theorem
              of
Hopkins-Smith, and the the thick subcategory theorem.  All of these
              are
part of the chromatic approach to homotopy theory, which continues
              to
attract the interest of numerous algebraic topologists. 
              More
specifically, Ravenel has constructed and will study the
              Thomified
Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence, which includes the
              usual
Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence, the Adams spectral sequence, and
              the
Adams-Novikov spectral sequence as special cases.  He also has a
              program
for the computation of the Morava K-theory of interated loop spaces
              of
spheres. 
     Stable homotopy theory is a branch of algebraic topology,
              which has
been central to pure mathematics since its founding by Poincare a
              century
ago.  It has been a continuing source of new ideas in algebra and
              geometry,
as seen in the work of Lefschetz on complex algebraic varieties in
              the
1930's, the efforts leading to the proof of the Weil conjectures
              of
arithmetic algebraic geometry in the 1960's and 1970's, and most
              recently,
in the successful application of motivic cohomology to the
              Milnor
conjecture in algebraic K-theory by Voevodsky in 1997.  It has also
              found
numerous applications in differential geometry, in graph theory, and
              in
theoretical physics.  The University of Rochester is one of the
              leading
centers of algebraic topology in the world.
