Abstract    :
              9802558  Wu       It is a common practice to use lower dimensional objects as
              tools  for studying manifolds.  For example, a manifold containing some 
              embedded essential surfaces, but no essential spheres, is called a  Haken
              manifold.  The geometric structure of Haken manifolds is well  understood, but
              unfortunately many manifolds are not Haken.  One is  thus forced to consider
              other lower dimensional objects in studying them,  such as laminations and
              immersed surfaces.  The objective of this project  is to understand the role of
              immersed essential surfaces in 3-manifolds,  particularly the issue of whether
              such surfaces will lift to embedded  surfaces in a finite covering.  This would
              be an important step toward  a clear understanding of the topological and
              geometric structure of  3-manifolds.       Manifolds appear naturally in
              physics and other sciences, since a  manifold is an object for which each point
              is surrounded by a small  neighborhood the same as one in the solid ball in a
              Euclidean space.  If the Euclidean space in question is of dimension three, we
              call such  a manifold a 3-manifold.  This being the dimension in which we live,
               it is not surprising that 3-manifolds have attracted a great deal of 
              attention in mathematics and physics.  What is perhaps more surprising  is the
              extent to which 3-manifolds have shown themselves resistant to   analysis,
              generally more so than manifolds of dimensions above five,  where our
              3-dimensional intuitions flounder but other tools come to the  rescue.  Most of
              these tools are not available in dimension three, and  that is what is at issue
              here, finding alternatives that do work in the  critical dimension three.  ***
