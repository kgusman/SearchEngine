Abstract    :
              9457359  Horne  Columbia University    New synthetic methodologies and
              strategies will be developed uner this NSF Young Investigator Award for the
              construction of structurally complex guanidine-based marine natural products
              possessing important biological activities. The research will focus on the
              chemistry of 2-aminoimidazoles, where key targets are saxitoxin and related
              gonyautoxin alkaloids. A recently discovered  2 + 4 -cycloaddition reaction of
              2-aminoimidazoles will be employed to generate tetrahydropurines, which will
              allow a short synthetic route to saxitoxin and gonyautoxins.    This grant from
              the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Professor David A. Horne
              at Columbia University. Marine naturally occurring compounds that contain basic
              nitrogen atoms (alkaloids) will be synthesized. Some of the alkaloids to be
              synthesized are neurotoxins which are found in red-tides. In the course of this
              research it is anticipated that new synthetic methods will be developed as well
              as shorter routes to the naturally occurring alkaloids. Related compounds that
              will be synthesized have potentially interesting medicinal properties.
