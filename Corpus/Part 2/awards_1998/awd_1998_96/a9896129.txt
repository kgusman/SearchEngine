Abstract    :
              9725928  Moschkovich    This project will examine the nature and development of
              mathematical discourse in bilingual settings.  The premise of this research is
              that the design of teaching environments for this population of students would
              be facilitated by developing a deeper understanding of classroom mathematical
              discourse in general, descriptions of how learning mathematics in two languages
              involves acquiring more than a technical vocabulary, and a consideration of the
              resources bilingual students bring to the mathematics classroom.  The main
              research questions to be examined are 1) how bilingual students negotiate the
              meaning of mathematical descriptions, explanations, and arguments and what
              resources they use in constructing these; and 2) whether and how students'
              mathematical discourse and conceptions change as a results of participation in
              conversations with their peers or a teacher.  Observational, videotape, and
              interview data will be collected in secondary classrooms reflecting "best
              instructional practices" related to success with bilingual Latino students.  
              The project will focus on two types of data: classroom conversations (among
              students or between teachers and students) and non-classroom discussion among
              students arranged to occur after school.  Based on the results of this
              research, the project will provide 1) a descriptive and theoretical account of
              classroom mathematical discourse in bilingual settings, 2) a collection of
              illustrative resources that can support bilingual students' learning, 3) a set
              of principled teaching strategies for supporting the refinement of students'
              mathematical discourse, and 4) a pilot set of video cases of mathematical
              discourse in bilingual settings for use in preservice and inservice teacher
              education.
