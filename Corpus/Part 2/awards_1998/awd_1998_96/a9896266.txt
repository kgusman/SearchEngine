Abstract    :
                 Certain fish are known as "weakly electric fish" because they have electric
              organs that generate a small repetitive discharge that creates an electric
              field in the surrounding water.  The fish has electrosensory receptors in the
              skin which are able to detect the timing and the spatial distribution of the
              electrical field, and can use this information for sensing objects in the
              environment, and for communication.  The first stage of central processing of
              the electrosensory information is a part of the brain called the electrosensory
              lateral-line lobe (ELL); this lobe has a cortical structure with a cellular
              organization similar to that found in the cerebellum.  Other systems also
              project to the ELL, including sensory input from other systems such as
              mechanoreceptors of the lateral-line organ, signals descending from higher
              levels of the electrosensory system, and a particular set of signals called
              "corollary discharge" which occurs every time the electric orgal discharge
              occurs, and is believed to provide a reference signal useful to interpreting
              how the electrosensory input from the environment may be changed from the
              "expected" input.  This project uses electrophysiological cellular recording
              and anatomical methods to complete a study of the cell types found in the ELL;
              to establish the major cell classes of the next higher central station called
              the pre-eminential nucleus, and how they project to the ELL; and to see whether
              the non-electrosensory inputs to the ELL can change depending on prior
              association with electrosensory input.     Results from this work will be
              important for insights into the possible functions of central inputs that
              modulate incoming sensory signals, and in clarifying fundamental principles of
              functional circuitry in structures like the cerebellum.
