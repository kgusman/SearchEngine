Abstract    :
              9622298  Li  The Department of Electrical Engineering at Rochester Institute of
              Technology will purchase a  phase and amplitude measurement systems which will
              be dedicated to support research in engineering.  The equipment will be used
              for several research projects, including in particular:   1. "A Novel FM
              Microwave Fiber-Optic Link for Antenna Remoting and    Phased Arrays'   2. "An
              Ultra Wideband Microwave Fiber-Optic Transmitter Based on Laser    Diodes with
              Short External Cavity"   3. "All-Optical SCM and WDM-SCM Multi-Access Networks"
               These research projects share a key innovation in generating
              microwave/millimeter-wave subcarriers on an optical carrier exploiting
              "instabilities" of nonlinear optical systems.  Specifically, the
              microwave/millimeter-wave subcarriers are generated all optically using the
              optical current controlled oscillator (CCO) which systematically exploits
              inherent nonlinear dynamics, mainly the formation of  periodic orbits.    The
              phase and amplitude noise of the subcarrier determines, to a large extent, the
              signal-to-noise ratio (bit-error rate) of the analog (digital) links or
              communication networks.  The equipment requested will be used in combination
              with theoretical investigations to determine the dependence of the amplitude
              and phase noise as functions of device parameters and operating conditions. 
              Subsequently strategies for reducing these noises will be formulated. 
              Ultimately, low-noise optical CCO's will be inserted in microwave fiber-optic
              links as well as SCM and WDM-SCM multi-access fiber-optic networks.  ***
