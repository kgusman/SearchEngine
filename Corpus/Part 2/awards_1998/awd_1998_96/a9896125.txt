Abstract    :
              9725454  Sinton  High MgO lavas (komatiites and picrites) are a rare but
              important component of the mid-Cretaceous Caribbean plateau large igneous
              province (LIP). These lava types are critical to understanding mantle
              temperature and dynamics that lead to their production but are inaccessible in
              other oceanic LIP provinces. This project is an integrated field, petrological
              and geochemical study of the recently discovered Tortugal ultramafic/mafic
              lavas of Costa Rica. Major element, trace element, platinum group element and
              Sr-Nd-Pb-Os isotope analyses, combined with 40Ar-39Ar dating, will be used to
              characterize the Tortugal lavas in order to further document the spatial and
              temporal variability in petrogenesis related to LIP formation in the region.
              The Tortugal suite is temporally related to the Gorgona Island komatiites,
              picrites and basalts 1000 km to the southeast, however preliminary data show
              significant differences in mantle source and thermal regime between the two
              areas. Understanding the spatial variability in high MgO lavas will help
              distinguish between rapid decompression melting or plume head models for the
              creation of the Caribbean plateau.
