Abstract    :
              9704025  Naughton    A highly sensitive cantilever magnetometer will be
              developed for  use in pulsed magnetic fields.  It is anticipated that this 
              device will achieve a sensitivity of order 10-12 Am2 (10-9 emu)  in fields up
              to 100T, thus exceeding the sensitivity of  conventional detection methods by 2
              to 3 orders of magnitude.       The motivation for this project is the
              thermodynamic study  of physical phenomena in the highest available magnetic
              fields,  which are now obtained only in transient, pulsed fields of 10-2  to 1
              second duration.  At the present time, experiments in pulsed  fields are
              restricted to studies of magnetotransport, magneto-  optics, and magnetic
              susceptibility.  For the latter, an  inductive method is usually employed,
              wherein a voltage  proportional to the derivative of the magnetic moment with 
              respect to magnetic field is induced in a multi-turn coil.  If  one integrates
              this susceptibility signal AC=dm/dH, one obtains  information about the
              magnetic moment m, with typical sensitivity  to moment of 10-8 to 10-9 Am2, or
              10-5 to 10-6 emu.  With the  successful development of a cantilever
              magnetometer for the  pulsed field regime, a very significant improvement over
              this  inductance method can be realized.  %%%       In this project, we will
              design, fabricate and test a  variety of cantilever devices configured
              especially for use in  long (~10-1 s) and short (~10-2 s) pulse magnetic
              fields.  A low  field pulse system will be assembled for local temporal 
              characterization of the new devices, with full characterization  taking place
              at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory's  Pulsed Field Facility at Los
              Alamos National Laboratory.  If this  projects succeeds, it will significantly
              enhance the measurement  capabilities of a large and growing number of
              investigators  working with pulsed magnetic fields, by making sensitive 
              magnetometry an accessible technique to a variety of physical  systems in
              fields approaching 100T.  Upon successful completion  of the project, t he new
              devices will be made available to users  at the NHMFL @ LANL.  It therefore has
              the potential to benefit  many researchers in the condensed matter sciences. 
              In addition,  there is significant potential for the transfer of this 
              technology to industry.  ***
