Abstract

This research will focus on developing a better
              understanding of the seismic response of hybrid wall systems through detailed
              inelastic dynamic analyses.  Two types of hybrid wall systems will be
              considered, a) structural systems comprised of solid or perforated reinforced
              concrete shear walls and steel moment frames, and b) structural systems
              comprised of steel-girder-coupled shear walls and steel moment frames.  The
              investigation includes three interrelated components.  The first component will
              focus on development of and existing finite element program to include wall
              finite elements capable of simulating the complex behavior of wall panels.  The
              second part involves the design of a number of prototype hybrid wall systems
              using currently existing provisions.  The third component involves conducting a
              large number of inelastic dynamic analyses using the developed analytical
              tools.  The analyses will concentrate on  1) identifying the optimal degree of
              coupling between coupled shear walls, 2) shedding more light on the interaction
              between shear walls and moment frames, 3) establishing design oriented methods
              for determining the distribution of forces in the walls and frames, 3)
              establishing design oriented methods for determining the distribution of forces
              in the walls and frames, and 4) assessing currently recommended provisions for
              the design of hybrid wall systems and their components.

One of the most
              important products of this project will be the determination of performance
              measures for different levels of earthquake loading and for different limit
              states of structural behavior.  This data will be invaluable for the future
              development of performance based designed criteria for hybrid wall
              systems.

This project is supported under the 4th year competition of
              initiative NSF 94-154.
