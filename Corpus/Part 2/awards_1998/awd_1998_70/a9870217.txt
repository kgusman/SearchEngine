Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the analysis of the time evolution   of random
              surfaces.  Special emphasis will be placed on the computer   algorithms needed
              to implement simulations of the   mathematical models. The understanding of the
              motion of  interfaces and boundary surfaces is of great importance for many
              industrial   processes (image analysis, crystal growth, thin films, crack 
              nucleation, etc.) The motivation for this research came originally from the  
              denoising and enhancement of still images and videos.  For this reason,   the
              efforts will concentrate on the two and three dimensional cases.  Very little
              attention has been given so far to stochastic versions   of such problems, even
              though they are believed to offer a more   realistic alternative that
              deterministic approaches.     Many problems in science and engineering involve
              moving boundaries and  surfaces.  Examples range from melting and
              solidification to the automatic  detection of edges in videos.  The
              mathematical methods that have been developed  for these purposes so far
              usually do not take randomness into account.   This research will begin to
              incorporate such effects, focussing on applications   that are related to the
              denoising and enhancement of images and videos.
