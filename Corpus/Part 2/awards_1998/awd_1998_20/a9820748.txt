This award provides partial support for the (first) Santa Barbara
Summer
              Conference in Geometry, to be held from July 21 to July
24, 1999 on the campus
              of University of California, Santa
Barbara. The purposes of this conference
              are threefold. First, to
bring together the leading experts in geometry, and
              especially in
the fields closely related to physics. Second, to survey
              the
recent remarkable progress spurred by physics, especially string
theory,
              and point to new directions and frontiers for young
researchers, graduate
              students and postdocs. Third, to further
stimulate the fruitful interactions
              between mathematics and
physics in coordination with the program "Geometry and
              Duality"
to be run right after this conference at the Institute
              for
Theoretical Physics, UCSB.

Currently, we are witnessing the blossoming
              of a golden age of
interactions between physics (in particular high energy
              physics)
and mathematics (in particular, differential geometry,
differential
              topology and algebraic geometry). On the one hand,
physicists, guided by
              physical intuitions and equipped with most
advanced mathematical tools, bring
              about new break-throughs which
pose new challenging problems and also provide
              new insights for
mathematics. On the other hand, mathematicians, inspired
              and
spurred by advances in physics, make amazing progresses in
mathematics,
              which in turn provide new machineries for
physicists.  Mathematicians also
              make direct contributions to
physics in collaboration with physicists. The
              joint efforts of
physicists and mathematicians lead to major advances in
              our
understanding of the structures of the universe, and will
ultimately
              uncover major new energy sources and provide new
foundations for more powerful
              natural computations at higher and
deeper levels.  The Santa Barbara Summer
              Conference in Geometry
is designed to make contributions in the framework of
              these
developments.
