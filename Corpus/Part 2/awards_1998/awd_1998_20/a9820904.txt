Gilkey will study time dependent processes which are controlled
by
              the heat equation and the short time asymptotics which arise
thereby. The
              first project involves the heat content asymptotics,
moving from the static
              setting to the setting where the data
(metric, internal heat sources, boundary
              conditions) are time
dependent. Previous work always assumed smooth
              boundary
conditions; in this project the boundary conditions
              are
discontinuous. The second project involves studying the
asymptotics of
              the short time expansion of the fundamental
solution of the heat equation. 
              Most previous studies have
involved static geometries, but it is natural to
              study these
asymptotic expansions for time dependent geometries for
              quite
general operators of Laplace type and for quite general
homogeneous
              boundary conditions. This investigation will involve
expanding the usual
              calculus of pseudo differential operators to
establish the existence of the
              required short time asymptotics as
well as determining how the time dependent
              variation of the
metric and the coupling constants for Neumann boundary
              conditions
influences the short time asymptotics of the heat kernel.

There
              are many physical settings where boundary conditions are
discontinuous. For
              example, a body floating in ice water
satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions
              on the part immersed in
the water and Neumann boundary conditions on the
              remainder
(assuming as a first approximation that there is no heat
              transfer
from the air to the body); the boundary conditions are
discontinuous
              along the water/air interface. Understanding
additional boundary contributions
              coming from the water/air
interface are likely to be of great physical
              importance, and
links the differential geometry of the situation to the
              physical
underpinnings of the subject. There are also many conditions
where
              the geometry is not static; the Universe is expanding to
cite one example.
              Boundary conditions in physical settings may
vary with time; for example, the
              temperature outside a building
varies with the time of day as well as with the
              season;
consequently the associated heat flow is not well modeled by a
static
              setting. Understanding the heat flow in this setting has
obvious physical
              applications.  The heat equation asymptotics and
heat content asymptotics have
              proven to be of central importance
in theoretical physics.  For example, these
              asymptotics play an
important role in the renormalization of field theory in
              curved
space and also in string and membrane theory, and they are
related to
              zeta function renormalization.
