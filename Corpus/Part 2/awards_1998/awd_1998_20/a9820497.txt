Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research project of Arthur Delcher at Loyola College at
              Maryland (RUI award IIS-9820497) and Steven Salzberg at the Institute for
              Genomic Research (award IIS-9902923). The quantity of DNA sequence data is
              exploding, and with this growth comes a parallel growth in the demand for
              computational methods for sequence analysis. This abundance of data demands new
              and highly accurate computational analysis tools to explore these sequences and
              maximize the scientific knowledge gained from them. This interdisciplinary
              project combines the latest techniques in data modeling and data mining with
              knowledge of molecular biology to find genes and other scientifically
              significant patterns in DNA sequence databases.  The Glimmer system uses
              Interpolated Markov Models (IMMs) to finding genes in microbial genomes. This
              tremendously successful system has found over 98% of the genes in the bacteria
              that cause Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, and others. This project is
              developing new systems to find genes in the much more complex DNA of higher
              organisms, and at the same time advancing the state of the art for the
              underlying IMM technology. Specific foci of the project include: developing
              improved probabilistic models for gene finding; developing algorithmic methods
              for identifying laterally transferred genes and other unusual DNA sequences;
              and developing IMMs and other probabilistic techniques for analyzing DNA in
              higher organisms including plants and mammals.  This project will dramatically
              improve our ability to discover genes and other biologically significant
              features in a wide range of organisms, leading to the development of new
              antibiotics and vaccines and to a better understanding of how DNA directs the
              functions of a living cell. The software will be freely disseminated in the
              genomics community.
