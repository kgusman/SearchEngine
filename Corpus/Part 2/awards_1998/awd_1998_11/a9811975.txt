Abstract    :
                        To quantify the exchange of fluids and dissolved  constituents from
              the Cascadia margin hydrate field to the  overlying water column a
              multi-investigator program is  designed to measure this exchange under a
              variety of  conditions within the Cascadia region.  A 2-year field  program
              will deploy benthic devices that sample fluid  discharge.  Gravity, push and
              multicores will be used to  assess how near-surface formation and decomposition
              of a  mixed CH4-H2S hydrate in continental margin sediments  influences benthic
              fluxes and early diagenetic reactions.  The data collected during the first
              year will be used to  assess the spatial variations of constituent release from
               the hydrate field, variations that are likely to be most  significant at
              active venting sites.  These results will 1)  identify ideal sites for temporal
              variability studies to be  conducted during two subsequent visits to the area,
              and 2)  define the length and number of deployments in the following  field
              programs.         The different environments present in the Cascadia  margin,
              along with the spatial-temporal experimental design  will enable assessment of
              the effect of widespread hydrate  formation in the Cascadia margin on element
              mobilization,  transport, and release at the seafloor.  This knowledge has 
              applications for broader issues on a global scale, as  hydrate geochemistry is
              of significant relevance in global  carbon budgets, climate change models,
              sediment slope  stability, and energy resource issues.
