OCE-9819324 / OCE-9902660 / OCE- 9902658


Although a number of
              recent studies have verified that primary production in various marine
              environments may be limited by trace metal availability, there has not yet been
              a similar body of research for freshwater systems, even the inland sea system
              of the North American Great Lakes.  In this project researchers from the
              University of Minnesota, Rutgers University, and Bowling Green State University
              will investigate the existence, mechanisms, spatial-temporal extent, and
              significance of trace metal limitation to primary production in Lake Superior. 
              They will take a three-pronged approach.  First, to quantify and characterize
              total and bioactive trace metal concentrations, Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Co
              would be determined in solution, in suspended particles, and in plankton in the
              field.  Secondly, immunological and fluorescence assays would be used to assess
              metal deficiency in algae in the field.  Third,  trace metal enrichment
              experiments would be used to assess limitation experimentally in the
              laboratory.  The three field sites would be chosen to take advantage of
              existing data available from the NSF-sponsored KITES program.
