              DMS 9801130  Project: Sixth Purdue International Symposium on Statistics   
              Abstract:     This international symposium will be held from June 17 to 21,
              1998,  at Purdue University.  The symposium consists of a workshop June 17-19 
              on "Synthesis and Interfaces of Major Statistical Paradigms" and a   conference
              June 19-21 on "Statistical Decision Theory and Related Topics".  The workshop
              will focus on the major approaches such as frequentist,   Bayesian, likelihood,
              and bootstrap paradigms.  The different paradigms  are not simply separate
              approaches that should be developed individually,   but are instead pieces of
              the puzzle of statistical inference that must  be fit together.  One of the
              primary purposes of the conference on decision  theory is to use the unifying
              nature of decision theory to enhance   cross-fertilization among apparently
              disparate areas of statistics.  The  conference is a natural adjunct to the
              workshop.    Statistical decision theory is increasingly used in modeling and
              analysis  of decision problems in business, economics, medicine, law,
              reliability  and quality control, risk assessment, and numerous other fields. 
              It   attempts to provide a formal approach to decision making and statistical  
              inference by asking that explicit numerical criteria be given and that  the
              merits of a statisitcal procedure or decision be assessed by these   criteria. 
              The broad topics for the conference include classical subjects  within or
              related to statistical inference and decision theory.  The   interface workshop
              examines areas where the different paradigms used by  statisticians may be
              unified in methodology.  The focus is on model  selection and testing,
              confidence sets and prediction intervals,   nonparametrics and statistical
              computation.    A large portion of the grant will go towards expenses of  
              graduate students, new researchers, and members of underrepresented  groups.
