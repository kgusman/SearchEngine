              Simultaneous with the explosion in computer speed and ability,
>the biological
              sciences have been undergoing a revolution.  There has 
>also been an
              explosive increase in the quantitative understanding of the 
>fundamental
              building blocks of life.  The emergence of molecular biology 
>has defined
              biology with mathematical precision through the genetic 
>code. We now have
              the tools to study and manipulate biology at the level
>of individual
              molecules.  This has resulted in an explosion of data.  This 
>project
              examines how one class of molecules, ion channels generates, 
>controls and
              coordinates normal and abnormal electrical activity in the 
>heart.  Recently
              developed techniques in molecular biology can tell us the 
>tissue
              distribution of an ion channel type over the entire heart, down to
              
>microscopic resolution.  Previous techniques could only provide
              
>resolution down to a few millimeters and the currents from only a few
              
>cells could be measured within this space.  Thus, molecular biology has
              
>provided us with a several orders of magnitude increase in information
              
>concerning the density, cellular and tissue distribution of the excitable
              
>elements in the heart.  This is a several orders of magnitude increase in
              
>information over that available only a couple of years ago.  It is a major
              
>computational challenge to organize, display, interpret and utilize this
              
>new information.  This project will develop the computational tools to
              
>analyze this molecular information from a systems point of view.  This
              
>proposal seeks to develop the mathematical and computational tools to
              
>integrate this emerging data from molecular to organ function in cardiac
              
>muscle.  It will develop efficient methods to look at how patterns of
              
>electrical activity in individual cells are coordinated across the entire
              
>heart and how slow molecular processes, i.e. memory, influence events
              
>which occur on millisecond time scales during regular beating of the
              
>heart.
> Ion channels are found in all living cells.  Coordinated ionic
              
>responses arising from multicellular interactions are an integral part of
              
>the physiology of many organs.  Chaotic behavior and abnormal electrical
              
>activity is not only a problem in the heart where it may underlie fatal
              
>arrhythmias, but also plays a role in neurological disorders such
              as
>seizures. Action potentials and electrically coordinated activation of ion
              
>channels occurs across  a wide variety of species.  Similar mechanisms
              
>govern the leaf closing touch response of the Mimosa, heliotropism and
              
>solute transport in root systems.  Thus, the mathematical formulation of
              
>coordinated ion channel activity in heterogeneous systems is of wide
              
>application across biology.
