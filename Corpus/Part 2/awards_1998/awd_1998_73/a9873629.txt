Abstract    :
              This project is a study of how the antarctic sea ice cover responds to stresses
              applied by wind and ocean waves, and how the temperature distribution within
              the sea ice affects these responses.  Experiments will be conducted on the
              deformation and fracture of sea ice occurring in McMurdo Sound by applying a
              series of controlled stresses and observing their effects.  It is known that
              large ice floes do not fracture in the same way as small ones do, therefore it
              is necessary to carry out experiments on the scale of tens of meters in order
              to validly extrapolate the fracture process to the larger scales that have
              applications to engineering problems of breaking ice.  The crucial elements for
              this study are the obtaining of detailed information on the microstructure of
              the ice, such as crystal structure, brine channels, and other flaws in the ice
              fabric, and having a sound theoretical framework to guide the experimental work
              and subsequent model development.  A key effect is the initiation and growth of
              microcracks within the ice.  One component of the work will be carried out
              jointly with the New Zealand Antarctic program.  This concerns the fracture
              mechanics of fatigue crack propagation, the utilization of microstructural
              observations to verify magnetic resonance measurements of the structure of
              inclusions in the ice, and the acoustic emissions of fracture zones.
