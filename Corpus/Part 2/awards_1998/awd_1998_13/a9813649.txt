Origins of Cod on Georges Bank:  Contribution of Early Developmental Stages
              from the Scotian Shelf


Recent work in the Georges Bank-Gulf of Maine area
              has documented significant, and apparently episodic, fluxes of Scotian Shelf
              Water (SSW) from the Nova Scotian continental shelf to Georges Bank.  SSW is a
              relatively cold and fresh water mass with a significant component from the St.
              Lawrence River, and is commonly identifiable with T-S analyses of hydrographic
              data and in satellite images of sea surface temperature.  One such flux episode
              was observed March 1997 in satellite imagery and from shipboard hydrographic
              sampling on Georges Bank.  Qualitative at-sea analyses of ichthyoplankton
              sampled on the March cruise revealed a remarkably tight association between
              abundances of gadid eggs and the distribution of SSW suggesting, along with
              other lines of evidence, that most of those eggs were spawned on the Scotian
              Shelf and were advected with the SSW water mass to Georges Bank.  The
              fundamental question thus arises: to what extent are cod on Georges Bank
              imported to the Bank as early development stages by advection from Canadian
              waters to the east?  The goal of this research is to answer this question.  The
               approach will be two tiered: (1) performing retrospective elemental analyses
              of otoliths from archived larval cod samples, as well as of ichthyoplankton
              samples to be collected in 1998 and 1999 as part of the continuing Georges Bank
              GLOBEC project, analyzing them for Sr/Ca ratios, using an X-ray electron
              microprobe, and elemental "fingerprints", using UV lazer ablation inductively
              coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS); and (2) assessing the genetic
              identity of the larvae relative to larval and adult populations from Georges
              Bank and from the Scotian Shelf using nuclear DNA microsatellite techniques.
