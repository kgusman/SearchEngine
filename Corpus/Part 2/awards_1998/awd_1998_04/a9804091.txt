Abstract    :
              9804091  This project focuses on the development of effective  specification
              formalisms for component-oriented, or open,  concurrent systems. The specific
              topics addressed include: the  investigation of implicit specifications for
              open systems; and  the development of efficient yet generic model-checking 
              techniques for temporal logics, including those for open systems.  Implicit
              specifications take form of contexts, or system  descriptions with "holes,"
              into which the component being  developed is to be inserted. The motivation for
              such  specifications is practical: they may be written using the same  notation
              in which the system description is given and do not  require users to learn
              additional logical notations. This project  investigates the expressiveness of,
              and case studies involving,  such specifications. Model checkers permit the 
              automatic determination of when systems enjoy properties in  temporal logics.
              The results of this part of the project will  show how generic yet efficient
              model-checking procedures that  work for all temporal logics may be given; this
              will improve on  the existing state of the art, which requires new procedures 
              for each new logic. The project as a whole will yield results  leading to
              improved automated methodologies, and hence better  analysis tools, for
              specifying and reasoning about component-  oriented concurrent software.***
