              Abstract  ATM-9810254  Overpeck, Jonathan T.  University of Colorado  Title:
              Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana: High-resolution Paleoclimatology and  Seismic Reflection
              Site Survey    Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, is an important and unique resource for 
              paleoenvironmental research.  The value of the Lake Bosumtwi  sediments has
              been demonstrated for reconstructing centennial to  millennial-scale variations
              of the West African monsoon.   Lamination counts and radiometric data prove
              that the last 1000  years of the Bosumtwi sediment record is annually-laminated
               (varved), and thus ideal for reconstructing and understanding  interannual to
              centennial-scale climate variability in a vast area  of Africa continuing no
              other such record.  This award supports a  project to carry out the field and
              laboratory work needed to  produce the first annually-laminated continuous
              record of the West  African Monsoon and Sahel drought extending back centuries
              and  perhaps millennia.  This record will be used to test relationships 
              between North Atlantic variability and West African rainfall that  have been
              hypothesized using the short instrumental record alone.  Because of its unique
              location, climate sensitivity and  paleoenvironmental potential, Lake Bosumtwi
              has been identified by  the international paleoenvironmental community (i.e.,
              IGBP-PAGES   Past Global Changes  and ICDP  International Continental Drilling 
              Programme ) as a high priority for scientific drilling.  This  project will
              conduct the detailed high-resolution single-channel  and
              intermediate-resolution seismic reflection survey needed to  plan a
              scientifically-optimal and safe drilling program.
