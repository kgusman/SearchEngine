Abstract    :
              This proposed work concerns the development and application of a regional
              coupled general circulation model for the purpose of elucidating the mechanisms
              that initiate, maintain, and terminate the Weddell Polynya - a large area of
              open water within the winter sea ice cover of the Weddell Sea.  This polynya
              was prominently seen in satellite-based passive microwave imagery, and at it
              height, from 1974 to 1976, exceeded 250,000 square kilometers in size.

The
              fully linked model that will be used in this study is composed of an
              atmospheric planetary boundary layer model, a sea ice model that includes the
              effects of a snow cover, and a three dimensional ocean general circulation
              model.  A flux coupler connects the three models by passing the relevant fluxes
              of energy, mass, and momentum among them.  The fine-scale features of the
              polynya will be modeled on a high resolution version of the models that will be
              nested within the lower resolution grid of their large-scale domain
              versions.

The basic initiating mechanism of the Weddell Polynya is thought
              to be the surfacing of Warm Deep Water (WDW) which is entrained into the
              Weddell Sea from its origins within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 
              Normally this warm water (which is warm only by antarctic standards:  its
              temperature is between 0 and +1 deg Centigrade) is kept below depth of about
              300 meters by a colder but less saline (hence lighter) surface layer of Weddell
              Winter Water.  Occasionally, it is speculated, this condition breaks down; the
              atmosphere/ocean dynamics remove the cold surface layer and allow the WDW not
              only to melt the existing ice, but keep new ice from forming.  Eventually the
              WDW heat reservoir is exhausted and a cold surface layer is reestablished. 
              

The expected results of this study are a quantitative determination not
              only of the characteristic time evolution of the polynya, but also its
              characteristic recurrence interval, spatial scale, and its connection to the
              bottom topography of the Weddell Sea.  It is a regional climatic event that has
              global consequences by affecting the formation and distribution rate of deep
              and bottom water thought the world ocean.
