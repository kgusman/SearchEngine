The mechanism and timing of partial melting and melt
              extraction in the mantle beneath arcs constitutes one of the key unresolved
              questions regarding arc magmatism.  This collaboration between researchers at
              the Universities of Minnesota and Iowa will use analyses of U-series nuclides
              and particularly of 231Pa in young volcanic rocks to better understand the
              melting process beneath the Central American arc and to determine how this
              process is affected by fluxes of components from the subducting slab. 
              Preliminary studies show that 231Pa is strongly fractionated from U in the
              sub-arc mantle prior to eruption on a time scale similar to or less than the
              half life of 231Pa (33 kyr), strongly suggesting that 231Pa is a sensitive
              indicator of the timing and mechanism of melting and melt extraction. 
              Measurements of (231Pa)/(235U) and (230Th)/(238U) activity ratios using thermal
              ionization mass spectrometry and (226Ra)/(230Th) ratios using alpha counting
              techniques will be made for an along-arc suite of young volcanic rocks from the
              southern Central American arc in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The southern Central
              American arc is an ideal location for studying melting and mass transfer
              processes using U-series isotopes because many of the parameters affecting arc
              volcanism, such as the composition of the mantle and the mass flux of
              components from the subducting slab, vary across the region in a systematic and
              well-characterized fashion. The resulting data set will be to our knowledge the
              most complete study of U-series isotopes associated with an arc province, and
              combined with the trace element and long-lived isotopic data will yield a
              unique body of data against which hypotheses for melting and mass transfer in
              arcs can be tested.
