This project is a study of the formation of an antarctic sea
              ice cover through the agglutination of ice crystals into small floes
              ("pancakes") which grow and aggregate into larger floes, ultimately forming a
              continuous ice cover.  The objective of the project is to determine how this
              evolution of pancake ice is determined by different environmental conditions. 
              The annual areal coverage of antarctic pancake ice is estimated at
              approximately six million square kilometers, more than a third of the
              wintertime sea ice area.  The project will begin with a field experiment to
              collect a comprehensive data setof the in situ environmental formation
              conditions.  Laboratory work will be carried out subsequently, both with
              plastic simulated ice and with naturally grown ice in an outdoor wave tank. 
              Theoretical and numerical studies will be carried out in parallel.  Results
              from this study will provide quantitative information about the physical
              structure of a pancake ice cover, and its mechanical action under a range of
              environmental conditions.  These results will bear significantly on the
              signature of pancake ice in satellite imagery, its utilization as a habitat by
              sea ice and cold water biota, and its proper effect on integrated global
              climate models.
