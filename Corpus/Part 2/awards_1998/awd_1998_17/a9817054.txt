This research project
              will utilize microfossils and sediment properties to reconstruct the
              paleoceanography of the Arctic Ocean using available sediment cores for the
              period 50-100 thousand years before present.  They will examine the past
              variability and sensitivity of surface water physical characteristics, the
              history of the halocline and perennial ice cover, and the fate of organic
              carbon produced on shelves and slopes as well as variations in surface-water
              productivity and subsurface structure and circulation of the western Arctic
              Ocean.  The reconstruction of past conditions will provide a picture of how the
              Arctic Ocean evolved under the known climate conditions for the past 50-100
              thousand years.  The results will be used to predict how the transport of of
              carbon from continental shelves to the deep basin might proceed until changed
              climate conditions.  The results of this project will provide input for
              planning a large Phase 2 field program of the Shelf Basin Interactions project
              in 2002.
