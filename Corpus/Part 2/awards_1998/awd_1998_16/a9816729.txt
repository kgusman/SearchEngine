Abstract    :
              The zebrafish will be used as a model system to estimate, for the first time,
              the average genetic properties of fitness mutations in a vertebrate.  Zebrafish
              are ideal for this study because of the unique cytological techniques that have
              been developed for this species.  Fish with identical genetic backgrounds will
              be produced that have either no mutations, are homozygous for induced
              mutations, or are heterozygous for exactly the same mutations.  Comparison of
              the fitness of these fish will provide a novel way to estimate the average
              dominance of deleterious mutations, and similar manipulations will reveal
              whether mutations at different loci interact in a synergistic fashion.

The
              use of a vertebrate in this work is important since current attempts to
              evaluate the significance of mutation in humans, domesticated animals, and
              endangered species rely largely on extrapolation from data on flies.  The
              properties of spontaneous mutations influence a number of processes of
              theoretical and practical importance, including the maintenance of adaptive
              genetic variation essential for population responses to natural selection and
              the accumulation of deleterious load that poses a significant risk of
              extinction for small populations.
