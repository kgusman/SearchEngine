Abstract    :
              To cope with unknown multipath propagation in wireless multiuser 
              communications, existing blind CDMA approaches rely on the  received data and
              the user-codes in order to suppress multi-user  interference (MUI) at the
              receiver. Starting with a multirate  equivalent model, this project takes a
              fresh look at designing  appropriate codes that lead to low-complexity
              quasi-synchronous  CDMA systems capable of eliminating MUI deterministically in
              the  presence of unknown and even rapidly varying multipath. Judicious  design
              of user codes converts the effect of frequency selective  channels into flat
              fading. Residual flat fading effects are  handled with differential encoding,
              and  deep channel fades via a  user code hopping technique at the transmitter
              -- an idea  permeating benefits of frequency-hopping to direct-sequence CDMA. 
              Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) follows as a  special case
              and optimal user codes are investigated when carrier  frequency errors, Doppler
              effects, time- and frequency-selective  multipath, oversaturation, and
              different priority users are  involved.  Comparisons and performance studies
              are conducted  using analytical tools, simulations, and real data collected
              from  a software radio testbed.
