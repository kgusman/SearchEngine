     The investigator develops differential equation models
              to
study heterogeneous biofilms in fluid-saturated porous media.
The
              underlying question is how biofilm interactions affect
spatial heterogeneities
              in the biofilm.  Of specific interest are
causes of observed heterogeneities,
              whether heterogeneity is
purely a hydrodynamic effect, whether cell-cell
              communication
through chemical signaling can be responsible for some of
              the
heterogeneity, and whether species competition can be a
contributing
              factor in the observed roughness of the film.  The
mathematical approach
              involves one- and two-space-dimensional
models, the development of analytical
              techniques, and
computational studies.  In the project the
              investigator
collaborates with experimentalists at the Center for
              Biofilm
Engineering and shares mentoring of students with members of
              the
Center.  Understanding the variations in biofilm form and
structure will
              clarify the important issues of transport and
chemistry within the biofilm.
 
                 In the vernacular, a biofilm might be called slime or
sludge.  A biofilm is
              a film of microorganisms that accumulates on
the surface of an object in a
              flowing fluid environment.  The
microorganisms secrete polymers outside their
              own body cells,
which anchor the cells to each other and to the surfaces on
              which
the film forms.  Biofilms can clog pipes, foul the hulls of
ships,
              corrode steel, sour oil fields, or cause infections by
growing on host tissues
              or medical implants.  Because of their
pervasive effects on water quality,
              power generation, energy
efficiency, and product quality, their negative
              effect is felt in
most U.S. industries.  Not all biofilm activity has
              negative
results.  They can also break down contaminants in water or soil
and
              often are used for bioremediation.  The potential of biofilm
process control
              has yet been fully realized due in part to a lack
of fundamental knowledge of
              biofilm form and structure.  Recent
experiments have shown that biofims are
              not so uniform in
structure as once thought.  In this project, the
              investigator
develops mathematical models of biofilms to study
              heterogeneity
in biofilms.  Understanding the variations in biofilm
              structure
will lead to understanding issues of chemistry and transport in
the
              biofilm: how the biofilm grows and what it can do.  He
collaborates with
              experimentalists at the Center for Biofilm
Engineering and shares mentoring of
              students with members of the
Center.
