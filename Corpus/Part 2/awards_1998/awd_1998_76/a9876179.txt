"CAREER: Application-driven Approach for Prototyping Run-Time
  
               Systems for Future Teraflops and Petaflops  Architectures"

Recent feasibility studies for the  next  generation of
              Teraflops  and
Petaflops parallel architectures  indicate that these machines
              will be
multi-layer systems that consist of  many layers of similar
              components
for  memory, processors, and   interconnects with different levels 
              of
performance.  Such designs will  widen the latency gap  between memory
and
              CPU access to a point where no form of CPU-initiated data movement
from memory
              will be satisfactory.  To solve this, research needs to be
directed  towards
              hardware like  "smart"  memories that are pro-active
with  regard to 
              memory-transfers, algorithms,   and software.    This
research focuses on the
              development and evaluation of latency tolerant
algorithms   and run-time  
              software  support  systems  for   adaptive
computations on a multi-layer 
              parallel platform that  is "isomorphic"
to future Teraflops and Petaflops
              systems.  This  project will have an
immediate impact on  Petaflops Hybrid
              Technology Multi-Threaded (HTMT)
design by  providing hardware  designers 
              with feedback  based  on the
behavioral and structural  analysis of an
              end-to-end  unstructured and
adaptive application from fracture mechanics. 
              Also, this project will
provide a  testbed for training the   next generation
              of computational
scientist to effectively  use such multi-layer parallel 
              platforms and
help computer  engineers  to understand the  hardware 
              requirements of
large-scale applications.
