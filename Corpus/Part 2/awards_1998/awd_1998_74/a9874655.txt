Abstract    :
              The overall research objective is to provide a better physical understanding of
              the phenomenon of two-phase turbulent combustion involving the vaporization of
              the fuel drops and the chemical reaction of the fuel vapor with the oxidizer. 
              It is proposed to conduct extensive numerical simulations of evaporating drops
              dispersed in homogeneous turbulent flows with and without the presence of
              chemical reactions.  The carrier phase is considered in the Eulerian frame and
              is treated via Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the problem.  A "two-way"
              coupling between the carrier fluid and the dispersed phase is applied.  The
              results of the simulations will be used to extract Lagrangian and Eulerian
              statistics.  "Explicit algebraic" second moment closures for statistical
              predictions of two-phase reacting flows will be constructed.  The effects of
              the drop's "shape deformation" on interphase transport in two-phase flows will
              be investigated.  The numerical methodology involves the finite element method
              with a volume-of-fluid based algorithm for treatment of the deforming
              interface.

The education plan consists of two activities with a particular
              emphasis on "integration" of research and teaching activities of the PI.  The
              particular geographical and cultural situations of the University of Hawaii
              with respect to other U.S. universities are taken into consideration.  The
              first activity is focused on attracting students to engineering and helping
              them in their transition to professional life.  The second activity is focused
              on a critical examination of current educational system in an attempt to
              implement recent scientific and technological advances in the process of
              training the future generation of scientists and educators.
