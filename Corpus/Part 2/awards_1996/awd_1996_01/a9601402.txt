Abstract    :
                       This is a study of institutional and microeconomic processes concerning
              managers and workers in Russia.  The Russian government's programs of reform
              and privatization  have brought about major changes in the Russian economy in
              the past five years.  These recent transformations and the growing diversity of
              the Russian economy provide a uniquely rich opportunity to test general
              theories in the sociology of organizations and microeconomic exchange.  Now
              that the Russian economy has split into a multiplicity of ownership sectors,
              the relative influence of institutional and microeconomic processes can be
              expected to differ considerably from sector to sector.  Institutional processes
              are hypothesized to be strongest in the state-owned sector, where the influence
              of the government is strongest, and where the "structural inertia" of
              individual organizations can be expected to be greatest because of these
              organizations' greater age.  In the private sector, in contrast, institutional
              processes are likely to be weaker, and microeconomic determinants of employment
              relations should have freer reign.            This study will investigate these
              processes by interviewing managers and workers in  organizations drawn from the
              three major sectors of the contemporary Russian economy: the state-owned
              sector, which in 1994 still employed 46.7% of the Russian labor force; the
              private sector, which in 1994 employed 31.8% of the labor force; and Russia's
              new "mixed" ownership sector, which in 1994 accounted for 20.2% of Russian
              workers.  One organization from each of these sectors will be selected from
              each of five industries  (manufacturing, construction, retail trade, personal
              services, and science and scientific services) in each of three cities (Moscow,
              the national capital; a regional or "oblast" capital; and a small city).   This
              research will test and develop theories in the sociology of organizations, and
              it will gain insight into the dramatic changes currently in progress in Russia.
               Thus it will cont ribute to the knowledge base required by both scholars and
              policy makers who wish to understand the transformation of formerly
              state-socialist societies and the global socio-economic evolution that
              distinguishes the end of the twentieth century.
