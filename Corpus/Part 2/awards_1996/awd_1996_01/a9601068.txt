Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support the Berkeley Geochronology Center will
              purchase a state-of-the-art high abundance sensitivity thermal ionization mass
              spectormeter(TIMS) with multiple collectors, to be used for Uranium series and
              U-Th-Pb geochronology. The precision and small sample size required will permit
              the system to analyze samples and address questions which are not possible
              using more standard instrumentation. The techniques are particularly accurate
              in the 20,000 to 500,000 age range and it was during this period that many
              important events, including the emergence of anatomically and behaviorally
              modern humans occurred. Many sites which fall in this time period are undatable
              by the most reliable methods - radiocarbon and argon-argon - and provision of
              this TIMS will provide information of value not only to paleoanthropologists
              but to geologists, geophysists and ecologists. These techniques can be applied
              to a range of pedogenic material, speleothem or travertine carbonate,
              teeth/bones and volcanic zircons. Many of these are present in
              paleoanthropological situations and the ability to analyze teeth means that the
              techniques can be applied directly to specimens of interest and are not limited
              to associated geological materials.  The Berkeley Geochronology Center will
              provide matching funds to construct a new high-quality clean laboratory and a
              new TIMS laboratory. The resultant servicves which these provide will have a
              direct and major benefit in a wide range of sciences.
