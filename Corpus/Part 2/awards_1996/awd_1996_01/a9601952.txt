Abstract    :
              9601952  Zindler    This grant, made through the Academic Research 
              Infrastructure (ARI) Program, provides $267,500 as  partial support of the
              costs of acquiring a high-  resolution inductively coupled plasma mass 
              spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) to be housed in the  National High Magnetic Field
              Laboratory (NHMFL) at  the Florida State University.  This state-of-the-  art
              instrument will allow this group to analyze,  with high precision and very low
              detection limits,  the trace elemental and isotopic composition of a  great
              number of elements in the periodic chart in  geological samples that are
              important for a more  thorough understanding of the petrogenesis of  mantle and
              crustal materials as well as for a  better understanding of the cycling of
              trace  elements in natural waters.  Specific studies will  include analyses of
              the Sr, Nd, Pb and Hf isotopic  characteristics of mantle-derived ocean island 
              basalts, analyses of the rare earth elemental  (REE) and high field strength
              elemental (HFSE)  concentrations in peridotite xenoliths as  indicators of the
              degree of fractionation and  partial melting within the mantle and the 
              biogeochemistry of Fe and other biologically  important trace metals (i.e. Ni,
              Cu, Zn, Cd)  within the photic zone in the ocean basins and  within estuarine
              sediments.  ***
