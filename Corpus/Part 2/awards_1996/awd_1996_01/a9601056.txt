Abstract    :
                The impression that science is undergoing a new phase of  reorganization and
              retrenchment is widespread, and in response  there have been numerous appeals
              to a revived "economics of  science."  Many commentators and analysts do not
              recognize that  there have been three different theoretical approaches to an 
              economics of science, dating from the 1930s, the 1950s, and a  Newer school
              which has only now been consolidating its position.  Thus, just as
              philosophers, science policy experts and scientists  themselves have been
              calling for a rationalization and  reorganization of science along economic
              principles, or else  criticizing economists for their imperialistic
              pretensions, there  has been very little consensus over what a theory of the 
              "marketplace of ideas" would entail.    The purpose of this conference is to
              bring together the major  representatives of each vintage of the economics of
              science,  along with science policy experts, sociologists and philosophers  of
              science, and some representative scientists concerned with  these issues, in
              order to come to some agreement as to what might  be useful in notions of
              competition, accountability and the  invisible hand when applied to the process
              of scientific inquiry.  One half of the conference will be devoted to
              theoretical issues,  such as the treatment of science as a public good, the 
              application of strategic game theory to the "industrial  organization" of
              science, and the relevant traditions of the  treatment of knowledge in economic
              theory and their bearing upon  the portrayal of science; while the other half
              will be concerned  with more applied policy issues, such as the impact of
              imposing  accountability upon the structure of science, evidence of the 
              decline of a Mertonian "culture of credit" in increasing  hierarchy and
              division of labor, and the economics of the  publication and dissemination of
              findings. The major aim of the  conference is to advance and consolidate the
              emerging field of  the economics of science by disseminating  and evaluating
              the  various approaches in a systematic and comprehensive manner.
