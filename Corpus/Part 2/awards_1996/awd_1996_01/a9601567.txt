Abstract    :
              601567  Brown    A compute tomography (CT) X-ray scanner will be purchased for
              the purpose of expanding the capabilities of several research projects either
              currently in progress at Montana State University or being considered for new
              research directions.  Areas of research include studies on (1) metamorphism of
              alpine snow and changes in microstructure of snow, (2) long term metamorphism
              of Antarctic firn, (3) micromechanics of sea ice and non-saline ice,
              relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties of granular
              materials, (4) damage effects in composite materials, and (5) studies of lake
              ice in Antarctica.  In addition, the acquisition of the scanner will open up
              the strong possibility of establishing long-term cooperative studies with
              Japanese scientist, particularly with the National Center for Earth Science and
              Disaster Prevention (NEID) for snow, ice and polar firn research.    The
              scanner is a transportable system which would enable it to be moved to remote
              sites for field investigations.  With a total weight of approximately 1000kg,
              the scanner incorporates an industrial quality Seifert constant potential x-ray
              source and a detector utilizing a CDD with 1024 X 1024 pixels and a 12 bit
              resolution (4096 grey scales).  Also included are a Pentium computer to control
              the scanner, a color printer, a backup digital tape lead shielding to qualify
              the system as a radiation-free environment.  It has the capability of scanning
              slices as thin as 0.1 mm and has a spatial resolution as small as 10 um for
              those instances where very small details need to be studied.    Courses taught
              in the Engineering college intend to use this instrument to evaluate internal
              structure of materials.  These courses included both undergraduate and graduate
              courses in materials science and soils mechanics.  ***
