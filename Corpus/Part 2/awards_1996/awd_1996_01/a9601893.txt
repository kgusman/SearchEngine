Abstract    :
              9601893  Robertson   Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) replicates in nuclei of
              cells which have excited the cell cycle. Proliferating cell nuclear
              antigen(PCNA), an accessory factor for DNA polymerase gamma, was co-localized
              with TGMV in infected cells but was absent in comparable, differentiated cells
              of healthy plants. PCNA is the first example of a host protein associated with
              geminivirus infections. The specific goals of this work are: 1) To determine if
              TGMV infection causes the accumulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins 2) To
              determine if the viral replication protein, AL1, causes an increase in the
              expression of other host proteins and 3)To determine if TGMV DNA is
              preferentially replicated or if chromosomal DNA is also replicated.  %%%  The
              results of this investigation should lead to important insights into the
              mechanisms and possible linkage of viral pathogenesis and cell cycle regulation
              in the host plant. New approaches for the control of viral plant diseases may
              be developed from the enhanced understanding of such interactions.  ***
