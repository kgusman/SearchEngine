Abstract    :
              9601924  Gibbs    The major objective of the proposed research project is to
              acquire a 500 Mz wide bore Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer
              equipped with probes for flowing imaging, diffusion analysis, and
              electrophoresis.  The instrument requested is an AVANCE DMX 500 WB high
              performance digital nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, manufactured by
              Bruker Instruments, Inc. Manning Park 19 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA 
              01821-3991.  The main purpose of this instrument will be for the performance of
              experiments in multiphase transport phenomena by faculty in the Department of
              Chemical Engineering at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.  Three key faculty
              members, Dr. Stephen J. Gibbs, Dr. Bruce R. Locke, and Dr. Rufina Alamo, will
              conduct experiments in transport in materials science, biochemical and
              biomedical materials, and polymers.  Dr. Gibbs is recently joining the faculty
              and comes with extensive experience in the applications and methodology of
              pulsed field NMR for transport studies.  Dr. Locke has funded research and
              extensive experience in a number of related projects that will utilize the
              instrument purchased on this grant;  the major focus of this work is on
              electrical field driven transport in biomaterials.  Dr. Alamo has funded
              research and extensive experience in the characterization of polymers.  Her
              focus will be on crystallization under flow conditions.  Additional faculty
              members from the Department of Chemical Engineering, including Dr. Pedro Arce
              and Dr. Michael Peters have expertise in the mathematical modeling and
              theoretical approaches for the analysis of macromolecular transport will
              collaborate with investigators on this grant.    The proposed instrument will
              be the focus of an interdisciplinary program that will included chemical
              engineers and other scientists from FAMU with common interests in the
              measurement of molecular transport.  Dr. Hsieh, from the Wetlands Ecology
              Department at FAMU is developing research in multiphase transport in soils and
              will utili ze this instrument in the future.  ***
