Abstract    :
                9601241  Liu                                                                 
              This is a 24 month award proposed by Dr. Philip Liu, Cornell  University  and 
              Professor Ming-Kuang Hsu, Taiwan National Ocean University.  It requests funds
              for participation by a graduate student  and for travel to Taiwan.  The primary
              objective of this  project is to produce a tsunami inundation map for the 
              entire Taiwan coastline.  The tasks include validation of  the numerical model
              and use of the numerical model to  predict the effect of tsunami inundation
              along the Taiwan  coastline.  An educational videotape will be produced to 
              illustrate the generation, propagation, and the coastal  effect of tsunami.
              Tsunami are among the most disastrous  natural calamities on the shore of  the
              Pacific.  Recent and  older observations have demonstrated the suddenness of 
              tsunami occurrence along the Taiwan coast.  This is a very  practical and
              important project, which not only can validate  the P.I.'s tsunami inundation
              model, but also provide a tool  for future land use planning  and for reducing
              potential  damage from these natural hazards.  Furthermore, this  project
              provides an excellent opportunity for a graduate  student to have a hands-on
              experience to carry out a project  in an environment significantly different
              from the U.S.  The  project is jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science
               Council and the NSF.
