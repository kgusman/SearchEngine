Abstract    :
               This is a mathematical study of the diffusion of collective action.  It
              develops mathematical models of the diffusion of collective action in cycles or
              waves of protest, with a particular emphasis on the diffusion of collective
              violence and disruptive collective protest and the ways these are affected by
              cycles of non-disruptive protest, the formation and institutionalization of
              movement organizations, and the social control efforts of regimes.  Recent
              advances in event-history models of diffusion are used as the basis for further
              development of diffusion models which capture temporal and spatial
              heterogeneity and which adequately capture the ebbing phase of a cycle as well
              as its rise.  Multiple-equation models are developed for the interplay among
              different forms of action and between regimes and dissidents.  Computer
              simulation technologies are used to investigate the full response surface of
              all models, showing how the incidence of various forms of actions varies with
              the full range of possible combinations of independent variables. Models are
              developed to represent important phenomena for which there is a body of solid
              empirical data, including several waves of collective violence, and the protest
              cycles of the US Civil Rights Movement in 1950-1990 and the "new social
              movements" of Europe in 1975-1990.  These models are parameterized to be
              consistent with known data, but include variables and relationships which
              remain speculative and unobserved in published accounts.  Alternate explanatory
              mechanisms are rigorously explored and tested for goodness of fit against
              available data.    %%%   This project is a contribution to abstract,
              mathematical sociology.  It will develop rigorous formal theory which is
              capable of identifying general patterns and mechanisms which transcend specific
              cases but which can be meaningfully tested against empirical data.  Thus it
              will strengthen the fundamental intellectual basis upon which more applied or
              policy-oriented studies must rest.
