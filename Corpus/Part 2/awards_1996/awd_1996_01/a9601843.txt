Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will   assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Lawrence University acquire a   inductively
              coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS).  This equipment   will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: (1)    evolution of the
              Galapagos Island Chain (2)  late quaternary history of   the Lake Winnegao
              Basin East-Central Wisconsin (3)  recent anthropogenic   effects on the Lake
              Winnebago Basin (4)  investigation of electronic and   vibrational band
              structure of the semiconductor Ge1-(x)Snx, and (5)    zooplankton nutrient
              supplies in freshwater and marine environments.      Inductively coupled
              plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is an analytical   technique that uses a high
              temperature discharge generated by inducing a   magnetic field in a flowing
              conducting gas to determine with high   precision, quantitative multi-elemental
              analysis.  It is used in   interdisciplinary fields including environmental
              science, material   science and geochemistry for high quality elemental
              analysis.
