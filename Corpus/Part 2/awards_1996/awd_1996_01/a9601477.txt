Abstract    :
                  This proposal from a consortium of faculty from six different  departments
              at the University of Minnesota and researchers from  surrounding institutions
              (e.g., the Mayo Clinic) and the  commercial sector seeks support from the NSF
              Academic Research  Infrastructure Program to assist in the establishment of a 
              cutting edge NMR resource. The University of Minnesota is  committed to a
              developing Program in Structural Biology that will  be housed in the new Basic
              Health Sciences Building scheduled for  completion in August, 1996. The NMR
              facility (4,000 sq. Ft.) will  be located on level one along with other
              integral components:  X-ray, EPR and other spectroscopies, electron microscopy,
              mass  spectroscopy, microchemical facilities and computational  resources which
              will include a supercomputer center sub-site. The  centerpiece of this
              application is the acquisition of a 1 7.6T  NMR spectrometer (1H resonance
              frequency of 750 MHz) as well as  upgrades of existing 11.7 and 14.2 T NMR
              spectrometer consoles.    Over the past few years, multidimensional and high
              field NMR  methodology has revolutionized the role that NMR plays in the 
              chemical and biological sciences. In recognition of these  developments, the
              University of Minnesota has pledged a  substantial commitment to the
              establishment of a premier NMR  facility to support its own faculty and those
              from other  academic/research institutions and the commercial sector in the 
              State of Minnesota. As part of this undertaking, it is proposed  that the NSF
              play a pivotal role in the establishment of a  broadly based NMR facility. An
              initial group of 14 scientists who  would use the facility has been identified.
              Research pursued in  these laboratories impacts upon a wide spectrum of
              problems  ranging from health to material science whose solutions are  rooted
              in the NMR structural elucidation of proteins, nucleic  acids, membrane
              assemblies and inorganic polymers.
