Abstract    :
              In this project, Mary J. Wirth of the University of Delaware is supported   by a
              renewal grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  She   will
              study the adsorption of organic cations to silica-based   chromatographic
              surfaces in order to understand the physical phenomena   responsible for zone
              tailing in chromatographic separations which is a   long-standing problem
              hindering separation of a large number of important   compounds such as
              proteins and pharmaceuticals.   Atomic force microscopy   will be used to
              measure surface charge density over a wide pH range.    Single-molecule
              detection of an organic cation, rhodamine 123, will be   used to probe lateral
              diffusion and desorption rates as a function of   surface charge density, which
              is controlled by pH.  Stationary phases   will be synthesized with varying
              silanol concentration, monolayer   coverage and monolayer hydrophobicity, along
              with horizontally   polymerized monlayers to reduce surface charge density. 
              Adsoption   isotherms will be generated from data obtained by elution of
              rhodamine   123 on nonporous silica gel and tested by performing the
              single-molecule   and atomic force microscopy experiments on the same material.
               In this work, physical and chemical factors responsible for the currently  
              inefficient chromatography of important classes of compounds such as  
              pharmaceuticals and proteins will be  investigated.  The experiments to   be
              done are multidisciplinary in nature, bringing together ideas from   optical
              spectroscopy, self-assembled monolayer research, scanning probe   microscopy
              and chemical separations.  The practical impact of the work   will result in
              faster more complete separations for analysis and   preparative purposes.
