Abstract    :
              9610389  Rosenthal    This project addresses a number of issues in systems
              theory and coding   theory. The main objectives of the proposal are: 1. A
              unified algebraic   theory for general matrix extension problems which, in
              special situations,   covers results of the pole placement and interpolation
              literature on one side   and results on matrix extensions on the other side. 2.
              An extension of the   Hermann-Martin correspondence well known for one
              dimensional systems   to the situation of multidimensional systems. 3. An
              optimal control theory   for linear systems over finite fields which will
              result in methods for   constructing convolutional codes with large free
              distance, low complexity   and simple decoding schemes.    Convolutional codes
              are used in the data transmission over phone lines, in   the area of wireless
              communication and in the transmission of pictures from   deep space. Feedback
              controllers are implemented in many different devices   such as aircraft,
              robots and chemical processes to mention a few. From a   mathematical point of
              view linear feedback controllers and convolutional   encoders are governed by
              similar set of equations. It is the goal of the   proposed research to develop
              a mathematical theory which will lead to   improved design techniques for
              feedback controllers of various type as well   as more efficient convolutional
              encoders and decoders.
