              Abstract  ATM-9610128  Lehman, Scott J.  University of Colorado  Title: High
              Resolution UK37 Alkenone Paleothermometry at Bermuda  Rise: The Last
              Interglacial to the Little Ice Age    Subtropical sea surface temperature (SST)
              is an important climate   boundary condition within much of the North Atlantic
              basin.  It is  not known, however,  whether sub-polar millennial- and century- 
              scale SST changes also affected the subtropical gyre, and to what  degree such
              changes were connected with variations in the rate of  formation of North
              Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).  Recently recovered  long cores, by the Marion
              Dufresne, provide an unparalleled  opportunity to study highly resolved proxy
              records of SST  and NADW  variations.  Work supported by this grant will
              establish a time  series of SST at 50-yr to 100-yr sample spacing for the past
              150  kyr in sediments of the Bermuda Rise using the alkenone  paleo-temperature
              estimation technique.  Similar measurements made  in a pilot study of the last
              15 kyr provide evidence of large  swings in SST during the last deglaciation. 
              This is consistent  with SST estimates from foraminiferal assemblage data.  The
              pilot  results demonstrate that the proposed studies are likely to yield  a
              high-amplitude signal of SST variations for the North Atlantic  subtropical
              gyre.  The fidelity and geographic representativeness  of the Bermuda Rise
              results can be cross-checked at key intervals  by analysis of a second high
              deposition-rate core from Blake-Bahama  Outer Ridge.  Combining this work with
              other proxy studies will  produce paired proxy records of SST and NADW
              variation and will  allow the evaluation of the role of the ocean thermohaline 
              circulation in climate changes occurring on these timescales.
