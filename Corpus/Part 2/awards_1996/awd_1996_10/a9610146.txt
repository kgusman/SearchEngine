Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert H. Crabtree, Department of Chemistry, Yale University, is   supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry
              Division for a study of novel types of hydrogen bonding   that occur between a
              conventional proton donor, an OH or NH group, and an   unconventional acceptor,
              an M-H or B-H bond (M = Re, Ir). Preliminary   data show that these bonds are
              short, strong, and bent at the MH or BH   unit. During this project examples of
              inter- and intramolecular   M-H...H-M' and M-H...M' complexes will be
              synthesized and the hydrogen   bonding in them analyzed using spectroscopic and
              kinetic data. Specific   issues that will be addressed  target include the
              stabilization of HF   complexes, restricting rotation in dihydrogen complexes
              by inducing   H-bond formation, perturbing the fluxionality rates of
              polyhydrides, and   increasing the rate of nucleophilic attack at CO. A
              solvatochromic method   will be evaluated for characterizing outer sphere
              H-bonding interactions.  Interactions between atoms and molecules are the most
              important phenomena   that determine the properties of matter. One type of
              interaction is   called 'hydrogen bonding.' Hydrogen bonding has been known for
              many years   and is responsible, for example, for many of the properties of ice
              and   liquid water. Recently, new types of hydrogen bonds that involve  
              metal-hydrogen units have been discovered. This project aims at   discovering
              general trends in these new types of hydrogen bonds and at   developing novel
              hydrogen bonding situations in order to effect useful   chemical
              transformations.
