Abstract    :
              9610356  Weisman        Cyclones and frontal systems associated with inverted
              troughs have been  found to be a frequent occurrence in the Central United
              States.  A 6-year survey has  shown 247 cases involving inverted troughs in the
              Central U.S. between the lee of  the Rockies and the Mississippi River. This
              relatively frequent phenomenon is not  accounted for in current polar front
              models.        The goal of this project is to build upon prior research by
              determining the  dynamic support for the precipitation distribution during
              inverted trough cases.  The   preliminary survey of inverted trough cases has
              determined that there are two  primary precipitation distributions in cases
              involving an inverted trough: 1) most of  the precipitation falls downstream of
              the trough in the older, modified polar air mass  (Ahead cases) and 2) most of
              the precipitation falls upstream of the trough in the  fresh supply of arctic
              air (Behind cases).  In the 6-year survey of inverted troughs,  42% of the
              cases fell into the Ahead category, while only 9% fell into the Behind 
              category, but several of the Behind cases were major blizzards.  The remaining
              cases  were a combination of the two categories.        This project will
              involve compositing the Ahead and Behind cases for  comparison of forcing
              mechanisms.  Calculations of lifting mechanisms such as  warm advection,
              frontogenesis, and quasi-geostrophic forcing will be performed for  each
              composite in order to identify the relative importance of these processes in
              the  two categories and to enable comparisons between the two precipitation
              signals.  It  is hoped that the results of this project will provide a
              conceptual model for  forecasters to use in real time to improve rain and snow
              forecasting during inverted  trough cases.  ***
