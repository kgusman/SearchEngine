Abstract    :
              The International Conference on Physics Undergraduate Education will be held
              from July 31 to August 3, 1996, at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
              The conference is sponsored by the University of Maryland, the American
              Association of Physics Teachers, the American Physical Society, and the
              American Institute of Physics, and it will concentrate on the changing role of
              physics education in the contemporary university.  Major issues of the
              conference are (1) The physics baccalaureate as a passport to the workplace;
              (2) Physics in the service of students in other sciences and engineering; (3)
              The physics department's responsibility in pre- and in-service education of
              teachers.  Underlying themes are the (1) changing goals for contemporary
              students; (2) results of educational research; (4) role of technology in the
              educational process; (4) challenge to educate all students equitably.    The
              conference is directed by an International Advisory Board who will develop the
              program and speakers list, and will consist of plenary sessions addressing the
              issues, poster sessions, and sample classes demonstrating the most innovative
              and exciting new university physics classes being developed in the world today.
               The results will be published as a summary and recommendations.  The outcome
              will be a better understanding of the best of physics education throughout the
              world and a group of about 400 participants who have seen and experienced these
              developments first hand and can use and build on them.
