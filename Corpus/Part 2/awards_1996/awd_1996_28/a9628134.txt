Abstract    :
              9628134  Egami    The local atomic structure of some technologically important 
              new materials, mostly crystalline oxides, will be determined  by
              non-crystallographic diffraction techniques including the  atomic
              pair-distribution analysis. The materials studied  include superconducting
              cuprates, manganates with colossal  magnetoresistance, CeO2/ZrO2 mixture for
              automotive catalyst  support, and metallic glasses. Many of these materials 
              have  a periodic crystalline structure in average, but show  significant local
              structural deviations from perfect  periodicity that can be critically
              important in determining  their properties. Experiments will be carried out
              using  pulsed neutrons and synchrotron x-rays available at national 
              facilities.  Results will be analyzed by computer modeling  methods developed
              in our group. To facilitate understanding  of the results, theoretical studies
              will be carried out in  collaboration with other theory groups.  %%%  The
              properties of a material ultimately depend on the atomic  structure.  Recent
              research has shown that the local atomic  structure, that is, the structure
              within a few atomic  diameters of an atom, may not be the average structure of 
              the material.  In many cases, such local variations do not  have significant
              consequences, but in many cases the  properties of a material are critically
              dependent on the  local structure rather than the average structure. The 
              purpose of this project is to determine the local atomic  structure of these
              materials using non-crystallographic  scattering techniques.  Three materials
              systems will be  examined, all of which are of technological importance.  ***
