Abstract    :
              Grotzinger  9628257   This project will attempt to improve our understanding of
              the first-order, long-term evolution of carbonate platforms by investigating
              the transition from Proterozoic platforms formed of microbial and abiotic
              carbonates to Phanerozoic platforms formed of calcified metazoan and metaphyte
              skeletons.    The proposed research will attempt to document the detailed
              paleoenvironments of several carbonate platforms and reefs in the Nama and
              Witvlei groups (Namibia) that span terminal Neoproterozoic time, and the first
              influences of calcified invertebrates and metaphytes on sediment production,
              platform paleoecology, and facies development.  We will specifically study:  1)
              the composition and distribution of various facies, 2) the relationships
              between microbialite morphology and microfabric, 3) the relationships between
              microbialities and calcified metazoans and metaphyytes, and 4) primary
              mineralogy of skeletal grains, microbial components, and cements.   We have
              selected three representative units for investigation based on their diversity
              of facies, microbialite and skeletal fossil assemblages, and progressively
              younger stratigraphic positions and age.  In ascending stratigraphic order
              these include:  1) the Bushmanskippe Formation (Witvlei Group), whose basal
              unit (Bildah Member) is considered to be a "cap carbonate" (peculiar carbonates
              possibly associated with deglaciation of Neoproterozoic ice sheets; 2) the
              Omkyk Member of the basal Nama Group which has 3-D stratigraphic exposures and
              contains spectacular microbialite-Cloudina pinnacle reefs; and, 3) the Huns
              Member of the middle Nama Group which contains calcified metaphyte-microbialite
              patch reefs and microbialite-shelly fossil pinnacle reefs.   The proposed
              research will provide important information that will be useful in
              understanding interactions within the earliest calcified metazoan/metaphyte and
              microbial ecosystems, the sources of terminal Neoproterozoic carbonate
              sediment, and impact of skeletal sediment on the f acies and long-term
              evolution of carbonate depositional systems.
