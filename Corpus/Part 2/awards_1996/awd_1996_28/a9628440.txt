Abstract    :
              9628440  Carmichael    This grant provides $124,800 as partial support of the
              costs  of acquiring an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer with  wavelength
              dispersive (WDS) detection to increase both the  range of elements detectable
              and to provide lower detection  limits for major, minor and trace elemental
              analyses of  geological samples over the present analytical capabilities  of
              their XRF equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer  (EDS) which is
              suffering from prolonged use and for which  replacement parts are no longer
              kept in stock.  This new XRF  will allow this group to continue their high
              quality active  research program in a wide range of interdisciplinary areas 
              including igneous petrology, economic geology,  crystallography and
              archaeology.  Specific research projects  will include the geochemical
              characterization of erupted  lavas within the Jalisco Block of Western Mexico
              as  petrogenetic indicators in this tectonically independent  segment of
              continental crust, pedogenic and surficial  geochemical studies as indicators
              of paleoclimates and for  characterization of the major, minor and trace
              element  geochemistry of intrusive and extrusive igneous samples for  which
              isotopic analyses will also be conducted.  ***
