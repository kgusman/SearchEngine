Abstract    :
              MLulticast communication is an essential feature in parallel computers.  It 
              benefits several parallel applications and is useful for shared memory, 
              distributed memory, and distributed-shared memory systems.  Multicasting also 
              helps in supporting a class of communication patterns known as collective 
              operations.  Multicasting can be supported by either hardware or software 
              approaches.  However, the hardware approach is significantly faster than the 
              software approach.  Most vendors of parallel computers are either unaware of it
               or have made unsuccessful attempts at implementing deadlock-free hardware 
              multicasting schemes.  This project is concerned with efficient hardware 
              multicast routing techniques for meshes and switch-based parallel computers.  
              Several implementation details, such as start-up latency, router delays, and 
              multiple multicasts, will be addressed in this project.  The primary objectives
               of the research will include the minimization of the total communication
              latency  by reducing the number of start-up steps required for multicasting in
              meshes.   For switched-based systems, this project will examine alternative
              switch designs  to support efficient deadlock-free multicasting.  Finally, an
              effort will be made  to design low-cost routers that support multicast
              operation.  Two primary  constraints will be observed during this research. 
              First, the cost and  complexity of the algorithms will be minimized.  Second,
              the PI will focus on  techniques that not only support deadlock-free multicast
              operations but also  enhance the performance of node-to-node unicast
              communications.
