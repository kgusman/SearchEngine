Abstract    :
              9628059   Brune   In this project, an instrument to measure tropospheric
              hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals will be tested, improved, and deployed both
              on the ground and from the NASA DC-8 aircraft. This instrument , based on laser
              induced fluorescence in a detection chamber at low pressure, is the product of
              several years of development and field testing under NSF and NASA support. The
              instrument is now sensitive and specific enough for measurements of these
              radicals throughout the troposphere. The primary goal of this research is to
              better understand tropospheric oxidation from the surface to the upper
              troposphere. Another goal is to understand the low mixing ratios of
              hydroperoxyl radical measured in earlier field campaigns.   In addition, a new
              channel will be developed and added to the instrument which will measure the
              total chemical loss rate of hydroxyl radical. This part will consist of a
              discharge flow kinetics system and a hydroxyl detection axis, which will
              receive a small portion of the UV laser light from the main part of the
              instrument. Results from this total OH loss rate measurement will be compared
              to the sum of the products of reaction rate coefficients and measured
              hydrocarbons to test the accuracy of currently used chemical models and
              reaction rates. Different filters on the instrument inlet will allow some
              speciation of the reactants.  ***
