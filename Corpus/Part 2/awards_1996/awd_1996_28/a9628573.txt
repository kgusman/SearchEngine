Abstract    :
                HRD-9628573  Long Island University    "Strengthening the Research Environment
              by Acquisition of a 300 MHz  NMR Spectrometer"    Long Island University's
              Brooklyn Campus requests support for the  acquisition of a Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance Spectrometer with a  superconducting magnet, operating at 300 MHz. 
              The University will  provide non-federal matching funds on a one to one basis. 
                The University is a private institution and its Brooklyn Campus has  an
              enrollment of 8,000 students, more than 50% of whom are  minorities
              underrepresented in the sciences.  This proposal is made  on behalf of the
              department of chemistry, which experiences  approximately 900 undergraduate and
              70 graduate (master's level)  registrations per semester.  There are 41
              undergraduate chemistry  majors:  14 are Black and 3 are Hispanic; 27 are women
              and 14 are  men.  The Molecular Biology undergraduate program (co-sponsored by 
              the chemistry and biology departments) has 20 undergraduate majors:  7 are
              Black and 2 are Hispanic; 12 are women.  The master's program  in chemistry has
              16 majors: 7 are Black, 2 are Hispanic, and 12 are  women.    The acquisition
              of the NMR spectrometer will fill a major gap in  the otherwise adequate
              research and instructional equipment of the  department.  It will strengthen
              the research environment of the  institution and will enhance very
              significantly the research  capabilities of five faculty, will bring about
              significant  improvement in the laboratory training of those student majoring
              in  chemistry.    The proposed research to be performed on the instrument
              includes  classical organic syntheses, the development of new catalysts for 
              organic compound transformations and polymerizations, the  development of new
              materials with interesting electrical  properties, the better understanding of
              properties and  thermodynamics of unsaturated molecules, and the better
              fundamental  understanding and modeling of industrial resin manufacture.  These
               projects are for the immediate future and it is  expected that the  equipment
              will remain in service for the next 10-15 years,  maintained by the University,
              will support many more research  undertakings, and will increase significantly
              the contribution of  this institution to the Nation's scientific research
              activities.  ***
