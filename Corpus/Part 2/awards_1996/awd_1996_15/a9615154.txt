Abstract    :
              ***  9615154  Morison       The proposed work is an extended analysis of a data
              set generated as part of an integrated research program ("Anzflux") into the
              oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern Weddell Sea.  It
              was carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of
              1994.  The work proposed here concerns  long time series measurements of upper
              ocean temperature, salinity, and current speed from a drifting buoy anchored to
              the sea ice.   The eastern Weddell Sea is a region where a warm regime, defined
              by the intrusion of warm circumpolar deep water with temperatures near +1 deg
              C, and a cold regime exist side by side.  The cold regime occurs to the west,
              where deep water is overlain by a thick near-freezing mixed layer. In both
              regions however enough heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt it
              completely.     The specific objective of the proposed work is to improve our
              understanding of how the intense mixing events associated with frequent storms
              affect the structure and seasonal evolution of  the upper layers of the ocean
              and the sea ice cover.  The structure of the upper layers in turn affects the
              stability of the deeper ocean, and determines the depth of convection and the
              longer term variability in temperature and salinity of the deep ocean.  ***  ??
