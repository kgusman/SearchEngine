              PROPOSAL ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:  9615091    Proposal Title:  Curricular
              Development Workshops in Analytical Sciences    Abstract:  The grant proposal
              requests support for two workshops and two one-half day sessions at the 1997
              Pittsburgh Conference.  The purpose of the two workshops is to discuss and
              recommend curricular developments to meet the educational needs of tomorrow's
              analytical scientists.  The Pittcon sessions are proposed as opportunities to
              engage a larger audience of scientists in discussions of the current status and
              the future directions in analytical sciences.  A 6-8 member steering committee
              will be formed to provide advice on the contents and help select participants
              for the workshops and the Pittcon sessions.  The committee will be comprised of
              active and well-known scientists, educators and leaders from 2- and 4-year
              colleges, graduate level institutions, and technology-based industrial
              companies.  The two workshops will be held in the Fall of 1996 and the Spring
              of 1997 at a location in the Washington, DC area.  Some 24-30 participants,
              representing stakeholders in the education and training of analytical
              scientists, mainly at the undergraduate level, will be invited to each
              workshop.  The product of this project will be two reports.  The first one will
              be written in the style of an "executive summary" to describe the contents and
              outcome of the first workshop.  The second report will be more extensive and
              will state the problems with background information, and the recommended
              solutions, as defined and determined by the workshops.  These recommendations
              are intended to provide the framework for the "restructuring" of the education
              and training of analytical scientists to meet current and future needs. 
              Implementation of curricular changes will require the cooperation and support
              of academic institutions, technology-based industry, government agencies, and
              professional societies.
