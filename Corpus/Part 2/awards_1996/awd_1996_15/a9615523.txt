Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    96-15523  Werner  Mechanisms and consequences of trait-mediated
              indirect interactions in a larval anuran community    This project examines
              indirect interactions between species in a food web, and their effects on the
              structure of ecological communities. The effects transmitted from a species A
              to species C through an intermediate species B are termed density-mediated
              indirect interactions when they are transmitted through changes in the
              abundance of species B. There are compelling reasons to believe that
              trait-mediated indirect interactions also can be important in shaping
              communities. These are indirect effects transmitted by changes in the traits
              (behavior, morphology, and life history) of species B. Presently only a few
              studies have illustrated these effects. In this proposal, we use a model system
              of frog larvae and their dragonfly predators to examine when we can expect the
              density-mediated or the trait-mediated indirect interactions to dominate, and
              how they will interact when both are important. We develop a model that
              indicates that the trait-mediated indirect interactions have been strongly
              underestimated, and devise experiments to test these predictions.
