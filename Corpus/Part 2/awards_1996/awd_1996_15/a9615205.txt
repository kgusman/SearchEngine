Abstract    :
              Following the direction provided by the XVIII Antarctic  Treaty Consultative
              Meeting (1994), the Scientific Committee  on Antarctic Research (SCAR) issued a
              Call for Proposals to  Operate an Antarctic Master Directory for a period of at
               least five years.  The International Centre for Antarctic  Information and
              Research (ICAIR) was selected by SCAR and  the Committee of National Managers
              of Antarctic Programs  (COMNAP) to establish and operate the Antarctic Master 
              Directory (AMD)on behalf of the various national programs.    Using the basic
              format of NASA's Global Change Master  Directory (GCMD) which is part of an
              existing International  Directory Network, ICAIR will design a data model for
              an  Antarctic Data Directory System.  An integral component of  this model will
              be development and dissemination of a  Directory Interchange Format (DIF)
              consistent with existing  international data networks but expanded to better
              enable  description of data sets that are unique to Antarctic  research.  ICAIR
              will also establish links with National  Antarctic Data Centers (NADCs),
              supporting them and other  groups collecting Antarctic data, and coordinating
              the  Antarctic DIF with them.  The DIF developed will be  disseminated to all
              NADCs for their use in managing  Antarctic research data information.  The AMD
              is envisioned  as a meta data center with World Wide Web links to the NADCs 
              and serving, at least initially, as a repository for  information about the
              data held by the NADCs.
