Abstract    :
              Goodge  9615562    Abstract    This award supports four meetings of the
              Antarctic Working Group  for Geology and Geophysics (ANTWG^3) over the two year
              from 1996-  1998.  The ANTWG^3 affords a broad conduit for exchange of 
              information between the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program  within the US
              Antarctic Program (USAP), and the diverse parts of  the broadly-defined
              Antarctic earth science community.  As such,  it is a forum for discussion of
              the future goals of Antarctic  geological and geophysical research, and the
              future needs of  researchers from the operational and science support portion
              of  the USAP.  More specifically, the Working Group brings to the  program
              ideas about emerging scientific and technical  opportunities within the fields
              of geology and geophysics,  programmatic needs, and programmatic opportunities
              as perceived  by the wider earth science community.  The Working Group also 
              serves to provide feedback to the program on current logistical  and science
              support issues related to ongoing activities.  The  information exchange
              between the research community and the  Antarctic Geology and Geophysics
              Program, that is facilitated by  the ANTWG^3, allows the US Antarctic Program
              to be better  positioned to support future cutting edge geological and 
              geophysical research and it also promotes better information  exchange amongst
              investigators interested in geological and  geophysical research in the
              Antarctic.
