Abstract    :
              DMS9615340  Huzubazar    This award provides partial support for the third New 
              Researchers' Conference in Statistics and Probability.  Participants at this
              conference are recent Ph.D. recipients and  doctoral students who are within a
              year of completion of their  degrees.  This is the only conference in North
              America  exclusively for new researchers in Statistics and Probability.  The
              first two conferences, held in August 1993 and July 1995,  were very successful
              and had close to fifty participants each.   The conference, planned by the New
              Researchers' Committee of the   Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS),
              will also be listed  as one of the special pre-meeting conferences at the 1997
              annual  meeting of the IMS.    The objective of the conference is to bring
              together, in the  early years of their careers, researchers from diverse areas
              of   Statistics and Probability.  Research areas include  computationally
              intensive statistical methods, Bayesian and   non-Bayesian inference, applied
              probability and stochastic  process, as well as areas with an emphasis on
              application of  statistical methods such as biostatistics, environmental  
              statistics, and engineering.  The conference is limited to  50  participants,
              and lasts for 3 days during which each participant  is required to present
              her/his research in the form of a short  talk or in a poster. Such active
              participation is important for  researchers in beginning stages of their
              careers because it  facilitates an exchange of research ideas.  The program
              also  includes three overview talks by senior researchers on  cutting-edge
              research  in Statistics and Probability as well as a  panel discussion on how
              to initiate a research program.  The  conference will be held before the annual
              meetings of the  Institute of Mathematical Sciences so that participants can
              then  attend those meetings.
