Abstract    :
              9615136  Fowler   This study addresses one of the core questions of population
              biology: What determines the numbers of individuals of a species in a natural
              or semi-natural ecosystem?  Using an existing 15-year data set, a set of
              analytical and simulation models will be constructed, validated, and analyzed
              to answer this question for a native plant species, Texas gramagrass.  Part of
              answering the broader question will be determining the extent to which
              population size and structure is effectively regulated; another part will be
              determining the way in which that regulation operates.  The models will
              incorporate the effects of neighboring plants on each other, the spatial
              arrangement of the plants, differences in plant size, and variation over time
              in all variables,   as all of these factors are likely to be important.        
               Although only a single species will be studied, the information obtained about
              this species' population dynamics will provide insights into the population
              dynamics of many other plant species, some of which are invasive weeds,
              endangered species, or, like the study species, economically important range
              grasses.  A better understanding of plant population regulation will  
              contribute to efforts to manage weeds, to preserve rare and endangered species,
              to predict the effects of grazers and herbivorous insects upon particular plant
              species, and in general to understand and manage plant species and communities.
               In addition, the population models to be developed in this study can be easily
              modified to be of general use.
