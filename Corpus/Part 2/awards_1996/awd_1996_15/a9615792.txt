Abstract    :
                    Abstract  EEC-9615792  Sauer    The power industry must undertake a
              managed redesign of the Nation's Power System so that it can adopt to
              deregulation and to rapid changes in the power requirements and economic
              conditions.  A planning grant was awarded last spring to study the feasibility
              of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Power
              Systems Engineering to address the research needed to create the tools and
              models to aid in the technical design of a future high-performance electric
              power system.  A multi-university I/UCRC in Power Systems Engineering,
              involving Cornell University, The University of Wisconsin-Madison, The
              University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and The University of California,
              Berkeley, and Hmward University as an affiliate, is viable.    The research
              agenda for the Center will address: 1) Simulation Tools for Analysis of
              Alternative Paradigms for New Electricity Business; 2) Market Mechanisms for
              Competitive Electricity; 3) An Internet Platform for Simulating Competitive
              Bidding for Unist Commitment and Schedule; 4) Available Transfer Capability; 5)
              Data Calibration; and 6) Real-Time Control of Oscillations.    The Electric
              Power Research Institute is planning to cost share some of the activities.    
              The Center is being cost-shared with Dr. C. Singh, Program Director,
              Engineering Systems/Power Systems Program, Division of Electrical and
              Communications Systems.
