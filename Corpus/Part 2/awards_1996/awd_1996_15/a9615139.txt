Abstract    :
                9615139  Ritzwoller    Abstract  This award supports a study of the dispersion
              characteristics  (group and phase velocity, amplitude, and polarization) of 
              broadband (20 - 200 second) Rayleigh and Love waves propagating  across
              Antarctica and the southern oceans and to invert these  measurements for higher
              resolution (lateral: ~500 km) `tectonic  scale' crustal and lithospheric models
              of the Antarctic Plate.  For the most part this research will be built upon
              already  existing methodological and data resources.    In previous work,
              reliable frequency-time filtering methods were  developed for measuring broad
              band surface wave dispersion on  large data sets.  These classical methods were
              applied  systematically across Eurasia and are yielding high resolution  images
              of the Eurasian crust and lithosphere.  Second, there now  exists a large,
              steadily growing, and easily accessible data base  of seismograms following
              large magnitude high southern latitude  earthquakes observed on broad band
              digital instruments that have  been emplaced in Antarctica, on southern oceanic
              islands, and in  southern South America, Africa and Australia (e.g., GDSN, IDA,
               IRIS/GSN, GTSN, GEOSCOPE, AGSO, POSEIDON, MEDNET, etc.).  The  application of
              these existing techniques to large volumes of high  quality broad band data
              promises to yield significant new  information about the crust and lithosphere
              underlying the  Antarctic Plate.    As a lead-in to this research, data were
              accumulated from IRIS's  DMC and GEOSCOPE covering the years 1977 - mid-1995. 
              A subset of  these data (~500 events from 1990 to mid-1995) were analyzed to 
              yield preliminary group velocity maps across the Antarctic Plate  from 20
              second to 150 second period.  These preliminary maps  provide new information
              about the following issues (among  numerous others): (1) lithospheric extension
              and rifting in the  West Antarctic, (2) the extent and nature of the East
              Antarctic  Craton, and (3) the nature of the `anomalous' upper mantle 
              underlying the Austra lian - Antarctic discordance.    The new research
              supported by this award will extend these  measurements to a much larger
              waveform data set in order to  improve reliability and resolution.  In
              addition, more accurate  ray tracing methods will be developed and applied to
              optimize  lateral resolution.  The ultimate product will be a shear  velocity
              model underlying the Antarctic Plate to a depth of about  150 km. 
              Collaborations with Antarctic geoscientists active in  the region will
              facilitate the interpretation of these models  once they are constructed.
