Abstract    :
                9623621  Geng    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is
              to study a novel three dimensional (3D) camera concept called the Color 3D
              Camera. The Color 3D camera, is able to capture 3D images of objects in the
              scene at camera's frame rate (30 frames per second or faster). Because the
              system uses only one CCD camera, it eliminates the time consuming and often
              ambiguous correspondence problem of conventional stereo vision systems. There
              are no moving parts, nor mechanical scanning mechanisms.  The 3D camera is also
              able to provide normal color 2D intensity images in addition to 3D range images
              of the scene which facilitates object recognition and sensor fusion tasks in
              many machine vision applications.  The feasibility of the Color 3D camera has
              been investigated theoretically and demonstrated experimentally during the
              phase I effort. The design philosophy of the phase II prototype will be to
              integrate seamlessly system's function modules in a compact printed circuit
              board equipped with multiple DSP processors. All the image acquiring, image
              processing and range calculation will be performed on-board so the real-time
              range images can be produced. Building a seamlessly integrated low cost high
              speed 3D vision system as a product line of Robotronics, Inc. is a key to
              commercialize this SBIR research results of the color 3D camera. Such products
              will make a reliable and inexpensive 3D vision capability widely available to
              many practical machine vision applications.
