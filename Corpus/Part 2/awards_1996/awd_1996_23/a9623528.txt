Abstract    :
              9623528  Bergelson   The environmental impact of grazing can be dramatic,
              influencing both biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems.  Many studies
              have documented loss of biodiversity, decreases in plant population size,
              invasion of exotic weeds, and degraded water quality due to livestock grazing
              on public lands.  Most of these impacts are due to the direct effect of
              herbivory on native plants.  The research funded by this award addresses the
              ecological and genetic factors regulating the impact of grazing on native
              plants. In particular, experiments will address the environmental and genetic
              controls on plant resistance to herbivory.  Plant resistance will be analyzed
              in its two component aspects: defense, decreasing the frequency of attack and
              tolerance, allowing regrowth and compensation for lost tissue (tolerance). This
              research will utilize experimentally manipulations to investigate ecological
              factors which influence the impact of grazing on plants along with modern
              quantitative genetics approaches to mechanistically investigate how plants cope
              with and deter browsing.     Findings should contribute to our knowledge of how
              grazing regimes might be altered to reduce their damaging effects. The results
              will have direct implications for our understanding of the effects of browsing
              on native plants and may provide insight into novel approaches for pest
              management in agricultural systems.
