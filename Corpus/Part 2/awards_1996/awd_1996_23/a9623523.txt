Abstract    :
              9623523  Mueller    The objective of this research is to examine the population
              dynamics and species diversity of fungi which decompose resources, such as
              wood, leaves, or dung, which are distributed in discrete patches.  Ecologists
              have concluded from models of consumer species (e.g., plants, herbivore, etc.)
              that patchiness can allow two species to coexist on a regional scale even if
              they cannot coexist on a local scale, but there has been no comparable work
              with decomposers.  For this study, consumer based models have been altered to
              make them applicable to decomposers.  The decomposer model predicts that within
              a patch the outcome of competition is controlled by (1) initial resource
              density of the patch, (2) resource requirements of the decomposer species, (3)
              the amount of energy a species needs to reproduce, and (4) the efficiency of
              the species at converting resources to stored energy.  The outcome of
              competition over many patches is controlled by (1) the outcome of within patch
              competition, (2) the dispersal ability of the species involved, and (3) the
              rate of input of new patches into the environment.  It can be inferred from the
              models that those factors which promote coexistence of two species will also
              promote the coexistence of multiple species and thus increase species
              diversity.  A better understanding of competition between decomposers has many
              potential applications including:  (1) developing strategies to fight
              economically harmful decomposers, (2) determining how competition affects
              nutrient cycling, which could potentially impact agricultural and
              bioremediation practices, and (3) developing methods for conserving species
              diversity.
