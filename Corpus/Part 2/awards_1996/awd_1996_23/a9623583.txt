Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is threefold.  First, methods will be   developed for
              the preparation of a new class of materials derived from   condensation of
              amino acids with both carboxy and amino termini of   polymeric sialic acid
              oligomers.  Second, solid support methods will be   developed for the
              preparation of a new class of materials utilizing   sialic acid as peptide
              equivalents.  Third, the solution phase   conformation of these materials will
              be examined using nuclear magnetic   resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular
              modeling.  Educational   activities involve a program in chemical education
              directed to developing   discovery based learning methods in organic chemistry.
              With this CAREER   award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research
              and   educational activities of Dr. Jacqueline Gervay of the Department of  
              Chemistry at the University of Arizona.  Professor Gervay will focus her  
              research efforts on developing synthetic routes to novel materials that   will
              selectively replace important biological recognition processes.  The  
              synthetic targets include sialic acid based oligomeric compounds that   will
              disrupt protein-protein interactions involving both helical and   electrostatic
              interactions.  Dr. Gervay's educational activities involve   a program in
              chemical education directed to developing discovery based   learning methods in
              organic chemistry.
