Abstract    :
              9623433  Harte  Global warming and soil organic matter dynamics: an experimental
              investigation of the effects of climate on soil carbon pool structure. Results
              from an ongoing warming manipulation in a high-altitude meadow ecosystem
              indicate that warming may be reducing the stock of carbon in the bulk soil
              organic matter. Since such an effect would constitute a positive feedback
              mechanism to the global warming predicted to follow from current greenhouse gas
              emissions, understanding it is important to fully understanding global warming
              itself The funds requested by this proposal will provide for a further
              investigation of the structure of the soil carbon pool in the study ecosystem.
              The aim is to better quantify the magnitude of the soil carbon loss, identify
              the pools of soil carbon from which it comes, and understand the underlying
              dynamics that will determine the timescale over which it might operate. 
              Specifically, the PIs propose to apply:  1) recent advances in soil organic
              matter fractionation techniques, and 2) new methods being developed to quantify
              the structure of microbial decomposer communities, to soils from the warming
              manipulation. Organic matter fractionation divides soil carbon into pools
              according to turnover time (thereby revealing structure essential to predicting
              the long-term response to warming); identifying any potential shifts in the
              microbial decomposer community that might be associated with changes in the
              soil carbon structure will help illuminate biological mechanisms important in
              ecosystem response to warming.
