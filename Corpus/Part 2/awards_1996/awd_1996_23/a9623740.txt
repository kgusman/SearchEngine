Abstract    :
              ***  9623740  Pritsker    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project will build the Factory-in-the-Computer, abbreviated by F=>C, which
              provides information to improve the management of a company's value-added
              chain.  F=>C will assist manufacturing managers in understanding of the
              performance implications of manufacturing-related business process changes due
              to customer pressures.  Management needs, not technology innovation, will drive
              the design of the F=>C.  To accomplish this, the model of a generic
              manufacturing company, developed in Phase I, will provide a classification of
              business data and decision processes related to the software capabilities of
              the F=>C.  The classification system provides a means to identify business
              processes and to build sample problems demonstrating how they will be resolved.
               At the conclusion of Phase II, reference models will be available for
              describing applications of the F=>C, templates for marketing and sales
              procedures related to the F=>C will be available, and a prototype F=>C will
              have demonstrated how management needs are met in manufacturing organizations
              with the new software tool.    Manufacturing industries are investing heavily
              in programs for improved manufacturing practices.  This commitment has created
              a software market estimated at $2.3 billion/year. The F=>C  concept is expected
              to contribute significantly to this market because it directly relates
              manufacturing change to changing financial conditions of a company.
