Abstract    :
              The focus of this Career Development plan is the development of a new
              broad-based  program in the design of integrated analog systems at Northeastern
              University.   The research component of this plan involves the development of
              analog processing  circuits to be used in integrated circuits containing arrays
              of sensors or  display elements.  The main focus of this research is on
              applications related to  electronic imaging.  The two main thrusts are; (1) to
              develop high quality  imaging arrays with CMOS technology and (2) to devise
              focal-plane computational  imagers for extracting useful information from the
              image data.  The functions  performed by the focal plane processors, which
              include temporal and spatial  differencing and spatial filtering, will have
              applications in fields ranging from  image compression and enhancement to
              machine vision problems such as tracking and  inspection.    The educational
              component of this plan addresses the need to interest and train  more engineers
              in the field of analog design.  The major initiatives of this plan  include
              developing an extended analog design project for second and third year 
              undergraduates; incorporating more undergraduates into on-going research; 
              creating a seminar series bringing outside speakers on campus to increase 
              students' awareness of the importance of analog design in real world systems;
              and  developing an advanced graduate course in analog systems aimed both at our
               graduate research students as well as at engineers in industry who need to
              deepen  their understanding of design principles and techniques.
