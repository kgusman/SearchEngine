Abstract    :
                  This award provides support for the Paul Catlin Memorial Workshop on   Graph
              Minors and Eulerian Subgraphs, which will be held in Kalamazoo,  Michigan on
              June 1-2, 1996. The workshop is structured around a series  of instructional
              lectures, first on graph minors and then on Eulerian   subgraphs. The purpose
              of the workshop is to bring together workers in  these mainstream areas and
              help them to merge their methods and ideas.  The proposed timing and location
              of the workshop are the two days   preceding the Eighth Quadrennial
              International Conference on Graph Theory,  Combinatorics, Algorithms, and
              Applications being held at Western Michigan  University.     This research is
              in the general area of Combinatorics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
              methods to study how  discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The
              behavior of  discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. 
              For example, the design of large networks, such as those  occurring in
              telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with
              discrete sets of objects, and this  makes use of combinatorial research. In
              addition, the type of  enumerative information being sought in this project has
              been of  use in the design of geometric algorithms for problems in  robotics
              and motion planning.
