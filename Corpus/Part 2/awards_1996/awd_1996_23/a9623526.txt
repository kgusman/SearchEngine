Abstract    :
              9623526  Pruett-Jones    While most birds breed and raise young in pairs, a few
              species do so in groups, with several non-breeding adults assisting in the
              feeding and rearing of young produced by a single breeding pair.  In essence,
              these helpers forgo breeding themselves in order to assist the breeding pair. 
              In some instances, it appears that the helping birds are not related to the
              young that they are rearing, making cooperative breeding an apparently
              altruistic behavior, a situation that is rare in nature.   Research funded by
              this award will address the environmental factors that have promoted the
              evolution of this unique behavior. Studies will focus on Australian songbirds
              of the  Honeyeater  group. Honeyeaters are ideal for such research because they
              vary widely in diet, habitat preferences and in the level of cooperation in
              their breeding efforts.  Comparative analyses of the relationships between 
              environmental variables and the occurrence of cooperative breeding within the
              Honeyeaters will be conducted. These analyses will utilize a framework of
              evolutionary relationships between the species, so that behavioral
              characteristics that have arisen in response to similar environmental pressures
              can be distinguished from those arising from shared ancestry.    This study
              will be the first to rigorously test ecological hypotheses for the evolution of
              cooperative breeding.  Understanding the ecological factors promoting
              cooperative breeding in songbirds has implications for the conservation of
              avian biodiversity and for the design of managed breeding programs (e.g., in
              Zoological Gardens) to preserve species that show such complex social
              behaviors.
