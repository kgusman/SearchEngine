Abstract    :
              ***  9623957  Singsaas/Penny     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
              II project addresses the need for improvements in the readout electronics for
              cryogenic radiation and particle detectors whic are being developed for diverse
              applications in astrophysics, particle detection, medical imaging, and
              materials science. Many of these devices use a superconducting quantum
              interference device (SQUID) for reading out the signal from the detector. The
              extreme sensitivity of SQUIDs to small changes in current, voltage or magnetic
              flux are essential for reaching the detection and resolution limits of the new
              detectors. Existing SQUID systems are often ineffectual or of limited
              usefulness in exploiting the full potential of these detectors due to
              limitations of bandwidth and slew rate, which make high count rate detection
              and pulse shape determination difficult or impossible. Recent work on
              high-speed SQUID electronics and improved sensors has shown that performance
              can be greatly improved not only in frequency response and slew rate, but also
              in stability, reliability and noise level. This will be a significant advance
              for cryogenic radiation and particle detector readout. The improvements will
              also aid in enabling laboratory for other industrial, military, and field use
              applications.  SQUID technology to emerge out of the  laboratory for other
              industrial, military, and field use applications.     The technology developed
              here will significantly advance the use of do SQUID systems by providing the
              capability for measurements over a much wider range of frequencies, as well as
              in harsh environments where measurements were difficult or impossible to
              perform previously. Commercial applications benefiting from these advances
              include eddy current and biomedical instruments, ground-based or airborne
              magnetic anomaly detection, and airborn gravity gradiometers.  ***
