Abstract    :
              9623421  Olmstead   Graduate student Alan Yen, with direction from adviser
              Richard Olmstead at the University of Washington, is studying the large sedge
              genus Carex, with an emphasis on collecting new molecular data from nuclear and
              chloroplast gene sequences.  Large genera, by virtue of the sheer number of
              species, are intimidating subjects of taxonomic research, and Carex is one of
              the largest with over 2,000 described species worldwide.  It is also considered
              an ecologically significant group of plants, especially in wetland habitats,
              and for such purposes as wildlife forage and shelter and storm water retention.
               To enhance reliability of species recognition in the genus, improve sectional
              classification, and infer a phylogeny for the group, research is being
              conducted to add new molecular evidence to existing morphological features used
              in Carex taxonomy.  Field work in Malaysia and Taiwan has provided samples of
              critical exemplar taxa, and colleagues in other parts of the world are
              supplying valuable materials for study.  Preliminary molecular data are
              promising; DNA nucleotide sequence data will provide direct measures of
              mutation differences between taxa, and allow inference of phylogenetic
              relationships among the species.  The project adopts an exemplar approach to
              taxon sampling, with the hope that analysis of 75-100 species can provide a
              robust phylogenetic framework for the genus as a whole.   For a large genus
              like Carex, with 2,000+ species and with a limited suite of morphological and
              anatomical characters available for taxonomic discrimination and phylogenetic
              resolution, new sources of evidence are needed.  This project offers gene
              sequencing of nuclear and chloroplast DNA as a source of new data, from a wide
              sample of species collected throughout the world.  Analysis of the new
              molecular data and integration with traditional morphological characters hold
              promise for providing a phylogenetic framework for the group, in turn useful
              for future intensive investigations in systemati cs and ecology of these
              plants.
