Abstract    :
              9623543  Kriegsmann    It is proposed to model and analyze a class of physical
              problems arising in   microwave processing of ceramics.  These problems give
              rise to challenging   nonlinear initial boundary value problems, the
              mathematical statements of   which involve one or more nonlinear parabolic
              equations, governing  the   diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical
              concentration, and the time   harmonic version of Maxwell's equations.  These
              equations are coupled   together in a nonlinear fashion and, in addition,
              nonlinear heat balances are   required in certain applications where surface
              temperatures produce  significant thermal radiation.  It is proposed to develop
              and use asymptotic   methods, dictated by certain physical limits, to simplify
              the mathematical   systems and to develop and use numerical methods to solve
              the reduced   problems.    The goals of the project are twofold.  The first is
              the mathematical   understanding of the basic physical mechanisms which make
              the processes   work.  Such an understanding would give scientists and
              engineers involved   in microwave processing of ceramics the basic scientific
              underpinnings to   judge and interpret their experimental findings. The second
              is the   development and application of asymptotic, numerical, and other   
              approximate methods required to obtain an accurate description of more  
              realistic and complicated processes. The successful completion of the  
              proposed research would allow engineers and scientists to design more  
              efficient sintering and joining processes for ceramics which would produce  
              higher quality materials.  It would also help in the design and  
              implementation of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes which are  
              highly promising in the construction of composite ceramic materials.
