Abstract    :
              Wei Kong of Oregon State University has been awarded a CAREER grant in   the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate ways of   orienting
              chemical reactants to achieve reaction selectivity.  The goal   is the ability
              to selectively cleave a designated chemical bond with   minimum effects from
              competitive pathways.  Using supersonic molecular   beams and moderate electric
              fields, orientation of polar reactants has   been observed.  The oriented
              chemical bond will then be selectively   dissociated by a linearly polarized
              laser.  Depending on the direction of   the transition dipole moment of the
              oriented molecules and the   polarization direction of the laser, one reaction
              coordinate will be   preferentially excited, resulting in selective cleavage of
              a chemical   bond.  Prof. Kong's educational plans include development of a new
              course   on chemical reaction dynamics emphasizing a `case studies` approach,
              and   the teaching of an existing quantum chemistry course from a historical  
              perspective.    Selectivity in a multiple-path reaction is one of the most
              fascinating   questions in chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics, and
              achieving   selectivity has been a major driving force in many scientific
              endeavors.    With selectivity, different reaction pathways can be isolated and
                investigated in detail.  This ability will not only allow a deeper  
              understanding of each reaction path, but also enable investigations of  
              systems that would otherwise be too complicated to tackle.
