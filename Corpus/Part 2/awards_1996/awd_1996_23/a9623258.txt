Abstract    :
              9623258  Harte    Vegetation feedbacks to climate change: extending results from
              an ecosystem-warming experiment to landscape level. Predictions of global
              climate change are based on models that largely ignore climate-ecosystem
              interactions. Yet such interactions may potentially generate large positive or
              negative feedbacks to the climate. For example, shifts in vegetative cover will
              alter energy and water exchange with the atmosphere and could be a significant
              source of feedback To quantify such feedbacks, a detailed and mechanistic
              understanding of climate-ecosystem interactions on the scale of experimental
              plots is needed, along with reliable methods for generalizing knowledge
              obtained from ecosystem experimentation and natural climatic gradient analysis.
              This project will combine manipulations with elevational transect studies to 1)
              deepen understanding of mechanisms and contingent factors that shape
              climate-ecosystem feedbacks, and 2) evaluate and improve the use of transect
              and manipulation studies for extrapolating results about ecosystem response and
              feedback to the landscape scale. The focus will be on a shift in dominant
              vegetation from forbs to shrubs in subalpine meadow habitat in Colorado. This
              ecosystem response to climate variation has been observed over four years of an
              experimental simulation of climate warming. Correlations derived from
              monitoring vegetation and climatic variables along an elevational gradient will
              be compared with results from 1) the existing and continuing climate
              manipulation, 2) additional climate manipulations and reciprocal transplants
              along the gradient, and 3) interannual climatic variation within each data set.
