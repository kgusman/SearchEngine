Abstract    :
              9603078  Johnson    This Americas Program award will fund a 2-year cooperative 
              research project between Dr. Eileen Johnson, Texas Tech  University, and Drs.
              Gustavo Politis, Universidad Nacional  de La Plata, Argentina, and Jose Prado,
              Universidad Nacional  del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires.  They will
              study  the taphonomic  processes involved in the creation of  Quaternary
              archaeological sites in the middle basin of the  Rio Quequen Grande in the
              Argentinean Pampas, with the goal  of increasing the database on prehistoric
              human subsistence  and land use.  The proposed work focuses on the analysis of 
              modified and unmodified bone recovered from the sites.  Modifications will be
              studied on microscopic, light  microscopic, and scanning electron microscopic
              levels in  order to determine their type and source.   Based on the  analysis
              of the bone material, buried soils, and radiocarbon  dating, the researchers
              will try to delineate the formative  and disturbances processes at work at
              sites, the subsistence  base and social structure of the population, and the 
              environmental and climatic setting of their  occupations.    The project should
              advance the comparative understanding of  Middle to late Holocene adaptations
              to grasslands  environments. The linkage among  limnological  processes and 
              human activity in the creation of the archaeological record  is crucial to our
              understanding of early occupations., and  the planned reconstruction of the
              paleolandscapes will  constitute a major contribution to the geoarchaeology of
              the  region.    ***
