Abstract    :
              Lighton  9603873    Insects are among the most important animal on Earth, yet we
               know  very  little  about  their oxygen  uptake  and  carbon  dioxide  
              release   mechanisms  (external   respiration   or  `breathing').   Many 
              insects  breathe  discontinuously,  in  discrete  events  or  "bursts" spaced 
              several  to  tens  of  minutes apart.  The detailed nature of this pattern
              which is  called  a  Discontinuous Gas-exchange Cycle or DGC is  being 
              explored  in  my  laboratory,  using  several  diverse   ant  species,  other 
              insects, and tracheate arachnids  as  model  organisms.   For  a  small animal
              in  an  arid  environment,  breathing as model organisms.  For a small animal
              in an arid  environment, breathing can be a major avenue of  water  loss  yet 
              must  continue  if  the animal  is  to  live.   We  are  investigating  the 
              internal physical and  chemical  factors  which  control the timing of the DGC;
              how the DGC  functions  in  conserving water reserves; and the environmental
              factors  driving  the  evolution and maintenance  of  the  DGC.   The  result 
              will  be  the  first  in-depth,  comprehensive   and  quantitative  account of
              discontinuous external  respiration  phenomena;  including their control,
              implications  for  body  water  conservation,  and independent evolution  in 
              several  very  different tracheate arthropods.  Our findings may also  increase
                our   understanding  of  potential  physiological  targets  for  the  control
               of  medically  and  economically  important arthropods.
