Abstract    :
              9603611  Sejnowski    MCell is a general purpose software tool that allows users
               to accurately simulate a wide variety of the signaling  processes carried out
              by living cells.  Many cells secrete  signal molecules that are detected by
              receptor molecules on  the surfaces of other cells.  Since this involves
              diffusion  of the signal molecule over a distance between the cells, it  is
              necessary to take into account the shapes of the cells  and the locations of
              the molecules to accurately predict the  speed and strength of signaling. MCell
              is unique in its  generality and in the way it simulates cellular signaling 
              using random numbers and probabilities, a so-called "Monte  Carlo" method.
              MCell has already been used to simulate  synapses, which are specialized
              microscopic structures where  communication takes place between nerve cells,
              called  neurons.  It can also be used for more general cellular  signaling
              between and within cells, not just neurons, so it  will be useful to a wide
              range of scientists who are  interested in problems such as how cells divide
              and how this  process may be subverted in the case of cancer.  MCell will  be
              tested initially by a group of scientists who want to use  it to answer
              questions that arise in their research into  signaling between neurons.  This
              will help in making the  program easier to use and more flexible in its
              application  to an even wider range of biological and chemical problems.  Two
              educational workshops will be held to teach scientists  how to use MCell and to
              exchange ideas and results obtained  with MCell.
