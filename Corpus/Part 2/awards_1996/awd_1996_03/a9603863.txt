Abstract    :
              9603863  Collins    The task of maintaining an upright posture involves a 
              complex control system even in a healthy, young individual.  This project is
              designed to increase the understanding of  the nervous system, muscle, and
              biomechanical factors that  influence postural control. The project uses a
              newly  developed quantitative approach to studying postural control  called
              "stabilogram-diffusion analysis" (SDA) to analyze the  subtle postural
              adjustments and movements individuals make  as they stand. Experiments use this
              analysis to examine such  adjustments in relation to different influences on
              posture  such as muscle activity levels and the body's inertia. The  results
              are then used to understand the role of different  sensory and motor control
              systems in maintaining effective  postural control. This project will
              significantly improve  the understanding of how the body effectively controls 
              posture and movement, and in so doing will provide insights  important for
              understanding the postural control  difficulties that result from aging or
              balance disorders.  Its results will also be important for the development of 
              mechanical systems such as prosthetic limbs or robotic  devices that require
              fast, effective control of stable  platforms.
