Abstract    :
              9603884  Roux  The detection of a plant apyrase, formally an enzyme that
              hydrolyzes NTPs/NDPs, to be located both in the cell wall and in the nucleus
              provides the basis for a proposal to study the function of the enzyme.  The
              enzyme is light-induced.  Localization of the protein in either wall space or
              nucleus is regulated by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent signaling process and
              binds DNA and calmodulin.  Transgenic antisense-apyrase Arabidopsis show
              developmental abnormalities which can be mediated by the external addition of
              ATP.    The hypothesis based on such findings assumes a role for the enzyme in
              meristematic tissues that regulates cell growth dependent on light and internal
              hormonal changes that control amounts of free calcium.  The proposed work
              approaches the functional characterization from different angles:
              immunocytological localization, knock-out experiments, and biochemical and
              physiological studies in transgenic plants.  One aspect, documented very
              recently, is that the enzyme is abundant in cells that are undergoing apoptotic
              death, for example in cells in developing xylem vessels.  The work combines
              several approaches to a functional characterization of a unique enzyme that has
              all the characteristics as a major player in developmental decisions, including
              apoptotic cell death.
