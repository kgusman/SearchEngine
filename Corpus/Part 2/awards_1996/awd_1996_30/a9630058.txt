Abstract    :
              Commercial microprocessor systems are being operated at higher and higher clock 
              rates. Faster clocks impact the time that is available to fetch data from cache
               memory, and increases the probability of transient error occurrence in cache 
              memory systems. Besides data reading error, an error may also occur in the 
              processor subsystem, and it may write erroneous data into the cache memory. 
              Error-correcting codes allow detection and recovery from some of these errors 
              within the code word limits. Fast error detection allows damage containment and
               reduces the recovery time, which otherwise could be very expensive in time.
              The  goals of this project are: (1) to study the extent of error propagation
              due to  transient faults in computer system when a fault originates either in a
              processor  register or a cache location; and (2) to develop techniques and
              hardware support  needed for early detection and recovery from such errors in
              computation tasks  with low overhead and low performance loss. The proposed
              techniques will cover  a broad spectrum from only detection to full error
              recovery. This research will  identify architectural features which, when
              provided in commercial  microprocessors, will make them suitable for use in
              fault-tolerant applications.  The intent is to keep the performance impact in
              the normal operation to a  minimal.
