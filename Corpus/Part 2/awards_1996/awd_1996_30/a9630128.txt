Abstract    :
              9630128  Staehelin    This is a workshop (to be held March 18, 1995, in
              Tamarron, Colorado, as part of the Keystone Plant Extracellular Matrix
              Symposium)  to explore an emergent frontier in cell biology, the chaperone
              function of proteins (and perhaps oligosaccharides) which recognize glycans and
              are transiently involved in the folding, assembly, processing, and
              intracellular traffic of glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins,
              oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.  The workshop has a dual purpose, to
              present new research in the area and to assess the utility of the paradigm on
              an interkingdom level.  Invited platform presentations representing current
              interkingdom work will discuss new data on the assembly, processing, and
              traffic of glycoconjugates.  Featured topics will include the chaperone
              functions of calnexin and calreticulin, the role of N-glycans in sorting to the
              apical domain of polarized mammalian cells, and the role of accessory
              polysaccharides and proteins in assembly and function of the cell wall.  Short
              oral presentations will be selected from participants at the meeting wishing to
              present data which support or question the paradigm.  A panel of discussants
              will, with audience participation, help assess how the presented work relates
              to chaperone function.  ***
