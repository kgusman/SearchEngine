Abstract    :
              9630092  Howe    This research effort employs high-resolution analytical 
              electron microscopy to address several fundamental questions  concerning the
              interfacial structure and growth kinetics of  precipitate interfaces in metal
              alloys.  Specifically, the  diffusion fields (solute concentration profiles)
              surrounding  growth ledges on the faces of gamma precipitate plates and  the
              plate edges in an Al-Ag alloy are determined using the  high-resolution (0.14
              nm image resolution), small-probe (0.5  nm diameter) capabilities of a
              field-emission transmission  electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an
              energy-dispersive  X-ray spectrometer (EDS).  These data are compared with 
              concentration profiles obtained from theoretical models to  provide the first
              tests of these models.  The Gatan imaging  filter (GIF) on the same microscope
              is used in conjunction  with the 0.5 nm probe to obtain electron energy-loss
              spectra  (EELS) across the faces, edges and ledges of gamma hydride  plates in
              Ti-H alloys.  These data make it possible to  determine whether the titanium
              hydride structure is fully  formed at the transformation interface or whether
              the  compositional and structural changes may be decoupled in  this mixed-mode
              transformation. Such analyses should clarify  key fundamental questions related
              to the growth of  precipitate plates in metal alloys.  %%%  This experimental
              research provides theorists important  information on the concentration
              profiles in the vicinity of  ledges on the faces of growing precipitate plates
              during  early stages of growth. Ti-H alloy research explores the  question of
              whether shear of Ti permits the titanium  hydride, TiH, to grow.  The mechanism
              of growth is obscure  at the present time, but the hydride is an undesirable
              phase  in titanium alloys.  ***
