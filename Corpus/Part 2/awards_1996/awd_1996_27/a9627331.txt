Abstract    :
              9627331  Tadesse    The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will fund a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit which will allow Dr. Nigatu Tadesse to work with
              Dr.  S. Rajaram at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement  Center
              (CIMMYT) in Mexico.    The goal of this research is to explain the inheritance
              of  osmoregulation, relative water content, and excised leaf  water retention
              (plant-water relations) as droughtresistance  mechanisms in wheat.  The
              objectives are:  1) to identify  and map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of
              plantwater  relations; and 2) to determine if there is a genetic  relationship
              between plant-water relations traits and yield  under water stress
              environments.  The long-term goals of the  project are to develop marker-based
              selection tools to  facilitate selection for drought-resistant wheat genotypes 
              and provide a linkage map that will enable map based cloning  for plant-water
              relations genes.    ***
