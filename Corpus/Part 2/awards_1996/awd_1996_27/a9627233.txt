              Jones, Principal Investigator    This award provides funding to the National
              Society of Professional Engineers to help support the 1996,1997, and 1998, 
              National Engineers Week/Discover  E : Reaching Out to the Next Generation of
              Engineers Programs.   National Engineers Week is a public outreach program
              conducted by the U.S. engineering community .  Over the last forty years, it
              has evolved into a popular and highly visible program with a special emphasis
              on student outreach activities.  Understanding that young people can develop
              positive attitudes about the scientific and technical professions if approached
              creatively, the National Engineers Wekk Committee has developed a stimulating
              program called Discover  E .    The National Engineers Week Committee provides
              print and audio-visual materials to engineers participating in Discover  E 
              Teach-ins and other public outreach activities.  Discover  E: engineers share a
              common desire: to help grade school and high school students discover the
              exciting world of engineering and technology.  Their goal is to help students
              and teachers realize the practical appplications that math, science, and
              engineering have to the world around them.
