Abstract    :
              Machesky   The adsorption of ionic species by mineral surfaces influences many
              geochemical phenomena including the transport and fate of contaminants, mineral
              dissolution and precipitation reactions, colloidal stability and various
              oxidation-reduction reactions. Many of the variables that influence adsorption
              processes have been extensively studied including pH, type of mineral surface,
              type and concentration of adsorption species, ionic strength, and time
              (kinetics). Temperature can also profoundly influence ion adsorption, but
              studies at other than room temperature are rare, and above 100C adsorption
              studies are virtually nonexistent. In contrast, other geochemically important
              and related phenomena such as homogenous solution equilibria and mineral
              solubility and dissolution kinetics have been studied over a much broader
              temperature range.   To begin to remedy this imbalance, this study will
              investigate how ion adsorption by a model oxide surface (rutile) is influenced
              by temperature over the broad range from room temperature to 295C. After ion
              adsorption by rutile has been sufficiently well characterized, studies of ion
              adsorption by the quartz (SiO2) surface will also be performed. The specific
              objectives of this research are:      1) A comprehensive  characterization of
              hydrogen ion adsorption by the metal oxides rutile and         quartz as
              functions of temperature and electrolyte concentration and composition using a 
                   stirred hydrogen electrode concentration cell (SHECC). The success of
              initial efforts in this area        a prime motivation for this study.     2)
              Direct determination of hydrogen ion adsorption enthalpies using titration
              calorimetry over a       more limited temperature range (to 75C) but similar pH
              and electrolyte concentration and         composition ranges as those used for
              the SHECC experiments. These experiments will provide         direct 
              measurements of hydrogen ion adsorption enthalpies for comparison with those
              obtained      from the variable-temperature mea surements with the SHECC. These
              calorimetric           measurements will be the first such experiments
              conducted over this broad temperature range.     3) Characterization of model
              cation (zinc) adsorption by rutile and quartz and model anion        (oxalate)
              adsorption by rutile over the temperature and electrolyte composition ranges
              used for         the hydrogen ion adsorption studies. Parallel calorimetric
              experiments (to 75C) to directly         determine zinc and oxalate adsorption
              enthalpies will also accompany these variables           temperature for
              comparative purposes.     4) The use of the surface complexation modeling 
              approach to describe the resulting adsorption         data with the goal of
              identifying a single model, relatively free of fitting parameters, that can    
                 adequately describe all the data generated between 25 and 295C. This will
              provide a consistent        and powerful framework for data interpretation and
              will also increase the utility of the results to      the geological community.
                  The investigation is novel because the study of ion adsorption processes
              will be comprehensively extended into the hydrothermal regime for the first
              time. Moreover,  the conclusions of this study will have broad applications to
              those areas of the geosciences concerned with reactions at the solid-liquid
              interface because the ion adsorption properties of many other cations and
              anions will be generally similar to those of zinc and oxalate. Consequently,
              the results of this study will hopefully stimulate and help guide additional
              research into this virtually unexplored area of the geosciences.
