Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program,
              targets the development of nanostructured gold surfaces  which will be applied
              to fundamental studies of interfacial  electrochemistry, spectroscopy, and
              microscopy.  During the tenure  of this thirty-three month standard grant,
              Professor Michael Natan  and his students at Penn State University will
              fabricate tailored  gold surfaces by self-assembling nanometer sized gold
              particles  onto substrates covered with organic or inorganic thin films.  
              These gold surfaces will then be used for probing the direct  voltammetry of
              redox enzymes, for the optimization of metal  roughness for surface enhanced
              Raman spectroscopy (SERS), for  studies of electron transfer through organic
              films, for SERS  spectroscopy of proteins, for the development of near-field
              SERS  microscopy, and for the controlled electrochemical release of  molecules
              from a single nanoelectrode.  Microstructured metal surfaces offer unique
              properties which can be  advantageously exploited in a broad range of
              electrochemical,  spectroscopic, and microscopic applications.  Using molecular
              self-  assembly protocols, Professor Michael Natan and his students at  Penn
              State University are pioneering techniques for tailoring  microstructured gold
              surfaces for use in these applications.  The  successful pursuit of the goals
              of this project should give rise to  significant progress in electrochemical
              and optical sensors, and  could afford new techniques in near-field optical
              microscopy.
