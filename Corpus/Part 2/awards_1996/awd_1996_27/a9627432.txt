Abstract    :
              9627432  Haglund   James B. Haglund received his doctoral degree from the
              University of Georgia and   will pursue research under the guidance of Bruce
              Berndt at the University of Illinois. The   research is on enumerative
              combinatorics problems coming from the study of special   functions arising in
              number theory, including the investigation of connections between   rook
              polynomials and hypergeometric series.  %%%   The Mathematical Sciences
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to   recent recipients of doctoral
              degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a   means of
              contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. As 
               researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their interactions with other
              disciplines,   and as the interplay increases between the various areas of
              mathematics itself,   opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are
              becoming increasingly important.   The Fellowships are designed to permit
              awardees to choose research environments that   will have maximal impact on
              their future scientific development. The fellowship is   designed to provide 24
              months of support divided into 18 academic-year months and three   periods of
              two summer months. The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship  
              option which allows for full time support for any 18 academic year months in a
              three year   period, in intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2)
              the Research   Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic
              year support to be taken as   nine months of full time support and 18 months of
              half time support. Not more than two   months of summer support from this
              Fellowship may be received in any calendar year.  ***
