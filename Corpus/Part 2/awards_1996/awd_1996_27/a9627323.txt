Abstract    :
              9627323  Von Jouanne         The general drive towards automated high efficiency
              and low  cost control of ac motors has resulted in an increased  application of
              solid state electronic Adjsutable Speed Drives  (ASDs) in all levels of the
              power system.  The recent  advancements in power electronic devices have
              enabled high  frequency switching operation and have improved the performance 
              of pulse-width modulated (PWM) inverters for driving induction  motors.        
              In a typical ASD application a rectifier and a high  frequency PWM inverter
              control both the voltage and frequency  applied to the motor and thereby
              achieve variable speed operation  over a wide range.  High switching
              frequencies (2 to 20 kHz) are  common with the present day insulated gate
              bipolar transistor  (IGBT) technology for power levels over 200 kW.  However,
              while  the high switching speeds and advanced PWM switching schemes 
              substantially improve the performance of the PWM inverter-fed  induction
              motors, the associated high rate of voltage rise  (dv/dt), of 0 to 600V in less
              than O.1 us, has adverse effects on  the motor insulation, and can contribute
              to bearing and leakage  currents.       In response to these problems, the
              objective of this  proposal is to analyze the effects of the application of
              ASDs on  the operation of ac motors, investigate mitigation techniques and 
              bring the results into the graduate and undergraduate power  electronics
              curricula as appropriate.  ***
