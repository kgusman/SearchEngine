Abstract    :
              Frank  9627259  Most organisms have a community of bacteria, viruses and other
              microorganisms living within their bodies.  These microorganisms are called
              symbionts.  Some of these symbionts are parasitic, causing harm to their hosts.
               In other cases the hosts depend on their symbionts for nutrients, digestive
              enzymes and defense against other parasites.  This study analyzes the evolution
              of symbiont life history traits.  These traits include reproductive rate within
              the host, the time-course (life-span) of infection, mode of transmission
              between hosts, and harm or benefit to the host.  The host's potential to
              control their symbionts will also be analyzed.  For example, some hosts appear
              to manipulate the timing and mode of their symbionts' reproduction and
              transmission.  Such host control may have a strong influence on the tendency of
              symbionts to evolve from harmful to beneficial partners.    This research
              develops mathematical and computer models to clarify the basic processes that
              influence host-symbiont evolution.  The general models are then applied to a
              wide range of particular systems.  One example focuses on the varying degree of
              harm (virulence) that bacteria cause their hosts.  A second example is the
              relationship between mode of transmission and the life history of symbionts
              that aid the digestive processes of their insect hosts.
