Abstract    :
                                          Abstract                                    This
              project is a collaborative effort among the University of  New Hampshire, U.S.
              Geological Survey,  International Center for  Antarctic Information and
              Research (ICAIR), and the Institute for  Geological and Nuclear Sciences Ltd.
              (New Zealand).  The purpose  of this project is to build a Geographic
              Information System (GIS)  describing the of the Dry Valleys in Antarctica as it
              existed in  1993-95.  To ascertain recent natural changes in this  environment,
              the Principal Investigators will add to the GIS  environmental information on a
              decadal over the preceding forty  years.  The study region, consisting of the
              Wright Valley,  Victoria Valley, and Taylor Valley, will be mapped at a scale
              of  1:50,000.  Inside the study area, two "supersites" will be  studied at a
              scale of 1:10,000.    To support the environmental inventory for 1993-95, the
              framework  will be significantly enhanced.  SPOT panchromatic and Landsat 
              Thematic Mapper will be rectified and merged for the entire study  region. 
              Topographic data at the 1:50,000, currently referenced  to an outdated
              astronomic datum, will be updated to the current  WGS84 satellite datum. 
              Digital orthophotographic maps at  1:50,000 for the entire region and 1:10,000
              for the supersites,  will be produced.  Numerous aerial photographs of the
              regions  will be computerized.  Digital basemaps of glacier and hydrologic 
              features will be derived from satellite imagery for the 1:50,000  analysis and
              from digital orthophotographic maps for the 1:10,000  analysis.    The
              geological inventory will use a genetic systems approach to  compile surface
              and subsurface data on unconsolidated sediments,  bedrock, and geomorphic
              features.  In the glacial//hydrological  meltwater summary, various lake stream
              and glacier attributes  will be compiled to quantify glacial meltwater
              production and  transportation.    To describe changes in the Dry Valleys,
              environmental data will  be compiled into the GIS  for 1983-85, 1972-74 and
              1957-59.  Satellite imagery for 1973-74 and 1983-85 will be rectified and  used
              to provide basemaps of glacier and hydrologic features.  Pertinent aerial
              photography acquired during the latter intervals  and during 1957-59 will be
              inventoried and used to supplement the  characterization of glacier and
              hydrologic features.  Pertinent  aerial photography acquired during the latter
              intervals and  during 1957-59 will be inventoried and used to supplement the 
              characterization of glacier and hyrdologic features.  A  comparison of four
              time periods will reveal physical rates of  change in the study area over the
              past forty years.    This research will provide a foundation for long-term 
              environmental management of the Dry Valleys and short-term  environmental
              impact assessments.  This research will result in  the digital availability of
              enhanced framework data including  topography, satellite imagery, and aerial
              photography.  It will  establish an Antarctic scientific data repository that
              will  increase the availability of Antarctic scientific data for  scientists
              and for improved management of science.  Finally, the  quantification of recent
              change in the Dry Valleys constitutes a  contribution the study of Antarctic
              climate change.
