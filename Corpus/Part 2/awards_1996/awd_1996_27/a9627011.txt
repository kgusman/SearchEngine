Abstract    :
                9627011  Gudenkauf    National Public Radio will produce and distribute a
              weekly, one-hour program entitled, "Weekly Edition:  Science, The Environment,
              and Technology," which consists of a compilation of the best science stories
              aired during the previous week on "Morning Edition,"  "All Things Considered,"
              and "Weekly Edition."  Each program will be varied, looking back at the week in
              science and reviewing main stories.  The hour format also will enable the
              producers to go into greater depth than was done in the daily coverage.  They
              will expand the news pieces with additional interviews and/or out-takes
              reporters were unable to use on the daily programs.  As part of the NPR
              outreach program, the project will develop  "Weekly Science" on "Kids
              Connection (Science Friday)" as part of the World Wide Web.  Each week, that
              week's program as well as additional science information and bibliographies
              will be entered on the "Science Friday" homepage.    The PI and executive
              producer for the series will be Anne Gudenkauf, Senior Editor at NPR.  Richard
              Harris and Joe Palca will host the series.  Harris has been an on-air host for
              NPR produced summaries of congressional action on health reform and both have
              substituted for Ira Flatow on NPR'S TALK OF THE NATION:  SCIENCE FRIDAY.  The
              program producer will be Jane Greenhalgh.
