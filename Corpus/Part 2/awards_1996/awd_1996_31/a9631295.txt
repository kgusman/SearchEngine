Abstract    :
              9631295  Gardner  This project will upgrade the quality of specimen storage and
              cataloguing of the Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology (HWML) of the
              University of Nebraska State Museum, as well as incorporate several other
              collections that recently have been donated to HWML.  Slides and vials will be
              repaired and relabelled and vial lids replaced, and the specimens will be
              transferred into fireproof, climate-controlled cases in a recently expanded
              collection room.  The methods used will be up-to-date, archival techniques that
              will conserve the collection well into the future.  In addition, the several
              collections will be catalogued in a common, computerized system. The results of
              this effort will allow HWML staff to provide identification services, research
              data, and educational information to a wide variety of users, including medical
              and veterinary clients, researchers at other institutions, and the general
              public.  Support for the project is in partnership between the Research
              Collections in Systematics & Ecology program of the NSF and the University of
              Nebraska, which recently funded the renovation of the space and is providing
              in-kind and monetary matches to the NSF award.
