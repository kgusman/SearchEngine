Abstract    :
              9631019  Storm    Interest in Solid State Chemistry has grown dramatically in 
              recent years, encouraged by both the recognition of the  technological
              importance and scientific challenges in the study  of new materials and the
              interest of students in what they feel  as a `relevant' area of science.  The
              advent of initiatives such  as the Advanced Materials Processing Program as a
              national thrust  in the synthesis and processing of new materials has put Solid
               State Chemistry in the spotlight.  Funding is provided for  partial support of
              the 1996 Gordon Conference on Solid State  Chemistry to be held at Colby-Sawyer
              College, New London, NH  during July 14-19, 1996.  Invited speakers have been
              drawn from  research groups in academia and industry.  %%%  Solid-State
              Chemistry is a growing and dynamic field of study.  In addition to leading
              scientists from the U.S., world class  scientists from Britain and France have
              been included to make  contact with the broad international research effort in
              this  area.  The Gordon Research Conference Special Fund has provided  $15,000
              towards the cost of speakers and discussion leaders for  the Solid State
              Chemistry Gordon Conference.  The NSF funds are  intended for the support of
              ten graduate students and young  faculty to give them the opportunity to meet
              and participate in  scientific discussions with the leaders in the field of
              Solid  State Chemistry.  ***
