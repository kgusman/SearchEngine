Abstract    :
              9631751  Hallgren        This award is to provide support to help defray travel
              expenses incurred by  select U.S. graduate students and those in post-doctoral
              positions that will allow  them to attend and present papers at the 7th
              Conference on Mesoscale Processes,  jointly sponsored by the American
              Meteorological and Royal Meteorological  Societies.  The conference will be
              held 9-13 September 1996 on the campus of the  University of Reading. 
              Endorsement and co-sponsorship for this meeting has also  been obtained from
              the World Meteorological Organization's Commission on  Atmospheric Sciences. 
              The conference will host sessions on a number of  phenomena and research
              programs of interest internationally, including mesoscale  aspects of fronts
              and frontal cyclones (with emphasis on the upcoming joint U.S.-  European
              Fronts and Atlantic Storm Tracks Experiment), orographic flows and  gravity
              waves (including work relevant to planning for the Mesoscale Alpine Project, 
              tropical convection (the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean - 
              Atmosphere Response Experiment), and related modeling and forecasting
              activities.        The setting on the campus of the University of Reading will
              not only allow  for desirable reduction of per diem costs, but also affords
              ready access to such  notable facilities as the European Center for
              Medium-Range Weather Forecasting,  the United Kingdom Meteorological Office,
              and Oxford University.  Support  provided under this proposal will be
              distributed to a limited number (approximately  12-15) graduate students or
              beginning post-docs who meet the following eligibility  requirements: (1) is a
              U.S. citizen, (2) has a paper accepted for oral or orally-  introduced poster
              presentation at the Conference, and (3) agrees to cost share their  travel
              costs.  The selection process and actual distribution of funds will be 
              administered by the executive office of the American Meteorological Society.
