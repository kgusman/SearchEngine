Abstract    :
              An Analysis of Retrospective Utility  In prior research, the PI has examined how
              experienced utility/disutility - the pleasure/pain of an activity as it occurs
              - relates to the retrospective or recalled utility of that activity.  To date
              the PI has examined this relationship in the context of unpleasant activities. 
              He has found that the retrospective disutility of an activity is accurately
              predicted by a simple average of the most extreme discomfort reported during
              the activity and the level of discomfort experienced at the end of the episode,
              a finding referred to as the `peak/end` effect.  The duration of the activity
              has little effect on retrospectively reported disutility.  A paradoxical
              consequence of this finding is that an activity can be made less aversive
              simply by adding a period of diminishing discomfort to what would have been the
              end of the experience.  The current research involves the conduct of an
              extensive series of experiments to further explore and gain additional insights
              into this phenomenon.
