Abstract    :
              9631371  Dilcher  A collection of over 100,000 fossil plants is housed at the
              Florida Museum of Natural History. This collection was originally organized by
              the PI, David Dilcher, and his students and colleagues. It was added to by
              regular collections made from the Eocene plant-bearing areas in western
              Tennessee and Kentucky, the coal mines in Indiana and Cretaceous clays in
              Kansas and Nebraska. Major contributions were made by co-PI Steven Manchester
              for his research on the Eocene and Paleocene fossil plants from western states.
              In addition to its areas of concentration, the collection now includes fossil
              plants from all over the world and many sites in the USA. This collection has
              become a major resource in the world and is visited regularly by people
              studying fossil plants from USA and other countries. Currently, there is no
              collection manager, and the collection is not well organized.  This project is
              a three year program to fund a Collection Manager position and provide some
              student assistance to catalogue and organize the specimens. When this
              collection is properly curated, it will be a national resource accessible and
              useful to the scientific community. The University of Florida is partnering
              with NSF to support this collection by maintaining the Collection Manager as a
              permanent position after the expiration of the grant.
