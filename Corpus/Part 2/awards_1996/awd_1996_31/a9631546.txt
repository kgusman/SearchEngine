Abstract    :
                9631546  Krupitskaya    This Research Planning Grant focuses on doping of
              Aluminum Nitride(AlN), a material with  wide direct band gap (6.2 eV), and a
              promising material for the development of unique UV  optoelectronic, high
              temperature, high power, and negative electron affinity (such as flat  panel
              display emitters) devices.  In this project a preliminary investigation of 
              in-situ doping of AlN will be performed using a series of impurities, which are
               theoretically shallow dopants, incorporated into epitaxial AlN thin films. 
              Initial  experiments will study Mg as an acceptor and Si as a donor impurity. 
              Under conditions of  strong self-compensation with native defects, other
              techniques such as temperature  annealing in different ambients and the use of
              other impurity species will be considered.  The properties of the doped AlN
              semiconductors will be investigated using electrical and  optical measurement
              techniques, X-ray diffraction, High Resolution Transmission Electron 
              Diffraction (HTEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force
              Microscopy (AFM)  an  d Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Further
              characterization and analysis will assess  the influence of impurities on
              electrical and structural properties of AlN films.  %%%  While this project
              will focus primarily on the study of controlled conductivity in a  potentially
              advantageous optoelectronic material, aluminum nitride, it will also be of 
              general benefit to similar properties and desirable features of group III
              nitrides, and  will contribute to a greater understanding of materials issues
              for these semiconductors.   The planning grant will aid the PI in accomplishing
              enough   preliminary work to show the promise of ideas or to modify    them
              based on the data acquired. Thus, support during the       planning period will
              aid the PI in preparing a more                   competitive full proposal.
