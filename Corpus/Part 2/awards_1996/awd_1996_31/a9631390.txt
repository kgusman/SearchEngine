Abstract    :
              9631390  Chory    An understanding of the signal transduction pathways
              controlling light-regulated development of Arabidopsis, with particular
              emphasis placed on the pathway defined by the negative regulatory gene, DET1,
              is the major goal of this research. DET1 was cloned and shown to be a novel
              nuclear protein that does not appear to bind DNA directly. The precise
              mechanism of action of DET1 in repressing expression of light-regulated
              promoters will be investigated and targets of DET1 action will be identified
              and cloned. Specifically, the biochemical function of DET1 will be determined,
              proteins that functionally interact with DET1 will be identified, any
              post-translationally modification of DET1 by light or other signals will be
              determined, DET3, a downstream response gene, will be isolated and
              characterized and the genetic analysis of suppressors of weak det1 alleles will
              be genetically analyzed. The data from these experiments will allow
              construction of mechanistic models for the control of development and gene
              expression by light and other signals in Arabidopsis thaliana.  %%%  Light
              signals are required for the induction and regulation of many developmental
              processes. Genetic analysis demonstrates that light responses are not simply
              endpoints of linear signal transduction pathways, but are the result of the
              integration of a variety of input signals through a complex network of
              interacting signaling components. The experiments described will integrate
              genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches in Arabidopsis in an effort to
              understand the mechanisms involved in plant response to light. Such an
              understanding in the model plant should form a conceptual framework for how all
              land plants respond to changes in their environment.  ***
