Abstract    :
              9631011  Anderson    This research involves an in-depth analysis of public
              opinion during the 1996 Nicaraguan national election.  In the last Nicaraguan
              election of 1990 voters defeated the socialist Sandinista incumbent who had
              governed the nation since the 1979 revolution and installed Violeta Chamorro
              and UNO, an administration committed to a capitalist, democratic regime. 
              Analysis of survey data from 1990 demonstrates that voters based their decision
              not only on concerns present in established , democratic elections, such as the
              candidates, the economy, and the issues - but also on an assessment of the
              governing legitimacy of the Sandinista regime.  the continuing instability and
              polarization  of Nicaraguan politics in the 1990s, much of which surrounds the
              creation of a new Constitution, indicates that the 1996 election may also focus
              upon questions of regime legitimacy as well as on candidates, the economy, and
              specific issues.  The upcoming election thus offers a chance for extensive
              examination of vote choice in a transitional democracy where regime legitimacy
              has already proven to be a significant electoral issue in deposing an
              entrenched government.  The election also offers an intriguing opportunity to
              contrast voters' concerns about the legitimacy of a capitalist democratic
              regime in 1996 with the types of concerns raised with respect to a socialist
              democratic regime in 1990.  The research  pursues this broad contrast and
              numerous more specific concerns by collecting new public opinion data prior to
              and immediately following the 1996 election and comparing its results with the
              1990 data.    At a broader and more comparative level, the findings of the
              project point toward critical questions that will prevail in comparative
              politics over the next generation of research:  Do voters judge and interpret
              regime legitimacy and the role of the state differently in capitalist versus
              socialist democracy?  What concerns predominate in new post-socialist
              democracies and in new post-authoritaria n democracies and how do these compare
              with concerns in established democracies?  In its transition process and in the
              contrast between 1996 and 1990 Nicaragua offers one of the first opportunities
              to study the electoral dynamics that may define politics in other new
              democracies over the next decade.  ***
