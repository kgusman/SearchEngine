Abstract    :
              The purpose of  this project is to improve our understanding of investment
              behavior by documenting and explaining the reallocation of physical capital
              across economic sectors.  The project will address issues such as:  How
              specific is capital to a particular firm or economic sector? How costly is it
              to move physical capital from one use to another? and How might such investment
              behavior influence the business cycle?  A new data set on the sale of
              individual items of equipment will be created and analyzed. These data will be
              used to study the cross-industry flow of used capital and the economic
              depreciation resulting from such flows.  How economic depreciation rates depend
              on whether capital stays within an industry or flows across industries will
              analyzed in order to quantify the specificity of capital.  Preliminary work
              suggests that capital loses much of its value when it is moved across
              industries.  In addition, the gross flows of capital using firm-level
              accounting data will be analyzed.  These data will be used to analyze the
              relationship between gross additions and gross subtractions to firms' capital. 
              These data will also be used to estimate the length of time taken by firms to
              decide to discontinue operations. These decision lags might be quantitatively
              important.  Indeed, the decision lag owing to uncertainty could be longer than
              the lag in selling and reinstalling the capital once the decision has been
              made.   Finally, a general equilibrium simulation model will be used to analyze
              the aggregate effects of allocative shocks under costly capital mobility.  The
              specification and parameterization of this model will derive from the empirical
              findings of this research.  This model will help quantify the role of capital
              reallocation in the business cycle.  Given the potentially high costs and long
              lags for reallocating  capital, the business-cycle effects may be substantial.
