Abstract    :
              Pace  9617026  In 1985 the Institute of Ecosystem Studies inaugurated a series
              of "Cary Conferences" with sponsorship by the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable
              Trust. These conferences which have all focused on discussion and examination
              of fundamental issues in ecology have been attended by over 350 scientists from
              20 countries.  This award will assist in the support of the seventh Cary
              Conference to be held in May 1997, which will focus on ecosystem science by
              identifying and characterizing past successes, evaluating limitations and
              exploring frontiers.  Successes are defined as bodies of work that have 1)
              advanced our scientific understanding of ecosystem structure and function, and
              2) provided insight and solutions to environmental problems. The conference
              will focus on current conceptual limitations and how these might be resolved.
              Limitations will also be critically addressed from the perspective of how
              ecosystem science can develop its scope for prediction and application. The
              frontiers of ecosystem science will be explored by examining important
              conceptual areas and the potential for the application of new approaches to
              standing problems.  A major thesis behind this analysis is that ecosystem
              science is unique in that many of the major advances in the field have been
              driven by the emergence of new environmental problems that could not be solved
              with existing approaches and techniques. Explicit recognition of the
              relationships between environmental problems and progress in ecosystem ecology
              may be very useful for determining the key factors that have led to successes
              in this field, highlighting what limits progress, and improving ability to
              predict and address frontier topics.  A conference volume will provide an
              evaluation of the state of ecosystem research and should be of wide interest to
              practitioners, new students entering, the field, and other ecologists curious
              about contemporary ecosystem research.  A more general interest brochure and/or
              electronic media and web page will demonstrate t he strength and values of
              ecosystem ecology to a broader audience, including scientists from other
              disciplines, environmental managers, and scientific funding agency personnel.
