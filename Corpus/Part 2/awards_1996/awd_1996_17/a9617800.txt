Abstract    :
              Pavlowsky  This research project will investigate the geochemical and geomorphic
              processes that determine the spatial variability of the sedimentation of metal
              contaminants in a floodplain.  The study area is the Blue River watershed of
              the Upper Mississippi valley zinc and led mining district (Wisconsin).  The
              study area affords the research benefits of a relatively simple physical
              landscape and a concentrated period of metal contamination (1900-1920). The
              research design calls for 1,310 samples to be taken from 5 cross-sections, 4
              point bars, and several active-channel locations selected strategically
              according to geomorphological criteria.  The stratigraphy and geochemistry of
              the floodplain deposits will be mapped, and the sediment-metal associations
              will be identified.  The results will be used to calibrate watershed-scale
              models of contaminant dispersal and to identify specific floodplain locations
              that have the highest potential for toxic effects or remobilization.   The
              research promises advances in two dimensions:  a clearer understanding of
              sediment residence time and in situ chemical alterations to floodplain
              contaminants;  and better predictions of the dispersal of metal contaminants
              from point sources to both proximal and distal floodplain sinks.  The combined
              longitudinal-lateral study addresses fundamental gaps in our understanding of
              toxic metal storage and remobilization in watersheds, and it should provide
              information important for future environmental management.
