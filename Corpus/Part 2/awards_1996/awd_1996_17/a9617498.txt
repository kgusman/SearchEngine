Abstract    :
              The measurement of G, the Newtonian constant of Gravitation,  is a long standing
              problem which continues to provide a  challenge to our scientific creativity. 
              Today's nearly 1%  discrepancy between the recent PTB (Physikalisch-Technische 
              Bundesanstalt) measurement and the `accepted` value of G is  of considerable
              interest to experimental physics and the  world of standards.  The fact that
              the PTB measurement  appears to be competently and thoughtfully done makes the 
              discrepancy even more intriguing.  A new free-fall approach (using g to measure
              G) will be  used.  In this experiment, an FG5 absolute gravimeter is to  be
              employed in connection with a movable 1200 lb. Tungsten  mass that surrounds
              the dropping chamber.  Little g is  measured when the surrounding mass is
              located above the  FG5's dropping region and then when it is located below the 
              dropping region.  The 80 micro-gal difference in these two  measurements
              together with the geometry of the surrounding  mass can be used to determine G.
               A preliminary (proof-of-  concept) experiment using a 200 lb. Mass has already
              been  carried out.  This follow-on experiment is expected to  result in an
              accuracy for G of better than 5 parts in  10,000.
