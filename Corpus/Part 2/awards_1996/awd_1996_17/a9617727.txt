Abstract    :
              The General Social Survey (GSS) is a national data program for the social
              sciences that charts social indicators and provides scientific data for
              analysis by literally thousands of students and researchers.  Since 1972 the
              GSS has conducted 19 independent cross-sectional surveys of the adult household
              population of the United States.  In 1994 and 1996, the GSS employed a
              scientifically ambitious and cost-effective biennial double-sample design that
              essentially administered two surveys simultaneously in alternate years. This
              design will be continued under the present grant, with pairs of surveys in 1998
              and 2000.    The General Social Survey has three fundamental aims.  First, it
              gathers and disseminates data on contemporary American Society.  These data
              allow social scientists to monitor and explain trends and constants in
              attitudes, behaviors, and social attributes of individuals and families. They
              also permit scientists to examine the structure and functioning of society in
              general as well as the roles played by various sub-groups.  Second, because
              other nations have emulated the GSS in their own surveys, the GSS permits
              social scientists to contrast the United States with other societies in order
              to place American society in comparative perspective and develop cross-national
              models of human society.  Third, the GSS makes high quality data easily
              accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others with minimal cost
              and waiting.    The GSS is divided into six components: 1) the replicating core
              of items, 2) topical modules, 3) cross-national modules, 4) mini-modules and
              supplements, 5) experiments in survey methodology, and 6) reinterviews and
              follow-up studies. The GSS is open to submissions of items from any of the
              social sciences, and a Board of Overseers, composed of expert survey
              methodologists and survey researchers, works with the principal investigators
              to select the most scientifically valuable items and modules for inclusion in
              each interview schedule.    The General Social Su rvey is a primary source of
              data for many branches of social science, second only to the US census in
              frequency of use by sociologists.  More than 3,000 publications and scientific
              reports have been based on the GSS, and articles employing the GSS continue to
              be published in central social-science journals at a rapid rate. Directly or
              indirectly, policy-makers rely upon the GSS as an unbiased source of
              information about the changing nature of American society. The present grant
              will continue this important scientific tradition into the twenty-first
              century.  23
