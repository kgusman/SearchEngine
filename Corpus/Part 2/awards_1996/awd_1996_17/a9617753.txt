Abstract    :
                   Bronk       9617753                            Mass spectroscopy is a
              highly sophisticated tool which has  contributed greatly to our knowledge of
              elemental flows and  biological rate processes in the ocean. This award will
              allow the  acquisition of a Europa 20/20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer with 
              an ANCAautosampler to analyze 15N and 13C enrichments in samples  from aquatic
              and marine systems. It will be housed in the  laboratory of Dr. Deborah Bronk
              at the University of Georgia's  Department of Marine Sciences; she will oversee
              its maintenance,  and supervise and coordinate the processing of samples. This 
              instrument will serve as a valuable resource for other researchers  at the
              University of Georgia, the Marine Institute on Sapelo  Island, and the Skidaway
              Institute of Oceanography. Faculty and  researchers at these institutions have
              research projects in a  number of different areas which desperately need or
              would benefit  from access to the mass spectrometer. These projects include 
              studies on the relationship between inorganic and organic nitrogen  uptake,
              contrasting the composition and utilization of dissolved  organic nitrogen at
              two Land Margin Ecosystem Research sites in  Chesapeake Bay and two coastal
              rivers of Georgia, refining  estimates of new and regenerated phytoplankton
              production in the  Ross Sea  as part of U.S. JGOFS, defining the nitrogen and
              carbon  content of riverine dissolved organic matter and the transport and 
              chemical transformations of this material as it moves to the  coastal zone,
              developing methods to quantify fungal productivity  with 13C tracers,
              determining rates of denitrification and benthic  photosynthesis, and defining
              nitrogen budgets on the Southeastern  continental shelf. This instrument will
              also be used in a  semiannual course under development at the University of
              Georgia  on tracer theories and stable isotope techniques. The University  of
              Georgia is providing an equal match to the federal support.
