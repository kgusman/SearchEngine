Abstract    :
              9617318  Rasmussen        During the Springs of 1994 and  95, a field program
              entitled the Verification  of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment
              (VORTEX) was executed by a  combination of NSF and National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administrations  sponsored scientists.  The primary objective of
              VORTEX was to evaluate several  hypotheses pertaining to low-level mesocyclone
              intensification, and tornado  formation, maintenance, and demise.  The
              observations collected include  ground-based (mobile and stationary) and
              airborne Doppler radars, mobile surface  and balloon borne meteorological
              instruments.         Eight of the VORTEX cases are of primary interest in the
              investigations  supported under this award.  First, several cases of
              tornadogenesis will be examined.   The Dimmitt and Friona, TX, tornadic cases
              of 2 June 1995 were particularly well  sampled by the suite of VORTEX sensors. 
              Observations made near the Hanston,  KS tornado (16 May 1995), Kellerville and
              Allison, TX (8 June, 1995), and Temple,  OK (17 April 1995) also will be
              analyzed.  These cases span a large variety of  tornadoes, from a brief, weak
              tornado in an unexpected location to one of the most  severe tornadoes ever
              observed (in terms of the combination of damage path width  and intensity).  In
              order to begin to adequately evaluate hypotheses concerning  tornadogenesis and
              low-level mesocyclone intensification, the Principal Investigators  will
              compare the tornadic cases described above with several well-sample non- 
              tornadic supercells.         All of these storms will be studied using a
              combination of airborne Doppler  radar, the newly developed "Doppler-on-Wheels"
              (DOW), mobile mesonetwork,  upper air soundings, and stereo photogrammetric
              cloud mapping.  The synthesis of  all of these data sources is considered vital
              to any comprehensive understanding of  the dynamics of the processes being
              investigated.        The proposed work is of vital importance to progress in
              understanding  supercell dynamics and issues of t ornado formation and demise. 
              If proposed  hypothesis regarding tornadogenesis are verified, then it is
              possible that a new radar  tornado signature could be developed with the
              potential of significantly reducing  false alarms and increasing the
              probability of detection of tornadoes.   ***
