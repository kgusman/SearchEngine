Abstract    :
              9619746  RALEIGH    This project will support shipboard scientific support
              equipment    for the research vessel MOANA WAVE a Navy-owned ship operated by 
              the University of Hawaii and dedicated to use in support of ocean  science
              research.      The Ship`oard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
              funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct  of
              ocean science research. This Program provides support for such  items as deck
              equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Barry C. Raleigh is fully qualified
              to direct  this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the 
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.      This project will
              allow the institution to acquire an oily water  separator, a reverse osmosis
              water maker membrane care unit and an  oil containment boom and to repair the
              overhead in the ship's  laboratory.  ***
