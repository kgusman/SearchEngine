Abstract    :
                  Acoustic and physical data collected in the Arctic since 1990 indicates a
              strengthening in the front between Atlantic/Pacific waters from near the
              Lomonosov Ridge toward the Alpha/Mendeleyev Ridge when compared with data from
              the 1970's and 1980's. Despite the key role Arctic processes play in global
              climate change our knowledge of  Arctic water mass structure is still based on
              sparsely sampled measurements. The SCICEX program offers the scientific
              community the unique and unprecedented opportunity to use simple under ice,
              submarine launched, expendable CTD (U/I SSXCTD) measurements to nearly double
              the number of high quality transarctic oceanographic survey sections.
              Complementing the submarine CTD data contribution to understanding Arctic
              circulation are acoustic measurements of ocean temperature, salinity and ice
              roughness which offer the capability to synoptically detect majop ocean
              circulation shifts. The Arctic Climate Observations using Underwater Sound
              (ACOUS) program will begin recording year round ocean temperature changes, and
              sea ice thickness and extent, along fixed acoustic paths in 1997.  Submarine
              sampling provides accurate local measurements of temperature, salinity and ice
              cover, whereas the advantage of basin scale acoustic measurements is synoptic
              observation of the basin integrated circulation effects. The Transarctic
              Acoustic Propagation (TAP) experiment demonstrated the feasibility of acoustics
              as a tool to monitor major movements of fronts.    The scientific objectives of
              using submarine CTD and ice profile data from SCICEX-97 are to:    (1) 
              establish an historical record of temperature and salinity from the Beaufort
              Sea to the Barents Sea to monitor global circulation changes and validate
              Arctic Ocean circulation models,    (2)  use the measured data to 'tune' the
              ACOUS acoustic thermometer, and    (3)  provide temperature, salinity and ice
              draft measurements concurrent with acoustic emissions.
