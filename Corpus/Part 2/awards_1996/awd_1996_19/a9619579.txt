Abstract    :
              9619579  Pollack          This is the first-year of a three continuing award.
              Research on planning within AI has led to  the development of computational
              techniques for generating a plan to achieve a specified goal from a  specified
              initial state, given definitions of the available actions.  Until recently,
              however, much  of this research has been governed by a number of simplifying
              assumptions, notably that  there is no indeterminacy either in the planning
              agent's knowledge, in the effects of its  actions, or in the notion of goal
              satisfaction, and that there are no changes either in the  goals presented to
              the agent or in its environment. This award supports research aimed at 
              relaxing the latter assumption.  Specifically, the research investigates the
              issues involved in  extending planning technology to a dynamic setting, in
              which the agent's goals and environment  are both subject to change.  A study
              is being made of both the theoretical and practical issues  presented by
              situations that call for integrated generation, maintenance, and execution of
              plans  for multiple, changing goals.  The project addresses these issues from
              two complementary points  of view.  The first is designing and implementing a
              dynamic planning system that is flexible  enough to allow for the experimental
              investigation of the consequences of adopting different  reasoning strategies
              in different dynamic planning environments.  Secondly, but in parallel, a 
              formal analysis is being carried out of the dynamic planning problem, with a
              special emphasis on  providing a clean semantic analysis of the implemented
              system.  The  aim of the project is more  flexible and realistic planning
              models and systems.
