Abstract    :
              9619984  Covert    This project focuqes on the hygroscopic properties of marine
              aerosol particles in order to understand and to determine the physical, optical
              and cloud nucleating properties of marine boundary layer aerosol particles. 
              The hygroscopic properties of aerosol are related to atmospheric relative
              humidity  f(RH) .  These properties are key factors that influence the spatial
              and temporal variability of the aerosol physical and optical properties during
              transport.   The project is part of the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment (ACE-2) which will be conducted in June and July,
              1997, over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic Ocean as an international
              collaborative effort.  The main objectives of ACE-2 are to study the properties
              of atmospheric aerosols that are relevant to radiative forcing and climate
              change using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements.  The
              measurements will involve use of a tandem differential mobility analyzer
              (RH-TDMA) that is capable of measuring the hygroscopic growth properties of
              marine boundary layer aerosol particles.  The PI will compare the hygroscopic
              behavior of ambient particles with those of synthetic aerosol prepared in the
              laboratory and having chemical compositions of artificial seawater, aerosol
              derived from sea water solutions, internal mixtures of acid sulfate and seasalt
              and internal mixtures of acid sulfate, nitrate and organic acids.  The
              laboratory studies will be used to interpret the growth of marine boundary
              layer aerosols and anthropogenic aerosols measured during the large-scale ACE-2
              field experiment.   The project will develop information needed to evaluate
              with what certainty light scattering and numbers of cloud condensation nuclei
              can be predicted from measurements of particle size distributions and
              hygroscopicity in the marine boundary layer.  Improving the linkage between
              aerosol physical and optical properties is a necessary step for quantifying the
              direct and indirect radiative effects  of a erosol particles within the
              atmosphere.            ATM-9619984
