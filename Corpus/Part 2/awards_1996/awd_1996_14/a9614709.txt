              During the 1995-96 Austral summer field season the oldest known  fossil
              crayfish and one of the oldest known occurrences of fossil  crayfish burrows
              were found in the Shackleton Glacier area of  Antarctica.  This award supports
              a collaborative,  interdisciplinary study to expand on these discoveries.  The 
              crayfish claw was found in the Upper Carboniferous to Lower  Permian Pagoda
              Formation deposited in glacial environments 280 to  300 million years ago; the
              discovery pushes back the first  occurrence of crayfish 65 to 75 million years.
               The crayfish  burrows were found in the Lower Triassic Fremouw Formation 
              deposited approximately 240 million years ago.  Their abundance  and complexity
              indicate that crayfish developed burrowing  behavior early in their long
              history.    The objectives of the study are to collect additional crayfish 
              body and trace fossils from Antarctica, to use these fossils to  develop
              further insight into the depositional conditions in parts  of that continent
              during intervals of the Late Carboniferous-  Early Permian and the Early
              Triassic, and to study the early  evolutionary and burrowing history of
              freshwater astacoid  decapods (crayfish).  Specifically, the work plan is: 1)
              to  search for more fossil crayfish and crayfish burrows in the  Pagoda
              Formation; 2) to interpret the way of life of the crayfish  in the Pagoda
              Formation and relate it to the crayfish morphology;  3) to reconstruct the
              depositional environment and paleoclimate  recorded by the crayfish-bearing
              rocks; 4) to search for crayfish  within burrows in the Fremouw Formation; 5)
              to quantitatively  describe the burrows in the Fremouw Formation; and 6) to
              compare  the morphology and behavior of Late Carboniferous to Early  Permian
              crayfish and burrows to those of the Early Triassic and  later.    This study
              will elucidate the evolutionary and behavioral history  of crayfish.  Modern
              crayfish exert an important control on  paramet ers such as energy flow, biotic
              species composition, and  biotic abundance in many different aquatic
              ecosystems.  This  proposed study will yield information about how and when
              this  environmental and behavioral diversification took place, as well  as
              increase understanding of the late Paleozoic and early  Mesozoic paleoclimates.
