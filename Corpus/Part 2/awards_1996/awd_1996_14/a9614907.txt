              ABSTRACT    OPP-9614927     OPP-9614907  ALLEY, RICHARD    FAWCETT, PETER 
              PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY      This research
              project uses a mesoscale climate model in conjunction with a General
              Circulation Model (GCM) to examine the cause of two extremely rapid coolings
              that have been found in paleoclimate records of the Northern Hemisphere. Those
              coolings cannot be explained by the same mechanisms that account for the major
              glacial episodes and represent an important clue to the way that climate change
              occurs. The modeling effort will be validated using the paleoclimate record
              recovered recently from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two ice cores taken
              near the summit of the Greenland ice cap. The results of this study will
              enhance the knowledge of climate system feedback mechanisms that could produce
              a rapid, dramatic shift in Northern Hemisphere temperatures and a drop in
              global sealevel that would affect human activities around the world.
