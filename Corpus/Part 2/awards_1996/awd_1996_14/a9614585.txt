Abstract    :
              9614585  Ku     Late Quaternary paleoenvironmental records contain information
              on the natural variability of Earth's past environments and climate.  These
              data are valuable for understanding mechanisms of past and present climate
              changes and for assessing the validity of climate-change predictions.  To gain
              a global understanding of the climate change process requires assembly and
              integration of regional and multidisciplinary evidence.  One important region
              deserves special attention is Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent areas.   Being
              the highest large plateau on Earth, Tibetan Plateau has a relatively recent
              geological history and has undergone significant uplift since the early
              Tertiary and into the Quaternary.  Located at mid-latitudes, it has a profound
              influence on global climates in that it acts like a "third pole", deflecting
              the Jet Stream Westerlies and influencing the position of the
              Siberian-Mongolian Highs and the inland penetration of the Indian and East
              Asian monsoons.  Drilled sediment cores obtained in recent years from the
              Plateau and adjacent regions by Chinese scientists provide a rare opportunity
              for studying the paleoenvironmental records in that part of the world.  As a
              U.S.-China collaborative project, the proposed research aims at extracting
              paleoclimate information in terms of wet/dry and warm/cold conditions recorded
              by two of the drill cores, one from Lake Tianshuihai (35(20'N, 79(30'E) located
              in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of 4836m, and the other
              core from Lake Juyanhai (42(10N, 100(05'E) near the northwest corner of Inner
              Mongolia at an altitude of 900m.  The cores will be age-dated using radiocarbon
              and uranium-series isotopes to establish their late Pleistocene chronologies up
              to about 230ka.   A multi-proxy approach will be carried out to decipher the
              lake-level and climate histories of the two regions, as well as with the
              paleoclimate record of the Loess Plateau in northern China.  The information
              gathered will contribute to the understanding   of the late Pleistocene
              climatic variations in mid-latitude continents and their possible link to the
              rapid climatic oscillations (Dansgaard-Oeschger events) observed in polar
              ice-cores, and of the influence of atmospheric circulation (involving winter
              and summer monsoons and westerlies) on paleoclimates of the western China.
