Abstract    :
              9614622  Voight  The Merapi volcano in Indonesia is currently undergoing an
              active phase that is characterized by growth of a lava dome. Previously, this
              stage of lava dome growth has been followed by a phase of instability and
              collapse that resulted in the generation of hazardous pyroclastic flows as
              exemplified in the recent (1994) lethal dome collapse.  The primary aim of this
              study is to shed light on the processes of dome growth and instability,
              fragmentation and pyroclastic flow transportation and deposition using the
              current cycle of activity at Merapi as a natural laboratory.  The research
              proposed will comprise the key US component to the cooperative international
              research program developed during the Merapi Decade Volcano International
              Workshop, held in Yogyakarta last October. The work plan involves looking at
              deformation of the lava dome and effusion rates with a network of geodetic
              survey stations and telemetered tiltmeters; positioning rain gauges that will
              test the impact of storm precipitation events on pyroclastic flow occurrences;
              and conducting stratigraphic and textural studies of the 1994 deposits to
              provide constraints on the interior of the previous dome.
