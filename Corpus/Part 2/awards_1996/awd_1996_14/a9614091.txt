Abstract    :
              9614091  RAIMONDI  Kelp forests, dominant features of subtidal temperate reefs
              worldwide, undergo relatively frequent and unpredictable local extinctions and
              recolonizations.  This project is a continuation of ongoing investigations of
              the causal mechanisms that allow for rapid forest recovery following widespread
              kelp loss. The objective of the project is to predict the frequency of
              occurrence and relative importance of the physical and biological conditions
              that promote extended spore dispersal in giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and
              determine: (1) the role of spore immigration rates in regulating the dynamics
              of local kelp populations and (2) the potential for limited dispersal to
              destabilize populations by reducing individual fitness. The research approach
              is to collect measurements of water motion simultaneously with measurements of
              spore release and dispersal from isolated plants over a wide range of physical
              and biological conditions.  This information will be used to build an
              individual-based model that will predict effective spore dispersal within and
              away from a local population for varying conditions of water motion, plant
              fecundity, plant spacing, spore release, and population size.  Predictions from
              the model will be tested using an experimental population of adult plants. The
              model will also be used to predict the frequency and spatial extent of
              self-fertilization under different conditions of water motion, plant fecundity,
              plant spacing, spore release, and population size. The effects of
              self-fertilization on individual fitness will be experimentally determined for
              all life stages. The information obtained from the project will apply generally
              to dispersal patterns of a large number of sessile marine organisms that
              release competent spores or larvae into nearshore waters. The general
              significance of this work is that it will provide much needed insight into the
              hydrodynamic conditions that promote extended propagule dispersal and the
              degree to which propagule immigration influenc es the dynamics of species
              perceived to have relatively closed populations. Additionally, the
              individual-based approach to this study will provide information on spore
              dispersal away from individual plants, which will be used to evaluate the costs
              of self-fertilization in giant kelp, a member of a dominant group of  temperate
              marine algae whose life history and dispersal characteristics place them at
              high risk to the adverse effects of self-fertilization.  ***
