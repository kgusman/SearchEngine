Abstract    :
              9614455  Hendee  This award supports travel for ten individuals to attend the 
              World Congress in Bioengineering and Medical Physics in  Nice, France in July,
              1997.  These individuals will be  responsible for identifying research
              frontiers in specific  areas of bioengineering, estimating future research 
              directions, and assessing how these frontiers and directions  are likely to be
              impacted by global information networking.  A report on these issues will be
              generated by the attendees  and furnished to the National Science Foundation. 
              This  report will serve also as a guide to planning the next World  Congress in
              Bioengineering and Medical Physics scheduled for  Chicago in the Year 2000. 
              Each of the Nice-meeting  attendees for whom travel support is requested are
              pivotal  members of the Steering Committee for the Year 2000 World  Congress,
              including the Congress co-presidents.    The report to be prepared by the
              travelers would find three  important uses: 1) NSF and other funding agencies
              would  receive a report about frontiers of research in the  classical areas of
              biomedical engineering supported by the  division of Bioengineering and
              Environmental Systems plus a  section that emphasizes how global information
              networking is  likely to impact on the discipline in the near future; 2)  the
              report would be placed on line on the home page for the  World Congress 2000
              and thus be available to all interested  parties; and, 3) the information would
              be a key factor in  planning the technical program for World Congress 2000.
