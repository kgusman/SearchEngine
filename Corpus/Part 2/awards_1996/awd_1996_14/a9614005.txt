Abstract    :
              9614005  SHAPIRO    In the relationship between phytoplankton and their
              associated bacteria, it is assumed that the bacteria derive nutrition from
              phytoplankton exudates, and that phytoplankton utilize the bacteria as a source
              of specific vitamins, a source of N or P, or as an alternate carbon source. 
              This SGER project hypothesizes  that a major role of this association relates
              to metal reduction and acquisition. Thus, the phycosphere will be examined as a
              symbiotic zone of active metal reduction by bacteria and uptake by
              phytoplankton.    As a first step in examining this hypothesis, the researchers
              will determine whether there are replicable assemblages of bacteria living in
              close association with phytoplankters, and whether these associations are
              capable of metal reduction.  During this SGER project phytoplankton clones from
              the Oregon coast will be established and will subsequently be tested with 16s
              rRNA probe analysis for common marine bacterial genera, including Shewanella
              putrefaciens, a common metal-reducing species.  Population   analysis of
              bacteria associated with phytoplankton natural samples, using DNA
              amplification, will permit the researchers to characterize bacteria associated
              with phytoplankton whether or not they are amenable to culturing techniques. 
              Natural samples will be probed with 16s rRNA probes generated from the
              amplified DNA.    The significance of this research lies in its potential to
              provide a mechanism, based on symbiosis, for metal uptake by phytoplankton. 
              This may prove critical in understanding those regions of the world's oceans
              where metal limitation of primary production is strongly suggested.  ***
