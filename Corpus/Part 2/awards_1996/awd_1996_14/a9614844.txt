Abstract    :
                 This project is a study of the effects of antarctic sea ice in the global
              climate system, through an examination of how the spatial distribution of ice
              and snow thickness and of open water is reflected in satellite-based synthetic
              aperture radar (SAR) imagery.  The field investigations will be carried out
              from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in winter 1998 and summer 1999, and will
              produce observations of the snow and ice distribution, the crystal structure,
              stable isotopes, salinity and temperature structure of ice cores, and the
              stratigraphy, grain size, and water content of the snow cover.   The SAR images
              from ERS-2 and RADARSAT will be acquired at the McMurdo ground station, and
              processed at the Alaska SAR Facility.  These will provide information about the
              large-scale ice motion field and the small-scale ice deformation field, both of
              which contribute to the observed ice thickness distribution.  In addition, a
              study of the spatial and temporal variation of the backscattered microwave
              energy will contribute to the development of numerical models that simulate the
              dynamic and thermodynamic interactions among the sea ice, ocean, and
              atmosphere.  The surface data is vital for the extraction of environmental
              information from the radar data, and for the ultimate validation of interactive
              models.
