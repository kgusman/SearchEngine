Abstract    :
              Castillo-Chavez  9600027    ABSTRACT    The 1996 SACNAS Mathematical Sciences
              Summer Institute (SMSSI) is a six-week  summer program at Cornell University
              organized in conjunction with the  Society for Advancement of  Chicanos and
              Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and the support of the  National Security
              Agency,  Cornell University's Provost Office and the  National Science
              Foundation. SMSSI will bring between 20  and 30 Chicano, Latino and Native
              American undergraduates to Cornell University  for an intensive six-week summer
              program in mathematical biology.  The 1996  SMSSI  will take place between June
              17 - July 26, 1996.  Participants will receive  round-trip transportation to
              Ithaca, NY, room and board, and a $2000 stipend.  The program is designed for
              undergraduates who will complete their sophomore or  junior year during 1996.
              Students majoring in mathematics, biology, or related  fields and who have had
              a year of calculus, are eligible to apply. The academic  content of the 1996
              Institute has been designed by Principal Investigator  Professor
              Castillo-Chavez, a leading mathematical biologist at Cornell  University and a
              member of the Board of Directors of the Society for  Mathematical Biology.
              Emphasis will be placed on studying the mathematical  theory of population
              dynamics and its applications to demography, ecology,  epidemiology, and
              evolutionary biology. The SMSSI will include dynamical systems   and stochastic
              processes seminars, a writing seminar intimately  connected to the study of
              theoretical biology, analysis and numerical  simulations of mathematical models
              associated with group research projects,  workshops on applying for admissions
              and funding for graduate school, and  colloquia given by invited mathematicians
              and scientists. Applications may also  be requested from the SACNAS office by
              phone: 408-459-4272 or e-mail:  sacnas@cats.ucsc.edu.  Additional information
              about the program may be obtained  by contacting Herbert A. Medina by phone at
