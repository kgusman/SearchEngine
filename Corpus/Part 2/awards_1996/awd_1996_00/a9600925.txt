Abstract    :
              9600925  Haddy  The primary research goal is to characterize the oxidation state
              changes of the manganese cluster of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of higher
              plants in terms of energetics.  This will be carried out by monitoring two
              electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals, a multiline signal at g=2 and a
              broad signal at g=4, associated with one of the oxidation states, S2.  In
              addition, the presence of an even spin EPR signal at g=4.8 associated with S1,
              the state preceding S2, will be confirmed using parallel mode detection and
              subsequently used to monitor S1.  The specific research objectives include: 
              confirmation that the state associated with the S2 signal at g=4 (designated
              S2-g=4) precedes the state associated with the S2 multiline signal (S2-mult);
              determination of the activation energy barriers between the states associated
              with S1 and S2-g=4, S2-g=4 and S2-mult, and S2-mult and S3, the state that
              follows S2; determination of the relative free energies of the states
              associated with S1, S2-g=4, and S2-mult; and investigation of the energy
              barriers and relative free energies in the presence of the inhibitor ammonia. 
              To achieve these objectives, the magnitudes of the S2 signals and if present
              the S1 signal will be measured in a series of equilibrium and kinetics
              experiments performed over a range of illumination temperatures.  The
              magnitudes will be related to the population in each state.  The educational
              activities proposed are in accord with the Chemistry Department's current plans
              to develop a concentration or major in biochemistry.  The education objectives
              include the development of:  a one-semester biochemistry laboratory course; a
              series of lectures on biophysical topics to be given as part of the second
              semester introductory course; and a set of EPR experiments for use in
              undergraduate laboratories.  The EPR experiments for undergraduates will
              include some that have applications in biochemistry and are not presently
              available in the chemical education literature.   %%%
