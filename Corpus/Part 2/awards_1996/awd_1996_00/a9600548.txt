Abstract    :
                        INT-9600548  Ciesielski    This U.S.-Polish Cooperative Researah award
              is to research "Problems in Set Theoretic Analysis."  The principal researchers
              are Dr. Krzysztof Ciesielski and Dr. Jerzy Wojciechowski of West Virginia
              University and Dr. Tomasz Natkaniec and two other colleagues of the Pedagogical
              University in Bydgoszcz, Poland.  The researchers work in the newly created
              area of Set Theoretic Analysis.  This is a branch of Real Analysis, the
              theoretic foundation of Calculus, that is characterized by extensive use of
              modern set-theoretic techniques.  The objectives of the project are to further
              understanding of the basic properties of such a fundamental concept in the
              whole of mathematics as the notion of a real function.  New developments in Set
              Theory will provide the necessary tools to make the realization of this
              objective possible.  In addition to the senior personnel, the project involves
              five graduate students (two of whom are women).  Their involvement in an
              international activity, at this early stage of their careers, will be of great
              importance for them and will likely lead to broader international cooperation
              in the future.      This research in mathematics fulfills the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to
              combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.    ***  ??
