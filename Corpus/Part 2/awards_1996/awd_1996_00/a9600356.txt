Abstract    :
              9600356  Wolf      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a seven-month
              postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Marty Wolf of Mankato State
               University to work with Dr. Brendan McKay at the Australian  National
              University in Canberra, Australia.        The topic of this research is to
              establish the complexity of  p-partite tournament isomorphism.  The primary
              goal is to  determine a tighter analysis of the complexity of this open 
              problem in graph theory.  There is an interest in studying  this complexity on
              a variety of combinatorial objects  because it will help develop a deeper
              understanding of what  makes the isomorphism problem difficult and the relative
               complexity of combinatorial objects.  This project is also  significant
              because some problems found in neural network  algorithms result in networks
              where the underlying structure  is a p-partite tournament, and Dr. Wolf and Dr.
              McKay will  explore the application of convex subsets to try and  overcome
              these problems.  ***
