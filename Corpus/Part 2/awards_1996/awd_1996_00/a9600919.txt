Abstract    :
              INT 9600919  Buss      This U.S.-Czech research effort headed by Samuel R. Buss
              of the University of California-San Diego, and Pavel Pudlak at the Mathematics
              Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, will examine several closely
              related areas of mathematical logic and computational complexity theory.  These
              areas include: bounded arithmetic; complexity of propositional proof systems;
              circuit complexity and communication complexity; and cryptography.    The U.S.
              team, consisting of Buss, Russell Impagliazzo of the University of
              California-San Diego, Toniann Titassi of the University of Pittsburgh, and
              Steven Rudich of Carnegie Mellon University, will work together with three
              Czech partners at the Mathematics Institute on deeply connected, fundamental
              open mathematical problems.  The Czech team consists of Pudlak, Jiri Sgall and
              Jan Krajicek.  There are three specific problems this international team will
              investigate: 1) finite axiomatizability of bounded arithmetic, 2) bounds on the
              length of Frege and extended Frege proofs, and 3) lower bounds for the depth
              and the size of Boolean circuits.  Results are expected to yield foundational
              research that will serve as the basis for devising practical protocols in the
              future, with potential application to cryptography.    This project in
              mathematical foundations fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe
              to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual
              interest and competence.    ??
