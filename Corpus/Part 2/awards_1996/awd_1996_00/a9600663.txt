Abstract    :
              9600663  Herrick  A phylogenetic survey across a spectrum of ciliates will
              monitor the genesis and molecular evolution of the processing of the 81 locus
              of Oxytricha fallax. The 81 locus is of particular interest because it has been
              shown that during the development of the somatic macronucleus it is processed
              to form three overlapping macronuclear chromosomes. The phylogenetic survey
              will be done with degenerate-primer PCR of macronuclear intervals
              representative of alternative processing in the DNAs of ever more distantly
              related ciliates. The amplified DNAs will be sequenced and analyzed for
              molecular and relational insights as well as determining the design of further
              degenerate PCR primers to permit detection of more distantly related sequences.
               %%%  Ciliates process their germline nucleus to produce a somatic nucleus by
              eliminating specific DNA sequences in a programmed fashion. One particular
              locus, the 81 locus of Oxytricha falfax, has been shown to be unusual in that
              it is alternatively processed to produce three overlapping fragments with a
              total of three open reading frames. This study will use this region for a
              comparison of the involved sequence in DNA from related hypotrichous ciliated
              protozoa in the hope of understanding the evolution of programmed gene
              rearrangements. Such programmed DNA rearrangements are observed in immune-cell
              gene rearrangements and stochastic rearrangements during tumorigenesis in
              mammals and insight into the evolution of the process in these simple protozoa
              can provide a basis of understanding of the process in more complex organisms.
