Abstract    :
              9600047  Roselli      Steroid hormones are integral modulators of neural
              communication  and development.  These simple molecules, acting as hormones,
              have  the potential to influence all neural functions from initiation of 
              neural development to the activity of individual synapses in  adults.  Recent
              advances in knowledge about non-genomic actions of  steroid hormones, the
              involvement of non-neuronal elements in  reproductive function and the role of
              steroid hormones on neural  organization, have had striking effects on
              neuroendocrine  physiology, neuronal cell biology, reproductive physiology and 
              non-reproductive behaviors such as learning and memory, aging,  aggression,
              feeding and emotion.  This action will provide support  for a Young
              Investigator Symposium to be held at the 1996 Workshop  on Steroid Hormones and
              Brain Function in Breckenridge, CO on March  30-April 3, 1996.  This workshop
              brings together scientists using  different approaches to address important and
              timely issues  concerning steroid hormone and growth factor involvement in
              brain  function.  Molecular biologists, neuroanatomists,  neurophysiologists
              and behavioral scientists will discuss issues  such as neurotrophic and
              neuroprotective effects of estrogen, the  neurobiology of androgenic anabolic
              steroids, functions of  G-protein linked steroid hormone receptors, and
              steroids and  reproductive behaviors.  These are fundamentally important 
              questions in a field that is rapidly changing and advancing.  The  inclusion of
              the Young Investigator Symposium will provide a  mechanism to foster young
              scientists and facilitate collaborative  efforts that may significant enhance
              our understanding of basic  neurobiological mechanisms.
