Abstract    :
                                  Funds are requested for a Molecular  Dynamics Storm 840,
              Power  Macintosh             7500, HP  LaserJet 4M plus, and 6 imaging 
              screens, to be placed in  the core facility             serving the three
              departments of Biology,  Molecular Biology  & Biochemistry, and            
              Chemistry.  The instrument  will be used  by  the  laboratories of  six major
              users, two             minor users, and other occasional users in these 
              departments.                    The  Storm 840  images  radioactive and 
              fluorescent blots and  gels with  five             orders of linear dynamic
              range, and a resolution  of 250 M for radioactive samples,             and 500
              M for fluorescent  samples.   This  instrument will  provide  the  ability  to 
                         accurately quantify radioactive and fluorescent  blots  and  gels, 
              which  is  not             currently  possible at  Wesleyan  University.  The 
              fluorescent  capability  will enable             the  use  of  fluorescent 
              labels  instead  of  radioactive labels  in many applications.            
              Substitution  of  chemifluorescent  techniques  for  chemiluminescent 
              techniques  will             provide both accurate quantitation of samples and 
              longer sample lifetime.                    The  Storm  imager  will  be  used 
              to  quantify  protein-DNA  and  protein-RNA             gel shifts, sequencing
              gels,  CAT  assays,  Western,  Northern,  and  Southwestern  blots,            
              RNA  footprints   and   toeprints,    pulse-chase  labeling  experiments, 
              processive   DNA             replication,  nucleotide  binding,  RNase 
              protection,  and  RT-PCR   assays.     These             methods  will  be 
              applied  to  several  different  projects.   These  include  studies   of:     
                     Contribution  of  individual  structural  elements   to   the   folding 
               of   RNA;             Thermodynamic  and  structural  basis of  RNA-  protein 
              interactions;    Dissection    of             Drosophila  Paired   proteil 
              function;  Identification  of   imm unoglobulin-like             molecules  in 
               he  developing  CNS;  Mechanisms  of   protein  localization  in  scherichia  
                        coli;  Identification  of  novel  antigens   for  Lyme   disease 
              diagnosis;   Biochemical             analysis  of  yeast  DNA  replication  and
               repair  proteins;  and  The   role  of extracellular             matrix and
              signaling molecules in teratocarcinoma  stem cell differentiation.             
                    Matching  funds  from  Wesleyan  University  will  pay  for  50%  of  the
                cost  of the             instrument.
