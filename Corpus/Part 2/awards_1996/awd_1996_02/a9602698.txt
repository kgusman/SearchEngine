Abstract    :
                Howard University, the only Historically Black College and University
              classified as a Group I Research Institution, is the recipient of ARI funds to
              renovate research and training space in Thirkield Hall.  Constructed in 1909,
              the building has the distinction of being one of the oldest structures on
              campus, and is home to the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  Faculty
              members are actively involved in ongoing research initiatives that emphasizes
              atmospheric science, computational physics, condensed matter physics,
              magnetism, optical physics, remote sensing, spectroscopy, and theoretical
              physics.  However, existing conditions such as the lack of temperature and
              humidity controls, severely limit the ability of faculty and students to
              conduct competitive research.  Renovations will include the following: upgraded
              plumbing and provisions for power with filtered and isolated services for
              specialized instrumentation; installation of new cabinetry to make existing
              space more efficient to accommodate new equipment; installation of new fume
              hoods where required; and upgraded security measures for laboratories. This
              project will enhance the institution's goal of being the largest producer of
              African American physicists at the doctoral level. Improved facilities
              complement the Department's mission of striving for national and international
              excellence in research and teaching in physics and ensures that students of
              African American descent are given the opportunity to achieve their fullest
              potential in physics.
