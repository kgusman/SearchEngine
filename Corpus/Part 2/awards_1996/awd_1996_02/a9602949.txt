Abstract    :
              9602949  Vitousek/Neff    This Americas Program award will support dissertation 
              research by Jason Neff of Stanford University, under the  direction of Dr.
              Peter Vitousek.  This project, entitled  "Biogeochemical Controls on the Loss
              of Dissolved Organic  Nutrients from Tropical Ecosystems" will take place at
              two  sites, the Paragominas region of Eastern Brazil and at the  Tapajos Forest
              Reserve.        The goal of this project is to address mechanisms which 
              control the source and fate of dissolved organic phosphorus  (DOP) and
              dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in two tropical  forest soil types (Tapajos)
              and also soils from primary and  secondary forest at a second site
              (Paragominas) in Brazil.  The biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus
              in  tropical forests play key roles in both the global carbon  cycle and in the
              sustainability of agriculture following  land use change.  This research will
              improve our  understanding of these loss pathways, providing a basis from 
              which to evaluate their role in the development and  maintenance of fertility
              in natural and agricultural  ecosystems.      ***
