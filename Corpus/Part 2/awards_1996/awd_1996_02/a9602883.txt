Abstract    :
              Kennedy  9602883    Victor S. Kennedy for Graduate Student, William C. Walton   
              This dissertation enhancement award will support doctoral  candidate William C.
              Walton for three months while in  Australia to experimentally determine the
              effect of the  invasive, predatory green crab, Carcinus maenas, upon the 
              recovery of the Tasmanian doughboy scallop, Pecten fumatus,  fishery.  Mr.
              Walton will undertake his work at the  laboratories of Drs. Ronald Thresher and
              Chad Hewitt at the  Centre for Research on Introduced Marine Pests (CRIMP), 
              Division of Fisheries, Institute of Natural Resources and  Environment, Hobart,
              Tasmania. Mr. Walton is currently  undertaking similar research on the effect
              of the  nonindigenous C. maenas upon the bay scallop, Argopecten  irradians ,
              fishery in Massachusetts.  This unique  opportunity to integrate the two
              studies will test the  generality of impacts of the same invader upon different
               prey and may provide a valuable predictive tool to fishery  managers.  Mr.
              Walton will experimentally quantify the  importance of  green crab predation
              upon P. fumatus during  the summer by determining 1) overall predation losses 
              (predator exclusions), 2) green crab population dynamics  (field surveys), 3)
              predator-prey interactions (laboratory  feeding trials) , and green crab
              predation rates upon  scallops (predator enclosures).  Experimental
              quantification  of interactions, and the subsequent comparisons, are  essential
              for the broadening of our scope of ecological  reference.
