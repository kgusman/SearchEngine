Abstract    :
                Lewis and Clark College, a predominately undergraduate liberal arts college in
              Portland, Oregon, is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of BoDine
              Hall.  Constructed in 1946, BoDine Hall is home to the Department of Biology. 
              The current configuration of the aging facility does not readily support
              research programs in molecular biology, cell biology, population biology and
              botany.  Funds will be used to consolidate a group of laboratories into modern
              functional lab suites, creating two large laboratories that will serve three
              faculty members and their undergraduate research students.  Existing walls that
              separate spaces into smaller compartments will be removed to create open labs
              with common spaces and facilities.  A small tissue culture facility will be
              established, and an underused dark room will be remodeled to serve a shared
              equipment room.  In conjunction to the renovation effort, funds will be used to
              replace the Department's dilapidated greenhouse. By increasing opportunities
              for interaction among students and faculty, the renovated labs will foster an
              active and collegial research environment.  With the duplication of space and
              facilities being reduced, available research space will be efficiently
              utilized.  It is anticipated that a revitalized research environment will
              appeal to and entice more students to become active researchers, thus promoting
              the College's mission in science by ensuring that graduates are knowledgeable
              concerning the methods and ideas of modern science.
