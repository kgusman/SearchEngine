Abstract    :
              The Louisiana Systemic Improvement Program (LaSIP) proposes to capitalize on its
              first five years of NSF funding, by aligning recent reform projects with LaSIP
              goals and strategies.  New reform efforts include the Learn Commission, and a
              USDE Technology Challenge award.  LaSIP will use its position of strong
              influence in the stateOs educational framework to implement systemic reform
              strategies at the local district level, through the auspices of local Learn
              Commission funding and the networking capabilities operationalized by the
              Challenge award.    LaSIP will further its inroads into the stateOs reform of
              education by continuing and expanding its professional development
              opportunities for teachers and administrators; by providing guidance for local
              curriculum development; and by changing the way teacher education is structured
              in the state.  Local efforts will focus on leadership development among
              teachers; working with teams of teachers and administrators; and using
              professional societies and organizations as the bridge between state curriculum
              frameworks, and the development of local curricula.    The initiative will
              deploy its efforts through 8 Regional Partnership Initiatives, which will be
              determined through a competitive grant process, as well as the traditional and
              expanded professional development activities through a competitive grant
              process.  ***
