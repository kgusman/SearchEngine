Abstract    :
              9634142  Yeh  This action is to support a small reconnaissance team to learn 
              from the February 21, 1996 Peru earthquake and tsunami, in order  to gather and
              study perishable inundation data.    On February 21, 1996, a large earthquake
              struck under the sea off  the northern coastal region of Peru, triggering a
              tsunami which  swept into the port of Chimbote with 3 to 5 meter waves, 
              destroying fish processing plants and more than 50 houses, and  which was
              recorded by tide gages at Easter Island (60 cm) and  Hawaii (25 cm).  The
              information gathered to date point to it  being a "tsunami earthquake" -- a
              term resulting from the 1994  Nicaragua earthquake to indicate an earthquake
              which is unusually  efficient in producing tsunamis.  A thorough investigation
              of  "tsunami earthquakes" and their effects is critical in terms of  hazard
              mitigation, and valuable in light of recent theoretical  developments in fault
              rupture mechanisms.    The reconnaissance team will gather essential
              tsunami-effect  information including runup, flow patterns and velocities, 
              tide-gage records, structural damage, scouring effects, sediment  transport,
              intensity of ground shaking, the effect on estuaries  and nearby lakes, and any
              secondary effects caused by this  earthquake and its associated tsunami. The
              team will attempt to  follow the recommendations for survey methodology and
              procedures  established at the 1995 Tsunami Measurement Workshop in Estes 
              Park, Colorado, as well as the 1995 Tsunami modelling Workshop in  Friday
              Harbor, Washington.    Because international tsunami researchers are currently
              involved  in a reconnaissance of another large tsunamigenic earthquake (Mw 
              8.2) that occurred along the northern coast of Irian Jaya,  Indonesia, on
              February 17, 1996, this Peru tsunami reconnaissance  team will be relatively
              small.  However, the findings of this  team will be announced widely through
              the Tsunami Bulletin Board  -- an Internet mailing list initiated and
              maintained by the NOAA  Pacific Marine and Environmen tal Laboratory (PMEL) in
              Seattle.  Immediately after the survey, a brief report will be disseminated 
              via the Tsunami Bulletin Board, with the final results being  published, and
              also posted on the University of Washington World  Wide Web tsunami home page.
              All the gathered data will be  available upon request.  ***
