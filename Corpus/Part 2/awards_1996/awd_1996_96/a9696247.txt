Abstract    :
              95-11842    Edelman  Contemporary laws impose substantial responsibilities upon
              employers to adhere to and enforce government policies designed to protect
              civil rights and other aspects of the employer-employee relation.  Despite
              this, the laws regulating the employment relation tend to be broad and
              ambiguous, leaving organizations wide latitude to interpret and decide how to
              comply with them.  Previous research indicates that organizations respond to
              these laws by creating internal legal structures that serve as symbols of
              attention to law.  But research give few clues concerning a number of 
              important questions concerning how these structures shape the internal legal
              culture of their organizations or whether (how much?) they influence employees
              to assert their legal rights when they perceive them to be infringed or pacify
              employees by creating the impression that the employer must be obeying the law.
               Drawing on organization theory, this study is a broad investigation of the
              creation and characteristics of internal legal cultures within organizations
              and the extent to which laws designed to protect employees actually change
              organizational culture and affect the work lives of employees.  It is based on
              interviews with general, legal, and personnel administrative officials in six
              organizations and on a survey of 200 employees in each of these organizations. 
              At the intraorganizational level, it will investigate employees views of the
              realization of rights in organizations and of the likelihood of their opting
              for legal solutions to employment problems.  At the organization level, the
              study will elucidate officials' conceptions of law and enactment %%%%  The laws
