              "An Investigation of the Interaction Between Codes and Decoding Machines" 
              Oliver Collins    The essential concept of this research is to study decoding,
              itself, as a  communications problem. Electronics has advanced to the stage
              where many  chips, each containing tens or even hundreds of thousands of gates,
              can  advantageously be exchanged for a decrease in antenna aperture in a 
              satellite terminal or for a lower transmitter power in a remote buoy or 
              cellular telephone. These latter applications are well able to use  extremely
              powerful coding because of the asymmetry of cost in the two  directions of
              communication. In the case of cellular telephones, for  example, power savings
              are much more important in the link from the mobile  unit than in the link to
              the mobile unit. A sophisticated decoder in the  base station drawing power
              from the AC mains can save battery power in the  mobile transmitter. Similarly,
              a large scale environmental data collection  network need incorporate only
              simple and cheap encoders in the  transmitters; a single decoder in a satellite
              or ground station can service  all of these encoders. Unfortunately, exploiting
              even a small fraction of  the processing power of a single piece of silicon is
              hard, let alone that  of a module containing many chips. The difficulty is
              providing sufficient  internal communication among the different parts of the
              decoding machine.  Today, wiring connectivity rather than gate count limits the
              sophistication  of signal processing.  This research presents bounds on the
              amount of  information which has t o flow in and out of the different sections
              of a  decoding engine when it is partitioned into separate parts. At the
              moment,  these bounds are confined to the Viterbi decoding of shift register
              based  codes. This research will extend these bounds to other codes and
              decoding  algorithms and, more importantly, explore codes (both convolutional
              and  general finite state machine based) which allow decoding with minimum 
              information flow. The same techniques used in analyzing decoder information 
              flow will also be applied to other situations where partitioning is  important,
              e.g., very large circuit switches. Dissecting decoder  information flow may
              result in a new generation of codes of great practical  use and will certainly
              yield insights into the ultimate limits of the type  of codes in use today.
