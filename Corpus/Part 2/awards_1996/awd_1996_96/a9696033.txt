Abstract    :
                  9411564  Martinez    There is great interest by neuroscientists, and a
              tremendous  practical benefit, to understanding how the brain stores 
              information.  Previous research has suggested that memory  formation involves
              protein synthesis and new patterns of  neural gene expression.  In this
              research a model of  learning, long-term potentiation, will be examined in
              order  to probe the genes which may be switched on, or switched  off, when new
              memories are laid down in the brain.   Dr.  Martinez and his colleagues will
              identify changes in gene  expression induced in a region of the brain called
              the  hippocampus, using the technique of cDNA subtractive  hybridization. 
              These genes will then be cloned so that they  can be analyzed in detail through
              gene sequencing.    The identification of these memory-related genes should 
              increase our understanding of the cellular and genetic  factors which influence
              information storage in the nervous  system.  These studies should have
              important implications  for problems of learning, and of dealing with
              aging-related  changes in the brain.  ***
