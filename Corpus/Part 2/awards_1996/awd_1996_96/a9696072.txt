Abstract    :
              9411185  Gerken                                 ABSTRACT    This research
              examines infants' and children's sensitivity to two  potential cues for early
              language acquisition: prosody and function  morphemes. Prosodic changes such as
              pausing, pitch resetting and  syllable lengthening potentially cue the
              locations of linguistically  relevant units. Function morphemes such as
              articles and verb inflections  occur in grammatically specified contexts
              (e.g.,"the" occurs only in  NPs) and potentially allow learners to distinguish
              among phrase types.  One set of proposed experiments examines the effects of
              prosody and  function morphemes on 2-year-olds' sentence comprehension. Another
              set  uses sentence imitation with 2-year-olds and preferential listening with 
              9-month-olds to examine syntactic and discourse factors that might  influence
              learners' sensitivity to phonological phrases-prosodic units  that appear to
              govern some aspects of prosody in adult speakers.  ***
