Abstract    :
              The long-range goal of this project is to define the interactions              
              in the transcription complex that cause arrest and termination by              
              RNA polymerase II in higher eukaryotes.  Transcriptional arrest or             
              termination contributes to gene regulation in eukaryotes, but the              
              underlying mechanisms are unknown.  To understand these mechanisms,            
              a much better appreciation of the structure of RNA polymerase II               
              transcription elongation complexes, both at arrest sites where                 
              elongation normally is efficient, will be required.  Methods will              
              be developed to produce defined elongation complexes that contain              
              either pure RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase II that carries the            
              modifications and auxiliary factors it acquires during initiation              
              at a promoter.  Both types of defined elongation complexes will be             
              isolated and their structures probed using a variety of agents that            
              can reveal the configuration of RNA and DNA strands within them.               
              Experiments will be performed to test two models for                           
              transcriptional arrest; 1) that altered configuration of the                   
              transcript produces arrest and 2) that arrest is caused by bent, or            
              conformationally altered, DNA molecules.

              This study will produce new insight into how RNA polymerase                    
              transcribes the information in genes (DNA) to an RNA product which             
              is required to express genetic information.
