Abstract    :
              9629592  WHITE  One of the goals of systematic biology is to reconstruct the
              historical (phylogenetic) relationships among organisms.  A number of
              analytical methods have been devised that will produce phylogenetic
              reconstructions.  When identical sets of data obtained from organisms are
              evaluated by the different reconstruction methods, differing phylogenies
              sometimes result.  Because the true phylogenetic relationships of organisms in
              nature are not known, it is difficult to assess which of the different
              reconstructions best approximates their actual history.  In the laboratory,
              rapidly-changing organisms can be raised in which the true history of each
              lineage, and its characteristics, can be precisely known and manipulated. 
              Phylogenies reconstructed by the various analytical methods in use in
              systematic biology can be compared with the known history, and in this way the
              efficiency of each method in discovering the correct or true phylogeny can be
              evaluated.    In this study, Mary White will produce lineages of bacterial
              viruses, including Bacteriophage T7 and Bacteriophage phiX 174.  The histories
              of these lineages will be precisely known, as will their characteristics,
              monitored by molecular methods such as DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme
              mapping.  The molecular characteristics will provide the data from which
              phylogenies will be reconstructed and compared against the known histories. 
              Knowledge gained from this work will lead to a better understanding of the
              proper application of existing phylogenetic methods to recover the history of
              organisms in nature, and to refinements and improvements in these methods.  The
              project will be used as a tool for teaching students, in classroom and
              laboratory settings, about such diverse topics as mutations and mutagens,
              virology, molecular biology and biotechnology, and systematics, and will be
              instrumental in developing discovery-based approaches to the teaching of these
              areas of science.  Students will be involved in all stages of the research.
