Abstract    :
              ***  9629076  Mukherjee    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a next-generation Computer Aided Design (CAD) software
              package for three-dimensional (3D) stress analysis and optimal shape design of
              solid structural components.  Although use of CAD is quite common, the
              currently used finite element method (FEM) based approach has serious
              shortcomings.  The primary obstacle is the need to discretize (mesh) the entire
              domain of the 3D body into (volume) finite elements.  This task, which cannot
              be reliably and efficiently automated for bodies of complex shape, becomes
              particularly onerous during optimal shape design where the shape of the body
              changes during successive design iterations and, therefore, the body must be
              remeshed during each iteration.  Also, volume discretization is not naturally
              compatible with either solid modeling or with shape design algorithms.  This
              project uses an entirely new computational engine - the boundary contour method
              (BCM).  This approach only requires meshing of the bounding surface of a body
              and numerical evaluation of regular line integrals for 3D problems.  Therefore,
              automatic meshing, both initially and between design iterations, becomes
              straightforward and the need to evaluate only regular 1D integrals makes the
              process very efficient.  Also, the BCM approach, being surface based, is
              naturally compatible with both solid modeling and shape design algorithms.  The
              feasibility of the BCM approach, for stress and sensitivity analysis in 3D
              linear elasticity, has been demonstrated in the Phase I project.  The primary
              research tasks in Phase II, in addition to further code development and
              testing, are (a) coupling of the code with optimization software in order to
              carry out shape optimization, (b) adaptive meshing - both initially and during
              each design iteration and (c) development of a parallel version of the code for
              operation on a network of desk-top computers.    If the research is successful,
              the resulting package is expected  to be a significant advance in CAD
              technology.  It should help to blur the current artificial and costly
              distinction between analysis and design engineers, greatly reduce product time
              to market and product development cost, and should be in great demand
              throughout the industrial sector.  ***
