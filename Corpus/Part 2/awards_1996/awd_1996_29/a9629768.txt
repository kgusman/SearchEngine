Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT        9629768  Scharfen    Recognizing the
              scientific and economic value of the data  obtained from research activities in
              Antarctica and the need  to make this information available to the greater
              scientific  community, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research  (SCAR)
              instituted an ad hoc Planning Group on Antarctic Data  Management to provide
              recommendations on the preservation  and management of research and related
              data from Antarctic  programs.  The ad hoc planning group recommended that an 
              Antarctic Master Data Directory be established for handling  meta data and that
              each national program designate their own  National Antarctic Data Center
              (NADC) for management of data  from individual national programs.  These
              recommendations  were endorsed by the Antarctic Treaty Parties and by SCAR.   
              The World Data Center-A for Glaciology/National Snow and Ice  Data Center
              (WDC-A/NSIDC) will serve as the U.S. NADC for an  initial period of three
              years.  This effort will consist of  identifying and describing existing data
              in all disciplines,  using an approach similar to that already underway for 
              cryospheric data, and submitting these descriptions ("DIFs",  the Directory
              Interchange Format used for the International  Directory Network) to the
              Antarctic Master Directory being  developed by the International Centre for
              Antarctic  Information and Research (ICAIR).  The WDC-A/NSIDC will take 
              advantage of its on-going relationship with the Global  Change Mater Directory
              (GCMD) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight  Center, sharing information regarding
              data sources and  minimizing or eliminating duplication of effort.  The 
              WDC-A/NSIDC will write or assist data holders in writing  DIFs for Antarctic
              data collected by U.S. investigators.  Before submitting DIFs to the AMD, the
              WDC-A/NSIDC will  review and edit them, if necessary, to ensure they are 
              compliant with format and content standards.
