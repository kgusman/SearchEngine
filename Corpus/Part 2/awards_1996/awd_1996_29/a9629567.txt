Abstract    :
              9629567  Young        Much of the energy that drives atmospheric circulations 
              is obtained through exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum  with the
              surface.  Lake-effect events, where cold air masses  are rapidly modified over
              the Great Lakes, are excellent  natural laboratories for studying these
              exchanges. The Lake-  Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) is a multiple- 
              Principal Investigator project which seeks to use this  natural laboratory to
              determine how boundary layer growth  processes are controlled by mesoscale
              boundary layer  convective structures and how the modified boundary layer 
              effects the production of precipitation and the larger scale   meteorological
              conditions.         Because of strongly nonlinear multi-scale interactions, 
              the study of lake-induced phenomena requires a highly  collaborative team
              effort taking advantage of the skills of  multiple investigators and the
              capabilities of a range of  instruments and platforms.  Within the broader
              framework of  Lake-ICE the research to be performed under this award will 
              focus on two scientific objectives:          1.  To determine the nature,
              causes, and consequences of the   two-way interaction between individual
              km-scale convective  elements (i.e. three-dimensional thermal plumes) and the
              two-  dimensional mesoscale lake-effect cloud bands in which they  are
              embedded.    2.  To ascertain the degree to which these interactions lead   to
              a mesoscale modulation (i.e. cross-roll variation) in the   rate at which air
              is entrained across the temperature  inversion that caps the lake-induced
              convective boundary  layer.  ***
