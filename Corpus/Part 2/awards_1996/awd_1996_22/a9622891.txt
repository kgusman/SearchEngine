              ABSTRACT  Proposal: DMS-9622891  PI: Morpurgo     The main goals of the proposed
              research are:  1. Explicit computations of spectral invariants arising from the
              zeta function of natural pseudodifferential operators, in terms of conformal
              changes of metrics;  2. Analysis of such invariants on spaces such as
              n-dimensional spheres, tori, balls and shells, via either known or new sharp
              Sobolev or fractional integral inequalities.  Morpurgo proposes to carry out
              this research program for a large class of conformally covariant
              pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold (with or without boundary),
              and for some non-conformally covariant operators, such as the ordinary
              Laplacian in dimensions greater than 2. The computation  will be effected via
              either variational or direct new methods developed by the investigator. The
              explicit form of the invariants on spaces like spheres, tori, balls and shells
              will then be related to either known sharp inequalities, or will suggest
              possible new sharp inequalities, to be derived by the investigator using
              symmetrization and end-point differentiation arguments.     Understanding how
              the spectrum of differential operators change as the underlying geometry is
              varied is a fundamental problem in mathematics and physics. The results
              produced in the research will provide concrete and direct ways to control the
              spectrum of conformally covariant operators in terms of the metric structure of
              surface, and vice versa. Such operators arise naturally in the study of many
              physical phenomena, in fields such as electromagnetism, statistical mechanics,
              and the theory of random surfaces.
