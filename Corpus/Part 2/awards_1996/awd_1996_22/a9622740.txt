Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the use of wormhole networks in supporting cache- 
              coherent multiprocessors.  Cache coherence gtraffic, characterized by fixed 
              length messages that arrive in bursts, is generated by an execution-driven 
              simulator.  This traffic is used to evaluate alternative message scheduling 
              schemes, adaptive routing schemes, virtual channels, and interface designs. 
              New  coherence and synchronization schemes are being developed and evaluated as
              part  of this research.    The project is divided into three phases.  In the
              first phase the effect of  congestion in the interconnection network in
              performane of cache-coherent  multiprocessors is being investigated.  The
              second phase emphasizes the  development of techniques to reduce cache
              coherence traffic and invalidation  time.  The third phase is the development
              of new protocols that use wormhole  networks effectively.
