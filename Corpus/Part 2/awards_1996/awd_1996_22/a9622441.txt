Abstract    :
              9622441  PITTENGER         In 1996 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will
              operate the  research vessels ATLANTIS II, KNORR and OCEANUS in support of NSF-
               sponsored research.         The KNORR will finish the WOCE Indian Ocean work
              in early  1996.  Two multibeam cruises will utilize the new multibeam 
              capability of the ship.  The Knorr will support a chemistry cruise  off the
              coast of Brazil before heading to the "Rainbow Site" off  Barbados.  The Navy
              will use the vessel in the Baltic and then it  will return to WHOI for an
              extended maintenance period .         OCEANUS will support a variety of cruises
              in the northeast  Atlantic and one cruise off Bermuda.  The vessel will support
              211  operational days of which 75 are in support of NSF-sponsored  programs. 
              The remaining 136 days are in support of Navy and DOE  programs.          
              ATLANTIS II provides support for the Deep Submergence Vehicle  ALVIN, all 1996
              AII cruises are in support of the unmanned  submersible.  The schedule begins
              with two cruises off the coast of  California with a 2 month stand-down period
              between the cruises.   The vessel will support a series of cruises off the East
              Pacific  Rise before transiting to the Atlantic to support cruises off the 
              east coast of the US and one cruise off Bermuda.         The vessels operated
              by WHOI are part of a fleet of ships used  by the National Science Foundation
              in support of marine science.   Oceanography requires highly specialized
              equipment that is required  to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus
              specialized ships.   These vessels do not operate in the same general mode as 
              cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of  a variety
              of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic  research that are operated
              by universities and institutions around  the country.  ***
