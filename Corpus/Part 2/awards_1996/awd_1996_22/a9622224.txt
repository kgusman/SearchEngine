Abstract    :
              Heinzer  9622224    This proposal supports the work of Professor W. Heinzer to
              work  on problems in commutative algebra. He intends to study  intermediate
              rings between a local domain and its completion. He  also intends to study the
              structure of ideals in a two  dimensional regular local ring, the ramification
              of prime ideals  in infinite integral extensions, the contraction of ideals
              from  one dimensional overrings with applications to primary  decomposition in
              powers of ideals in Noetherian rings, and the  content of Gaussian polynomials.
                  This research is on the boundary between commutative algebra and  algebraic
              geometry. Both fields  arose from the classical problem  of studying
              mathematical objects defined in the plane by the  simplest of equations, namely
              polynomials. Today, the fields use  methods not only from algebra, but also
              from analysis and  topology, and conversely are extensively used in those
              fields.   Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as 
              physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding  theory and
              robotics.
