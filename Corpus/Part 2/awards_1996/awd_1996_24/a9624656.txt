Abstract    :
              9624656  Casper  This study will examine the combined effect of aboveground and
              belowground competition on plant performance in an oldfield plant community. 
              Current literature assumes that their combined effect is simply the sum of each
              effect by itself.  However, belowground competition is likely to affect plant
              response to aboveground competition and vice versa.  Whether their combined
              effect is greater than, equal to, or less than the sum of each separate effect
              may depend on the relative strength of the aboveground versus belowground
              interactions.  These ideas will be tested in a field experiment in which
              gradients in the intensity of aboveground and belowground competition will be
              crossed in a full factorial design at two levels of soil fertility.  The growth
              response of target individuals of the annual plant, Abutilon theophrasti, will
              be used as the dependent variable.  The belowground competition gradient will
              be created through the use of soil partitions with different degrees of
              accessibility by neighboring roots.  Aboveground competition will be varied by
              pulling back portions of neighboring shoots.  This research will be the first
              to test directly the additivity of competitive forms in a field experiment.  It
              will also be able to test whether belowground competition decreases in
              importance with increased soil resources.
