Abstract    :
              Optimization methods based on ideas from statistical physics have been developed
              to tackle a diverse set of hard problems including image segmentation, data
              clustering, and graph partitioning.  These problems involve the assignment of
              elements viewed as ``data'' to one of a set of classes, so as to minimize the
              resulting cost. This project develops a novel extension of physics-based
              approaches to tackle the important, challenging sub-class of
              structurally-constrained data association problems, wherein assignments are
              constrained to agree with a parameterized classification rule such as that of a
              neural network or decision tree model. Central to the project is supervised
              learning, including statistical classification and regression/function
              approximation.  Physics-based learning approaches have the potential to address
              fundamental learning problems such as convergence to non-global optima,
              parsimonious modelling, and generalization. Preliminary classification work
              already suggests that there is great promise for these new methods in
              outperforming existing learning algorithms.  The specific project objectives
              are of both practical and theoretical significance, as they include development
              of learning algorithms for widely used classifier structures, investigating
              parsimonious modelling in part via phase transition analysis, tackling
              application areas such as speech recognition and condition-based maintenance,
              and extending the methods to address regression/function approximation and
              missing data problems.
