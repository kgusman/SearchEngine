Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to create an integrated, interactive, 3-D
              virtual environment consisting of anatomical parts, and physiological and
              pathophysiological processes. The approach consists of modeling: 1) Deformable
              soft tissue for anatomical organs, 2) Anatomical parts that are responsive to
              physiological changes, 3) Physiological behavior models, 4) Formal methods for
              integrating anatomical parts and physiological process variables and
              parameters, 5) Recovery of patient-specific data for anatomy (through computer
              vision techniques) and physiology, and 6) Real-time simulation and
              visualization methods.  The results of this research will contribute: 1) New
              methodologies to enhance medical education through immersive visualization and
              interaction, and 2) Clinically-relevant and patient-specific models of acute
              injuries in trauma.  The goal of the educational plan is the use of the
              software that will be developed from the proposed research in courses at the
              University of Pennsylvania. Through the exposure to a sophisticated and formal
              approach to science, new students are expected to appreciate and develop a
              deeper understanding of mathematics, physics, computer vision, computer
              graphics, and virtual environments, and their synthesis.
