Abstract    :
              9624966  Shen   This CAREER award will investigate the research issues
              associated with metrology in manufacturing science and technology, with
              emphasis on coordinate measuring machines (CMM).  It will enhance the
              manufacturing education program with the introduction of a geometric
              dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) curriculum, complemented by a newly
              developed metrology laboratory.  The research objectives are to develop a
              methodology for assessing uncertainties in CMM measurements, so that
              compensation and sampling strategies can be designed to improve the accuracy
              and productivity of precision dimensional measurement.  Because competition
              demands precision products, the educational component's curriculum for
              metrology and GD&T is important for developing engineers with not only a
              quality focus, but with experience on how to achieve precision.  The principal
              investigator has a record of collaborating with the National Institute of
              Standards and Technology and Brown and Sharpe on precision metrology, and this
              collaboration will expand with this award.     This project shows innovation
              and collaboration in research and education.  Results from this work have the
              potential to increase the accuracy and productivity of coordinate measuring
              machines, and the educational component will enhance the human infrastructure
              needed to design and manufacture quality precision products.
