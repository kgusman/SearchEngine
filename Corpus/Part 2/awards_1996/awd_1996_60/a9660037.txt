Abstract    :
                ***  9660037  Ayres    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is to eliminate the hazards of silane cylinders by investigating the
              feasibility of producing silane with an on-site gas generator. The generator
              will produce silane on-demand at low pressure ( 20-40 psig), and with low
              hold-up volume (2 liters). The generator will be much safer than cylinder
              silane (1250 psig, 3500 liters storage volume per cylinder) and eliminate the
              need for storage of large numbers of cylinders.  Semiconductor manufacturing
              requires the deposition of silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride
              layers. These steps are applied to products as diverse VLSI circuits, memory
              chips, flat panel active matrix displays, photocopier drums, and large area
              solar cells. All of these processes require silane gas (SiH4). Silane is
              spontaneously flammable in air, has a toxicity exposure limit of 0.5 ppm, and
              explosively reacts with halogens such as chlorine. Silane is the largest volume
              pyrophoric gas used by the semiconductor industry. These factors make silane
              use dangerous in semiconductor fabrication facilities where large quantities
              are stored in hundreds of high pressure compressed gas cylinders. These
              cylinders are inherent sources of danger because of the possibility of gas
              release during transportation, storage, and handling. Evacuating a
              semiconductor facility due to a silane cylinder leak disrupts production and is
              very expensive. Semiconductor companies expend significant amounts on
              preventing and containing possible leaks from silane cylinders. These
              expenditures add to manufacturing costs, and decrease the competitive position
              of U.S. semiconductor companies.   An on-site, point-of-use silane gas
              generator would be widely purchased by major semiconductor manufacturing
              companies to eliminate the environmental liability of transporting and using
              silane gas cylinders.  ***
