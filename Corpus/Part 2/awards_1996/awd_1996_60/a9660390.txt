Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              new technique for the growth of carbon nitride thin films.  The technique is
              based on the reaction of high velocity (3 to 8 km/s) carbon/nitrogen atom beams
              with surfaces.  Carbon nitride is predicted to be a material with tribological
              and electronic applications and hence significant effort has been devoted to
              its synthesis.  These efforts have met with limited success.  A recent advance
              is the synthesis using a dual atomic beam source of a pure C2N phase having
              diamond-like carbon properties. This research will explore single atomic beam
              synthesis at energies between 1 and 10 eV.  This energy range can lead to
              higher reactivity without amorphorization and can be commercially applied.  In
              Phase I, an atomic beam containing carbon and nitrogen atoms will be generated,
              characterized and used to deposit thin films on silicon substrates.  The thin
              films will be analyzed for composition and bonding.  The deposition of films
              with extended solid bonding and high nitrogen content will verify the growth
              technique.       The development of a technique for carbon nitride thin film
              growth can have tribological and possibly electronic applications.  The
              developed atom technique can also be used for the growth of other
              technologically important nitride materials.
