Abstract    :
              9604321  Abbott    Today, 2.3 million couples in USA are infertile.  One third 
              of these cases are due to ovarian-related infertility in  women, and
              psychosocial causes of anovulation contribute to  20-30% of these ovarian
              impairments.  Cooperatively breeding  animals (animal societies in which more
              individuals than the  single breeding pair aid in raising the breeders'
              offspring)  provide unique models for the investigation of  psychosocial 
              control of ovulation in females.  Dr. Abbott and Saltzman  are studying a
              species in which mature, socially subordinate  females exhibit profound
              suppression of ovulation and  behavior.  This socially induced infertility is
              not due to  generalized stress and can be readily reversed, depending  upon a
              female's social status.  By employing specific  behavioral and physiological
              techniques, Dr. Abbott and Dr.  Saltzman will examine the neuroendocrine
              mechanisms by which  animals reverse their ability to reproduce.  Using
              state-of-  the-art  technology in push-pull perfusion, they will  measure
              gonadotropin releasing-hormone from the hypothalamus  to determine whether
              transitory elevations in release of  this important hormone mediates the
              behaviorally-induced  transition from the anovulatory state to the onset of 
              cyclicity.   The results from these studies will elucidate  the behavioral and
              neural mechanisms underlying the  psychosocial control of fertility  in
              females.  This basic  knowledge will lead to a better understanding of 
              infertility.  The results are also important in conservation  efforts to help
              understand problems associated with  fertility in endangered species.
