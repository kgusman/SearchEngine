Abstract    :
              IBN-9604071  Roberts         Normal function of the gonads in mammals requires
              feedback  regulation by the brain and the pituitary gland.  During the past  10
              years, it has been shown that a protein called activin is  produced in the
              ovaries, testes, and pituitary and that this  protein is required for the
              normal functioning of these  reproductive organs.  Dr. Roberts recently
              demonstrated that  activin is also produced in the brain and is localized in
              neural  regions known to be involved in the feedback regulation of the 
              hormonal system involved in reproductive functioning.   She will  now determine
              whether this activin protein plays a pivotal role in  the regulation of the
              reproductive axis at the level  of the  brain.  Utilizing anatomical
              techniques, Dr. Roberts will trace  activin producing neurons and to determine
              whether these activin  neurons connect and communicate with gonadotropin
              releasing  hormone neurons (GnRH), an important peptide hormone that  regulates
              the release of estrogen and progesterone by the ovary.  She will also use
              isolated GnRH neurons in culture to directly  test the effects of activin on
              these reproductive neurons.  The  results from these studies will determine
              whether activin  modulates GnRH synthesis and release to help maintain its 
              homeostatic regulation. The new knowledge obtained from these  studies will
              form the basis for understanding the neuroendocrine  role of activin in the
              human reproductive system.  This  information is crucial for dissecting  the
              basic mechanisms by  which the  brain-pituitary-gonads work together to
              regulate the  timing of ovulation and thus, could be lead to a better 
              understanding of infertility and its treatment.
