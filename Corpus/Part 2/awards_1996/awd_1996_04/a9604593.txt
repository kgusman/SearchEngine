Abstract    :
              9604593  Banks    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Molecular and Genetic Approaches  for the Analysis
              of Fern Development and Evolution, to be  held in West Lafayette, Indiana from
              July 28-31, 1997.  The  co-organizers are Dr. Jo Ann Banks of Purdue University
              and  Dr. Akeo Kadota of the Tokyo Metropolitan University in  Japan.  This
              seminar has three objectives: 1) to explore the  diversity of questions in
              plant development and evolution  that can be addressed most effectively using
              ferns as model  systems; 2) to discuss the genetic, biochemical and  molecular
              tools that must be developed and implemented in  order to understand these
              questions at the cellular,  molecular and mechanistic level; and 3) to educate
              and  encourage ideas from graduate students and postdoctoral  researchers in
              the use of ferns as experimental systems in  studies of plant growth,
              development and evolution.  %%%  The primitive features of ferns have
              facilitated the study  of fundamental aspects of plant development, especially 
              those that are difficult or impossible to study in flowering  plants.  This
              seminar will bring together American and  Japanese researchers who work on the
              molecular biology and  genetics of fern development using different model
              species.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese scientists will  enable
              the U.S. scientists to advance their own work.  The  seminar will involve
              active participation by graduate  students and postdoctoral researchers, and
              the results of  the meeting will be widely disseminated via a World Wide Web 
              homepage.  ***
