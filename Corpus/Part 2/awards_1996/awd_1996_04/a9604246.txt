Abstract    :
              9604246  Rea  Re-establishment of the resting state after stimulus-coupled
              elevations of cytosolic free Ca2+ requires the rapid removal of Ca2+ from the
              cytosol of plant cells. The investigator  in collaboration with Drs. Hirschi
              and Fink, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, has recently isolated
              two cDNAs, CAXl and CAX2, from Arabidopsis thaliana.  These cDNA's suppress a
              mutation in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain defective in vacuolar Ca2+
              accumulation (Hirschi et al., 1996). Experiments on vacuolar membrane-enriched
              vesicles isolated from yeast expressing CAXl or CAX2 demonstrate that these
              genes encode high efficiency and low efficiency H+/Ca2+ exchangers,
              respectively. The properties of the CAXl gene product indicate that it is the
              high capacity transporter responsible for contributing to the maintenance of
              low cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations in plant cells by catalyzing pH
              gradient-energized vacuolar Ca2+ accumulation. Having cloned CAXl and CAX2 and
              broadly defined the functional characteristics of their translation products in
              yeast, the investigator aims now to extend his studies of one of these, CAXlp,
              the putative vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter, to better defining its transport
              capabilities and membrane localization in the intact plant. The main objectives
              of the research program are be four-fold: (1) Determination of the plant
              membrane fraction(s) with which CAXlp is associated. The investigator's data
              strongly indicate that CAXlp corresponds to the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter but
              this remains to be tested directly. (2) The development of procedures for the
              purification and reconstitution of CAXlp. This is necessary for studies of the
              sufficiency of CAXlp for H+/Ca2+ antiport, and possibly other antiport
              functions, and the provision of material for future investigations of transport
              stoichiometry and structure-function relations. (3) Elucidation of the
              electrogenicity, and thence transport stoichiometry, of CAXlp-mediated H+/Ca2+
              exchange. It is critical to know the numbe r of H+ ions exchanged per Ca2+
              since this determines the maximum accumulation ratio that can be achieved by
              CAXlp under the conditions prevailing in vivo. This, in turn, will provide
              indications of the physiological function of CAXlp. (4) Examination of the
              capacity of CAXlp for the transport of Na+ as well as Ca2+ or Na+ as well as
              H+. The investigator has shown that CAXlp catalyzes Ca2+ transport in
              preference to other divalent cations but it is not known if Na+ can substitute
              for H+ as driver ion or whether CAXlp is competent in Na+/H+ antiport as well
              as H+/Ca2+ antiport, as is the case for some non-plant H+/Ca2+ and Na+/Ca2+
              antiporters. Knowledge of its membrane localization, sufficiency, likely
              physiological poise and ion-selectivity will provide a firm foundation for
              future investigations, by both the investigator  and others, of the regulation,
              structure-function characteristics and physiological impact of CAXlp on general
              ion homeostasis and Ca2+-dependent stimulus-response coupling in plants.       
                    The coordination of many plant cell responses to stimuli, such as light,
              gravity, touch and cold, is mediated by changes in cytoplasmic calcium ion (
              Ca2+) concentration. A major intracellular reservoir for some of the Ca2+
              involved in these processes is the vacuole. Since the vacuolar concentration of
              Ca2+ is often 10,000 times higher than that of the cytoplasm, and the
              maintenance of low cytoplasmic concentrations is critical for normal cell
              function, efficient systems for concentrating Ca2+ in the vacuole are required.
              One of these is a transporter, a calcium-proton antiporter, located in the
              membrane surrounding the vacuole. This membrane protein harnesses the
              electrochemical energy contained in the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration
              gradient across this membrane to drive the transport of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm
              into the vacuole by exchanging vacuolar H+ for cytoplasmic Ca2+. This research
              is concerned with understanding the molecular mechanism of this transporter.
