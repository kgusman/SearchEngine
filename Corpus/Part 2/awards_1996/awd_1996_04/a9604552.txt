Abstract    :
              Bennett  9604552      The basic mystery of development is how a fertilized egg
              can correctly become a complex adult organism. The Bennett laboratory is
              interested in how a particular cell lineage, the germline, is established. In
              the 1 6-cell embryo of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, one founder
              cell, P4, will become the entire adult germline. Surrounding the nucleus of the
              P4 primordial germ cell are non-membrane-bound particles called P granules.
              Germ granules similar to the P granules have been described in the primordial
              germ cells of many animals. It is important for understanding the overall role
              of germ granules in animal development to consider how germ granules function
              in Caenorhabditis and humans. The Bennett laboratory has recently reported on
              two P-granule components, the germline RNA kelicases, GLH-1 and GLH-2. By now
              focusing on the function of GLH-1 and GLH-2, this project will begin to
              discriminate their roles in the P granules and in germline development.
              Transposon-tagged glh-1 and glh-2 mutant strains will be identified and will be
              phenotypically analyzed. In addition, the RNA helicase activity of the GLH
              proteins will be confirmed by standard biochemical assays. The predicted GLH
              proteins contain several motifs not found in other RNA helicases, motifs likely
              to be critical to GLH function. These include multiple retroviral-like CCHC
              zinc fingers. Similar zinc fingers, best studied in HIV, bind RNA with
              selectivity. It is proposed that the various GLH zinc fingers add RNA binding
              specificity. In addition, N-terminal glycine-rich repeats, found in both GLH-1
              and GLH-2, may function in P granule aggregation. These hypotheses will be
              tested by in vitro analyses. If RNA specificity can be demonstrated for in
              vitro-produced GLH proteins, the RNAs bound can begin to be identified.
              Detailed studies of the function and regulation of glh genes and the
              identification of the RNAs they bind may reveal that GLHs are critical germline
              determinants.
