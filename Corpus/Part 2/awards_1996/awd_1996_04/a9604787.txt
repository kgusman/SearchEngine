Abstract    :
                   Funds are requested to replace an existing Varian VXR 500-S 500 MHz  NMR
              spectrometer console,  which is part of the Chemistry Department NMR Facility
              at Florida State  University.    Our objective is to replace the existing
              console with one having three  independent radio frequency  (rf) channels,
              waveform generators for  each rf channel, and a three-axis pulsed-field
              gradient accessory. To  take advantage of the additional hardware capabilities,
              we will also  purchase a total of three new double- and triple-resonance probes
              and  an off-line Silicon Graphics Indy workstation out-fitted with an  external
              hard-drive and a CD recorder. The 11.7 T Oxford  super-conducting magnet, which
              has very good drift and lineshape  specifications, will not be replaced. To
              optimize the lineshape of the  water resonance in biological samples, a new
              room-temperature shim set  will be purchased. This course of action will
              substantially enhance the  overall capabilities of the instrument in a
              cost-effective manner,  while retaining the desirable functional components of
              the existing  system.     The replacement spectrometer console will be used for
              solution  studies of ( 1 ) glycoprotein structural biology, (2) protein
              folding,  (3) protein-solvent interactions, (4) RNA structure, (5) structures
              of  RNAprotein complexes, and (6) larger organic molecules.
