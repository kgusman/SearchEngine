Abstract    :
              9604877  Shafi  Description:  This award will support the participation of up to
               ten leading U.S. scientists and advanced graduate students at the   BCSPIN
              (Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Nepal)  regional Physics School
              in Kathmandu, Nepal from May 19-June 3,  1997.  The subject matter is "Current
              Trends in High Energy  Physics and Cosmology".  Many of the leading topics in
              high  energy physics and cosmology will be presented.  In addition to  the core
              set of lectures, discussion groups will be created  enabling participation in
              "cutting edge" research and the  initiation of collaborations.  The major goal
              of BCSPIN is to  provide a stimulating environment in which the brightest
              student,  postdocs and faculty from the BCSPIN countries can come in to 
              contact with leading physicists, particularly from the U.S.      Scope:  The
              establishment of a school of excellence in physics  will enhance interest in
              this field in the South Asia region and   will greatly strengthen the
              scientific potential of young  researchers there.  Without the opportunity
              given by a school of  this kind, it is unlikely that the majority of the
              students would  ever have exposure to such outstanding scientists.  Previous 
              schools have been highly regarded and the best students will no  doubt
              eventually enrich American science.  BCSPIN is supported   multinationally with
              substantial funding provided by the  International Center for Theoretical
              Physics in Triest.        This award is jointly funded by the Division of
              International  Programs and the Division of   Physics.    ***
