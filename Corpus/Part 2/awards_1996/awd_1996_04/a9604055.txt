Abstract    :
              Champness  9604055  Streptomycetes, filamentous soil bacteria, possess two
              characteristics that make them attractive prokaryotes for study:  they develop
              into complex, multicellular, differentiated colonies and they produce a vast
              array of secondary metabolites, many of which are useful as antibiotics. 
              Antibiotic production is usually coupled to morphological differentiation,
              beginning at the transition between vegetative growth and production of
              pre-spore differentiated hyphae.  The long term goal of this research is to
              discover the genes that regulate antibiotic synthesis, to understand how they
              function, and to determine their functional relationships in the regulatory
              network controlling antibiotic gene expression.   The immediate objectives of
              this proposal focus on three genetic elements discovered in previous NSF
              funding periods:  absA, absB and mia.  Research will proceed along the
              following lines:  1.  The mechanism by which the absA-encoded signal
              transduction system exerts global        negative control over antibiotic gene
              expression will be determined.  Genetic,         molecular  genetic and
              biochemical experiments will:  a) characterize functionally         important
              regions and interactions of the AbsA1/A2 "sensor-kinase" and response        
              regulator proteins; b) establish the role of protein phosphorylation in
              AbsA-mediated                       regulation; and c) explore the genetic
              pathway through which absA regulates         expression of the antibiotic
              "pathway-specific regulators."  2.  The absB gene and its probable gene
              product, an RNaseIII, will be characterized        through determination of the
              RNaseIII (absB) null phenotype, functional studies on        the S. coelicolor
              RNaseIII, and identification of candidate RNaseIII targets.  3.  The 190 nt mia
              sequence, which exerts multi-copy inhibition of antibiotic gene       
              expression, will be characterized to determine the functional regions of the
              sequence.  The results of the proposed work promise to elucidate aspec ts of
              the regulatory programs controlling streptomycete gene expression, and to
              expand our understanding of microbial multicellular differentiation.
