Abstract    :
                  Becraft  96-04426      Plant leaves are covered by a highly specialized
              epidermal layer which functions in development to delimit organs and prevent
              organ fusions. The endosperm of grass seeds also contains an epidermis-like
              cell layer called the aleurone which secretes hydrolytic enzymes required for
              remobilization of storage compounds during germination. The crinkly4 (cr4) gene
              of maize is involved in the differentiation of leaf epidermis and aleurone. cr4
              encodes a receptor kinase with extracellular similarity to the ligand binding
              domain of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) from mammals. Tumor necrosis
              factors (TNFs) are small protein signal molecules that are involved in
              developmental processes in the immune system and other tissues. The similarity
              between CR4 and TNFR suggests that the ligand for CR4 might also be a protein
              of the TNF class. Genomic southern hybridization suggests that cr4 is a member
              of a gene family. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1. Complete a
              molecular genetic analysis of the maize cr4 gene. This includes generating an
              allelic series of cr4 mutants and analyzing the expression pattern of the cr4
              gene. The expression pattern will be studied using immunohistochemistry and
              genetic mosaic analyses. 2. Isolate a ligand for the extracellular domain of
              CR4. Three different approaches are proposed: A. molecular identification of a
              cloned gene that encodes a protein able to bind the extracellular domain of CR4
              (i.e. interaction cloning), B. genetic identification of an interacting protein
              by analysis of mutants with similar phenotypes to cr4, or by identification of
              second site mutations that enhance or suppress the cr4 mutant phenotype, and C.
              a transgenic approach to introduce specifically engineered mutations that can
              be used in genetic suppressor screens. 3. Characterize the cr4 gene family in
              arabidopsis to determine the extent of the family, whether all members encode
              receptor kineses and the expression profiles for each member.
