Abstract    :
                Vernon  96-04344      In plants, embryogenesis is a crucial stage of
              development in which numerous cell types are defined, meristems are
              established, and the basic body plan is formed.  Despite its importance,
              embryogenesis remains perhaps the least-understood period of plant development.
               One powerful strategy for investigating embryogenesis is the analysis of
              mutants impaired in various aspects of embryonic development.  Many such
              embryo-defective (emb) mutants have been identified in the model plant system
              Arabidopsis thaliana. The proposed research will contribute to our
              understanding of plant embryogenesis via characterization of two intriguing
              Arabidopsis embryo-defective mutants, emb88 and twn 1. Emb88 is representative
              of a little-studied class of early embryo-defectives, the round embryo (rem)
              mutants.  These mutants exhibit disorganized cell architecture and incomplete
              morphogenesis.  Recent molecular analysis of EMB88 indicates that this gene
              encodes a novel plant protein similar to animal proteins involved in cell
              signal transduction.  Thus, EMB88 may help define an essential cell signaling
              pathway not previously identified in plants.  The proposed characterization of
              emb88 includes cloning and sequencing of the EMB88 CDNA, analysis of EMB88 gene
              expression, comparison of genomic structure of the mutant and wild-type
              alleles, and complementation of the mutant phenotype with the wild-type gene. 
              This molecular characterization will elucidate the role of this gene in
              embryogenesis, and pave the way for future biochemical and genetic dissection
              of the pathway in which EMB88 may play a role.  The second mutant, twn I,
              displays an unusual phenotype: two or more viable embryos often develop within
              a single seed.  Secondary embryos arise when cells of the suspensor, a
              specialized structure that forms early in embryogenesis, lose their identity
              and undergo embryogenic transformation.  Thus the twn I gene appears to
              suppress a default embryogenic pathway in suspensor cells, and this mutant 
              offers an excellent system in which to investigate the relationship between
              cell differentiation and suppression of totipotency in the early plant embryo. 
              The proposed experiments on twn I will address the physiological basis of the
              twn I phenotype and better define the role of this gene in embryo development.
