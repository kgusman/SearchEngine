Abstract    :
              9604299  Striedter    The ability to learn complex vocalizations has evolved
              only  in humans, songbirds, and parrots.  This project  investigates how the
              neural circuits controlling  vocalization have changed during the evolution of
              vocal  learning.  Particular emphasis is placed on an area of the  midbrain, as
              the function of this region is hypothesized to  have changed significantly as
              the capacity for vocal  behavior moves from being genetically coded to being 
              dependent on learning.  Neuroanatomical analysis of the  inputs and outputs of
              this area, observations of the  behavioral effects of damage to this area, and 
              electrophysiological examination of the activity of midbrain  neurons are all
              used to test comparative analysis is then  used to reconstruct how neural
              circuitry and behavioral  function of the vocal control system change during 
              evolution.  In doing so, this is one of the first studies to  examine how
              historical constraints can influence current  brain function.  The results of
              this study enhance our  understanding of the brain's systems for controlling
              vocal  behavior, including human speech, as well as improve our  understanding
              of how nervous systems in general evolve to  accomodate complex new behavioral
              abilities within the  constraints of preexisting circuits with preexisting 
              functions.  Such research is important in advancing  knowledge about how
              natural and artificial learning systems  acquire increasingly complex abilities
              as a function of  experience.
