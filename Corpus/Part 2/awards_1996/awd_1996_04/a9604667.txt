Abstract    :
                  Lassar, Andrew B.  IBN: 96-04667    The central goal of this grant is to
              understand how signals from surrounding tissues activate the expression of
              Pax-3 in the dermomyotome. Work in Dr. Lassar's lab is focused on understanding
              the regulatory signals that induce formation of vertebrate skeletal muscle.
              Although it is clear that expression of either MyoD or Myf-5 is essential for
              the formation of skeletal muscle, it has hitherto been unclear how these genes
              are activated during development.  He has recently begun to address what
              regulatory molecules mediate the induction of MyoD and Myf-5 by signals from
              either the axial tissues (i.e. the neural tube/notochord) or the overlying
              ectoderm. Recently he has found that the same signals that induce somitic
              myogenesis induce somitic expression of the paired box transcription factors,
              Pax-3 and Pax-7, prior to inducing high level expression of either Myf-5 or
              MyoD. Furthermore, infection of somites in vitro with a retrovirus encoding
              Pax-3 (which is normally expressed in the dermomyotome) is sufficient to induce
              expression of MyoD, Myf-5 myogenin, and myosin heavy chain in paraxial mesoderm
              in the absence of inducing tissues.  His  results indicate that signals that
              activate somitic expression of Pax-3/Pax-7 also activate somitic myogenesis and
              that ectopic expression of Pax-3 can activate myogenesis in the absence of
              other inducing signals. Together, these findings suggest that Pax-3 may mediate
              activation of MyoD and Myf-5 in response to the muscle inducing signals from
              either the axial tissues or overlying ectoderm.    In this study, he seeks to:
              (1) identify the region(s) of the Pax-3 gene that drives dermomyotomal
              expression of a Pax-3 transgene in transiently injected mice embryos, (2)
              identify the sequences in this regulatory region that directly respond to
              Shh/Wnt signals or ectodermal signals, and (3) clone the transcription factors
              that interact with these regulatory sequences. The goal of this study is to
              elucidate how signal transduction  pathways are integrated in the paraxial
              mesoderm to control expression of a key regulatory gene, Pax-3, which itself
              induces somitic myogenesis.
