Abstract    :
                  9632850  Tsai    Steel reinforcing bars for concrete suffer from limited 
              resistance to corrosion, costly field assembly and lack of  ductility under
              severe earthquake.  Composite materials have  outstanding corrosion and fatigue
              resistance and a weight  1/5 of steel.  Graphite fiber/organic matrix
              unidirectional  composite materials have outstanding longitudinal stiffness 
              over 20,000ksi and tensile strength over 200ksi, and when  properly designed
              can compete directly with steel rebars.  It is therefore the goal of this
              proposal to demonstrate and  develop:         A novel manufacturing method of
              composite grid    reinforcement.         Rapid factory/field assembly of
              reinforcing system.         Grid reinforced containment skin for columns.      
                Test data on columns subjected to static, dynamic and    cyclic loads.
