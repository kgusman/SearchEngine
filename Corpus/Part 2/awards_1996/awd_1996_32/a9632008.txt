Abstract    :
              Spall  9632008    A dual-processor Silicon Graphics Power Challenge L deskside
              server will be purchased to provide supercomputing capabilities for the
              Department of Mechanical EngineeringOs Computational Mechanics Laboratory. 
              Each of the R8000 processors is capable of 300 MFlops peak performance.  The
              server will be configured with 512 MB RAM and 13 GB disk space.  The Large
              Scale Flow Separation with Applications in the design of air-cooled aircraft
              engines.  This project is related to an existing research arrangement between
              the University of South Alabama and local industry, the purpose of which is to
              increase our knowledge of the fluid flow about and heat transfer about finned
              cylinders.  The results may then be used to improve the design of cylinder
              barrels and cylinder heads for air-cooled aircraft engines.  Numerical studies
              of the evolution of a turbulent wing-tip vortex and vortex breakdown.  This
              project is related to the principal investigatorOs work with NASA to further
              our understanding of the effects of turbulence on vortex breakdown.  Unsteady
              mixed convection in horizontal ducts with applications in chemical vapor
              deposition processes.  In this NASA sponsored work, the experimentally observed
              process of spanwise symmetry breaking about the duct mid-plane will be
              investigated in an effort to provide a means of improved deposition uniformity
              within horizontal chemical vapor deposition reactors.  The computational
              facility will also improve the College of EngineeringOs ability to fulfill its
              support for graduate level education and applied research.  ***
