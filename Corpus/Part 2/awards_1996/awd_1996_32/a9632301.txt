Abstract    :
              ***  9632301  Hsu       This Phase I STTR project will research and develop
              novel fiber Fabry-Perot tunable filters (FFP-TFs) based on fluoride fibers
              (specifically ZBLAN fibers), and the application of FFP-TFs in the generation
              of high-power, narrow-linewidth, and wavelength-tunable Pr-doped ZBLAN fiber
              lasers in the 1.3 um wavelength region. Recent major advances in Praseodymium
              (Pr)-doped fluoride glass fibers have made them the most desirable medium for
              fiber amplifiers and lasers at 1.3~1m wavelength. The availability of prototype
              Pr-doped fiber amplifiers for 1.3 um wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) has
              heightened the need for 1.3~m lasers. Commercially available widely-tunable
              laser sources are typically based on grating-tuned external-cavity
              semiconductor lasers suitable only for laboratory environment. The requirement
              for 1.3 um tunable lasers that are fiber-compatible, robust, and cost-effective
              makes an all-fiber based tunable laser structure the best candidate.      
              These lasers will allow telecommunication systems to access an additional 100nm
              of frequency spectrum using standard 1.3~m single-mode fibers which have been
              widely installed throughout the world. In addition, the resultant work will
              enable broad-based ZBLAN fiber device technology development that can be
              extended to other wavelength regions, e.g., to tunable upconverted blue-green
              lasers and mid-IR lasers using appropriate dopants in ZBLAN fibers. Additional
              applications using such new tunable lasers span from holographic data storage
              (tunable blue-green lasers) and free space optical communication to
              spectroscopy and environmental sensing (with tunable mid-IR lasers).   ***
