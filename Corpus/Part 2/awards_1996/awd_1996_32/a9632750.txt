Abstract    :
              This dissertation improvement award is being used to defray the costs of major
              research trips in the United States to various repositories and libraries
              holding literature on the Appropriate Technology (AT) movement.  Defined by its
              preference for small-scale, democratically controllable technologies that are
              not capital intensive, adaptable to local cultural conditions, and
              environmentally sustainable, the AT movement has been dismissed by some
              scholars as a product of the self-indulgent countercultural escapism of the
              1960s and 70s.  Others have seen great promise in the movement's ideas and
              projects.  Through extensive archival research, oral histories, and empirical
              observation of demonstration projects at governmental and non-governmental
              organizations across the nation, the student will use primary sources and
              intensive immersion in the ideas and activities which shape and constitute the
              AT movement to consider the merits of these alternative views.  The
              dissertation will examine the historical significance of the AT movement and
              explore its relationship to the environmental and sustainable agriculture
              movements, as well as its views on urbanization, professionalization, and
              democratic participation.  The work will attempt also to place the AT critique
              of industrial society in the context of a growing body of American social
              criticism of orthodox technological practice.  By evaluating the promise of the
              movement's vision, the dissertation fills an important gap in American
              historical scholarship and brings contemporary deliberation over America's
              technological direction into sharper focus.
