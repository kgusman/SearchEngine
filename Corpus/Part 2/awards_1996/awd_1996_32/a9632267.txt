              Abstract  ATM-9632267  Abbott, Mark B.  University of Massachusetts  Title:
              Holocene Paleohydrology of the Subtropical Andes from Lake  Records    The
              primary objective of this project is to establish new multi-  proxy Holocene
              paleoclimate records from the subtropical Andes.   Previous work suggests a
              prolonged period of aridity during the  mid-Holocene, however, more work to
              produce diatom and isotope  records is necessary to confirm this hypothesis and
              determine the  extent of this dry phase.  Specifically, this award will support
              a  study  to define the timing of changes in the precipitation-  evaporation
              balance of the Andean Altiplano on a decadal to century  timescale for the
              Holocene.  These records are needed to understand  the long-term atmospheric
              dynamics of the subtropics and to assess  the importance of decadal to
              millennial-scale shifts in the  strength of summer convection.  The Holocene
              climate history of the  region will be reconstructed by analyzing the sediment,
               geochemical, magnetic, isotopic, and diatom content of lake cores  dated at
              high-resolution by 210Pb and AMS 14C measurements.  A  transect of sites
              ranging from approximately 15o to 20oS in the  eastern cordillera of Bolivia
              will be investigated.  Such a record  of changing effective moisture will
              provide insight into the long-  term climate variability of subtropical South
              America.  Changes in  water resources may have also significantly impacted
              prehistoric  people living on the Altiplano and may again be an important 
              environmental factor for future populations in the region.
