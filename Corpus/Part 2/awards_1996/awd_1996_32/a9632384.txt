              Illinois University at Carbondale    Title:  Dual pressure discharge for
              non-thermal plasma at atmosperic pressure      Abstract    In this research a
              novel discharge for the production of non-thermal plasmas in air at atmospheric
              pressures will be investigated. The design consists of two dielectric barrier
              discharges separated by a UV transparent dielectric.  The UV photons
              pre-ionizes the pressure chamber.  The resulting Avalanches in the high
              pressure region produce a diffused (Townsend-like) discharge.  The UV
              irradiation is timed and efficiently coupled to the atmospheric pressure
              discharge.  The eventual application of this research is in air pollution
              control. The electrical properties of the discharge (onset voltage, power,
              average current, etc.) will be characterized for this goal. The OH radical
              production, which is thought to be the most important radical for oxidation
              applications, will be investigated using laser induced fluorescence in an air
              discharge; and the dual pressure discharge will be investigated for its
              potential to remove SO2 by oxidation in a coal combustion flue gas.
