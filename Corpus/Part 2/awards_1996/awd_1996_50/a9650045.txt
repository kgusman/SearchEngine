Abstract    :
              A growing national awareness indicates that traditional ways of teaching
              chemistry often fail to communicate to students the excitement and intellectual
              challenge of the science experienced by practicing chemists. One emerging model
              that addresses this concern introduces discovery early in the chemistry
              curriculum. Verification experiments where students prove the validity of
              lecture material are replaced by cooperative exercises designed to allow
              students to discover for themselves fundamental concepts of the science. These
              laboratory discoveries then serve as the starting point for lecture
              discussions.               The Department of Chemistry at Centenary College has
              committed itself to this discovery-based method of teaching. Discovery-based
              teaching, especially in organic chemistry, depends extensively on
              instrumentation. This project makes use of a number of simple gas
              chromatographs and integrators in several discovery-based experiments. Organic
              experiments are designed to allow students to investigate the correlation of
              physical properties with structure, and the parameters that govern nucleophilic
              substitution. In addition to these that depend on gas chromatography's power to
              separate and quantitate, the instruments also are being used as preparative
              tools in other experiments.  Finally, the simple, rugged design of the gas
              chromatographs makes it possible to introduce several experiments using this
              instrumentation into the higher enrollment introductory course.
