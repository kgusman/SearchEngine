Abstract    :
               Infrared (IR) analysis is one of the most commonly used analytical methods,
              especially in organic chemistry. A dispersive IR is too slow for use by larger
              classes and is not well adapted for analysis of solid samples. This project
              represents a 10-year emphasis on the improvement of the student laboratory
              experience including increased hands-on use of significant instrumentation. An
              upgrade of the IR instrumentation enhances the quality of the student
              laboratory experience.   The department is incorporating
              Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) based experiments in freshman- through
              senior-level courses. The speed and accuracy of the FTIR allows the performance
              of experiments that were not feasible with a dispersive IR. With the diffuse
              reflectance attachment, solids as well as liquid samples can be analyzed
              readily.   Four new experiments in the freshman-level courses for majors,
              minors, and liberal arts students introduce the freshmen to the FTIR. The major
              program enhancement occurs in organic chemistry, where 14 experiments are being
              enhanced by the use of FTIR analysis of reagents, products, and unknowns. The
              ability to analyze solid samples with IR is a major improvement in the organic
              laboratory. A new polymer kinetics experiment in Physical Chemistry utilizes
              the speed of the FTIR. A quantitative IR experiment with an environmental
              application is being introduced in Instrumental Methods, and a new experiment
              which demonstrates H-bonding effects is being introduced in Biochemistry.   The
              FTIR is also being utilized in the summer research program (SEURP), especially
              in Organic Chemistry projects.
