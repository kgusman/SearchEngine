Abstract    :
               Engineering training in biotechnology requires an understanding of the
              biological process involved and the constraints and requirements of large-scale
              manufacturing. Although many colleges and universities have developed
              successful postbaccalaureate training programs in biotechnology and biochemical
              engineering, similar programs are not available at the introductory
              undergraduate level. By introducing students to the engineering aspects of
              biotechnology at a very early stage (freshmen or sophomore level) the project
              motivates them into acquiring the necessary biology, chemistry, and engineering
              knowledge required for a successful career in biotechnology.   A Biotechnology
              Engineering Laboratory is being established with the goal of developing a group
              of experiments that can be used to exemplify the contribution of engineering to
              biotechnology. Each experimental unit can be used as modules for an
              introductory (freshmen or sophomore) level biotechnology engineering course, or
              the combined group of experiments can be used to teach an upper undergraduate
              or graduate level laboratory course in biotechnology engineering. The
              Biotechnology Laboratory is being used for a variety of purposes:  teaching
              both at the introductory (freshmen and sophomore) and advanced (senior and
              graduate) levels, and research for both undergraduates interested in conducting
              an independent study or a senior research project, and high school students, in
              particular women and minority students, as part of summer internships. The
              project is developing a group of experiments that can be used at all levels,
              from introductory to advanced level courses; to integrate engineering in the
              interdisciplinary teaching of biotechnology that already includes biology and
              chemistry; and to attract students interested in satisfying math/science
              requirements to experience a state-of-the-art engineering laboratory with the
              ultimate purpose of permanently attracting them to a science and engineering
              education.
