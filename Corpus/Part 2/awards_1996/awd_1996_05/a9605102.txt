Abstract    :
              9605102  Herr    To encourage the development of young scientists in the field
              of biology, the Undergraduate Research Program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
              has, since 1959, sponsored undergraduates from various institutions in the U.S.
              for an intensive summer research experience.  The students are housed on the
              Laboratory grounds, and each one is assigned to a permanent Laboratory staff
              member to perform an independent research project in the mentor's field of
              expertise.  Each student begins his or her project with the mentor's close
              guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work independently.  This allows
              students to develop to their full potential and to sample first-hand the
              excitement of experimental science.  During the program the students present
              two series of seminars:  one in which they describe their proposed research and
              one in which the results of each project are summarized.  They attend a series
              of seminars especially for the program given by the Laboratory staff, and may
              also attend lectures in the post-graduate biology courses that are taking place
              concurrently.  This undergraduate research program focuses on the selection of
              individuals who are likely to make a contribution to science in their ensuing
              careers.  Strong emphasis is placed on recruiting minorities.  The success of
              the program is evidenced by the number of past participants who have become
              eminent scientists.
