Abstract    :
               This project addresses two major needs. First, while the university's computing
              power is high and maintained by an excellent Academic Computing staff, use of
              computers for mathematics instruction has been limited to calculus and the
              Computers in Elementary/Middle School Mathematics course. Second, a Concepts of
              Calculus course for prospective middle school teachers has not been taught at
              the university since 1985. This project addresses these needs with the purchase
              of 24 IBM notebook computers, a wheeled rack to store and transport the
              computers, and appropriate software. This computer-lab-on-wheels can be wheeled
              to any classroom in the building. An `Access Point` mounted on the rack allows
              the notebook computers to communicate, by wireless connection, with the campus
              network (LAN), as the Access Point is plugged into a LAN hookup in the wall.
              The computer lab on wheels serves two purposes:  to create widespread (but not
              necessarily intensive) use of computer technology for classroom instruction and
              to be used extensively in the Concepts of Calculus course.    Furthermore, to
              provide `bench lab/hands-on` experiences in the Concepts of Calculus course,
              this project involves purchase of Lego dacta Technology Building Sets and
              Control Labs. This equipment enables students to build working models with
              wheels, gears, and motors that can be controlled by the computer. Data
              acquisition devices on the models send information to the computer for
              analysis. The rack of computers is being housed in the department's Mathematics
              Education Resource Office, where faculty members may check it out for classroom
              use and students may check out computers for use in the office when the rack is
              not being used elsewhere. The paradigm of a shared computer lab on wheels may
              be an attractive solution for many other universities and public schools.
