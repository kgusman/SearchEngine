Abstract    :
              Bansil  9618467    This research will investigate the kinetics of phase 
              separation in physical and chemical gels and pre-gel  branched polymers with
              varying degrees of crosslinking.  The  work with the physical gels will focus
              on the role of  simultaneous phase separation and aggregation/gelation in 
              controlling the morphology of polymeric membranes prepared  either via thermal
              quenching or solvent exchange.  The  studies with chemically crosslinked gels
              will focus on the  effects of network elasticity and crosslinking on the phase 
              separation kinetics via the mechanisms of nucleation and  growth and spinodal
              decomposition.  Theoretical work based  on both linear and non-linear theory of
              spinodal  decomposition kinetics will also be done.  A novel SAXS  experiment
              is proposed to determine the growth in the size  of the precipitated particles
              in order to test the  applicability of nucleation and growth mechanisms which
              are  generally believed to be responsible for the formation of  Liesgang bands
              in gels, and to examine reactions under  conditions where instabilities lead to
              the formation of  stationary patterns, known as Turing patterns.    %%%    This
              work has both fundamental and practical implications,  since phase separation
              mechanisms play an important role in  determining the properties of composite
              materials.  Gels  provide a useful model system to investigate diffusion 
              controlled reactions, which has implications for a wide  range of phenomena in
              chemical and biological systems.    ***
