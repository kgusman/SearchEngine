Abstract    :
              ***  9618722  Marra    The last series of WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP)
              cruises will begin the  North Atlantic in summer, 1997. For JGOFS, the
              collaboration with the WHP  has been for a CO2 survey, and for bio-optics and
              pigments, in order to  obtain a spatially extensive data set on upper ocean
              properties. For the  WHP section A20 (roughly along 55 W from the Grand Banks
              to Trinidad),  data on bio-optical (spectral irradiance, fluorescence, beam
              attenuation,  chlorophyll-a) and physical (temperature, salinity) properties in
              near-  surface waters will be collected at a station spacing of no more than
              100  km.  The objective of this observational program is to determine whether 
              the biogeochemical provinces that have been described for the western  North
              Atlantic have a big-optical basis. The descriptions of the provinces  rely on
              currents, water-column stability, temperature, proximity to land,  etc., but
              are only semi-quantitative. The hypothesis to be tested is  whether these
              provinces exist in a big-optical sense, the null hypothesis  being that there
              are no big-optical differences along the transect beyond  the distinction of
              Case- 1 and Case-2 waters.  Since the cruise will occur  in summer, with
              surface temperature differences at a minimum, the data  collected will be a
              stronger test of the alternative hypothesis (that bio-  optical provinces
              exist) than otherwise.  Once collated and organized, the  data will be made
              available to all investigators via the World-Wide Web.    If biogeochemical
              provinces can be shown to exist as big-optical entities,  it will allow greater
              precision in the calculation of primary production  from satellite imagery, and
              also prove useful in helping to classify ocean  areas with respect to their
              plankton ecology. Biogeochemical provinces are  thus a means or organizing the
              study of the mechanistic basis of plankton  processes. It is expected that the
              WHP cruises will occur after the launch  (now scheduled for February, 1997) of
              the new ocean color sensor, SeaW iFS,  and thus this observational program may
              assist in providing sea-truth for  the satellite data.
