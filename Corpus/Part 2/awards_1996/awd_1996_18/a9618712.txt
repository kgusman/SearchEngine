Abstract    :
              We are able to think about, or construe, a given entity in more  than one way. 
              For example, a given entity may be thought of as a  table, or as some wood. 
              These distinct construals are linked to  the linguistic distinction in English
              between count nouns and  mass nouns.  Thus we can talk of two tables, but not
              two woods,  similarly we can say a little bit of wood, but not a little bit  of
              table.  This is because kinds of objects (e.g. tables) come in  discrete
              amounts, whereas kinds of substances (e.g. wood) come in  continuous amounts. 
              The experiments in this proposal investigate  what factors lead children and
              adults to construe solid entities  as either objects, and thus quantify them
              discretely, or as  substances, and thus quantify them continuously.
              Specifically, we  will be investigating whether cues that suggest that the 
              structure an entity possesses is non-arbitrary (couldn't have  been just any
              other way) lead us to construe it as an object of  some kind, whereas cues that
              suggest that the structure an entity  possesses is arbitrary (could have been
              any other way) lead us to  construe the entity as an amount of solid material
              instead.  It  is expected that in addition to providing important data on how 
              conceptual representations are related to the linguistic  distinction between
              count- and mass nouns, the experiments will  shed light on the nature of
              conceptual representations during  development, and how they are related to
              representations within  other knowledge systems (e.g. systems for representing
              and  reasoning about quantities).
