Abstract    :
              This project will use an array of 18 200MHz Pentium Pro  processors with an
              aggregate memory of 1216 MB to  reconstruct phylogenetic trees from molecular
              data sets that  are too large for analysis by present methods, and to  conduct
              large-scale comparative performance analyses of  competing phylogenetic
              reconstruction algorithms.    Large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions using
              parallel  heuristic methods designed by the grantees are expected to  lead to
              new results in seed plant evolution, and in the most-  parsimonious
              reconstruction of the tree of life.    Large-scale comparative performance
              analyses will explore a  five-dimensional parameter space for data sets of 50
              to 1000  sequences.  These analyses are expected to lead to new  observations
              of the relative strengths and weaknesses of  competing methods and to new
              classes of adversarial  examples.
