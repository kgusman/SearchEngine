Abstract    :
              This dissertation examines how resources, political structure, and collective
              values contribute to different styles of participation in environmental
              decision making in rural communities in the Czech Republic.  It uses several
              theoretical frameworks; resource mobilization, political opportunity structure,
              and framing, and hypothesizes that different levels and combinations of
              resources and opportunities are associated with specific types of political
              behavior: confrontation, institutional mechanisms, and silence.  It maintains
              that values, interests, and beliefs communicated in public presentations
              moderate the predicted relationships.  The fieldwork uses survey and case study
              methods.  Employees of the Institute for Public Opinion Research in the Czech
              Republic will be trained and conduct the interviews.  Data bases and archival
              sources will be used to address relevant demographic variables and supplement
              information collected in the survey.  The information sources will be
              supplemented by qualitative fieldwork, providing a series of comparative case
              studies of proposed developments in locations where community members had
              different reactions to similar proposals.  The dissertation should contribute
              to social theory and public policy, by providing a basis for refining the
              structure of institutions and political processes in order to facilitate
              community participation.
