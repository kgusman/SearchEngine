Abstract    :
              The design of high performance associative memory has long been a goal of
              artificial neural net researchers.  A practical  low-cost device which could
              store and retrieve information similar to the human `content  addressable` 
              memory would be recognition, data base, control systems, and robotics.  Indeed,
              associative memory is seen by most experts as a crucial component for the
              development of any truly intelligent and brain-like system.  The purpose of
              this project is to design and implement a practical and low cost associative
              memory with following properties:  1. High capacity.  2. High amount of error
              correction  and tolerance to noisy or partial inputs.  3.  No spurious memories
              and no limit cycles.  4.  Provision for a `no decision` or ground state.  5.
              Fast memory retrievals.  6. Ability to operate in an autoassociative or
              heteroassociative  mode.  7. Practical and low cost hardware implementation. 
              The approach will be to generalize the operation of the Hamming memory in order
              to design associative memory models which retain all the high performance
              properties of the Hamming net, but allow for a much more practical hardware
              implementation  and faster retrievals.  In particular  the project will explore
              four extensions of the Hamming memory: (i) the Grounded Hamming Memory, (ii)
              the Decoupled  Hamming Memory, (ii) Two Level Decoupled Hamming Memory, and
              (iv) the Cellular Hamming Memory.
