Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9618518    A workshop will be held at the University of Illinois
              Allerton House Conference Center for  April 19-22, 1997 to evaluate the current
              status and to explore future directions of the field of biothermal engineering.
               The program will consist of two and a half days of formal sessions and three
              informal evening discussion periods.  The first evening session will be rather
              informal, except for a keynote speech describing the international picture of
              biothermal engineering.  The first full day will consist of six tutorial
              sessions on the fundamentals as well as the current state of the art of various
              biothermal phenomena from biological, medical, and engineering viewpoints. 
              Each  of these sessions will consist of a lecture followed by a discussion
              period.  In the evenings, following both full day sessions, individual group
              discussions will be held on the topics of the day.  The morning of the second
              full day will be devoted to sub-group discussions of application areas.  In the
              afternoon of the second full day a plenary session will be held to identify the
              major issues for the following discussion sessions.  The sessions of the third
              evening will also be used to develop reports on the individual topics
              discussed.  During the final morning,  plenary session will be held in which
              individual reports will be presented, discussed, and finalized for inclusion in
              the final report.    The final report of the workshop will consist of a summary
              of the discussions and conclusions regarding current status and future work. 
              It will also be presented at various scientific and technical meetings to serve
              as a guide to the researchers, sponsoring agencies, and industry dealing with
              biothermal engineering.  The report will also contain summaries of the keynote
              addresses and a listing of all the participants together with abstracts of
              their current research interests.  ***
