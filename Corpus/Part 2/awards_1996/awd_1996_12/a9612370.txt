Abstract    :
                9612370  Gao    This  multidisciplinary  research  project  addresses  basic 
              materials  synthesis  and processing  research  on  polymers  relevant  to 
              potential photonic applications such  as  full  color  displays; specifically
              the research aims  at  greater  understanding of interface electron transfer in
              polymer  LED  proto-type  structures, including the synthesis, processing, 
              fabrication,  in-situ  and  ex-situ  characterization,   and  molecular
              modeling of such materials and structures.   Using  surface  analytical tools
              the research  will  focus  on  the  morphological and electronic structures,
              chemical reactions,  interdiffusion, and charge transfer of those interfaces
              from  a  microscopic  or atomic viewpoint. The basic  goal  is  to  understand 
              fundamental  mechanisms,  and  to  utilize  this  knowledge  to  demonstrate
              capabilities for high  efficiency  performance  and  longer  lifetimes 
              suitable  for   display  technology.  %%%  The project combines fundamental
              materials chemistry/physics  and    materials    processing   studies    with  
               advanced  characterization  tools  and  analysis  methods  to  address 
              forefront  issues in a topical area, display technology,  of  high  scientific
              value and potential technological benefits.  The   research  will  contribute 
              basic  materials   science  knowledge  at  a  fundamental level to  several 
              aspects  of  advanced    polymer    light   emitting    structures    and 
              Configurations.  The knowledge and understanding gained from  this research
              project is expected to contribute in a general  way to improving the
              performance of advanced display devices  by  providing a fundamental
              understanding and  a  basis  for  designing  and  producing improved materials,
              and  materials  processing  routes.  An important feature of the program  is 
              the  integration  of  research  and  education  through  the  training  of
              students in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area.  ***
