Abstract    :
              9612022  Liu   Hard turning is an attractive alternative to the conventional
              precision machining practice of forming, turning, hardening, grinding and
              superfinishing, because several process steps can be eliminated.  However,
              achieving this attractive result has been limited by lack of knowledge and the
              risk of thermal damage and residual stresses.  This project's objectives are to
              understand and model: how pre-existing residual stresses affect subsequent
              residual stresses and chip formation, and how cutting conditions and the ratio
              of feed to depth of cut affect residual stresses.  This investigation will
              involve both mathematical modeling and experiment.  An experimental design
              matrix, replicated twice,  will be used to assess the effects of 3 levels of
              flank wear, 2 feeds, two depths of cut, 2 cutting speeds and 2 tool nose radii.
               X-ray diffraction will be used to measure residual stress, and the
              experimental method of Tay et. al. used to determine temperature distributions.
              This will be complemented by a modeling effort using the finite element method
              to predict residual stresses based on a thermal-mechanical model of machining. 
                    Success in this project potentially eliminates lengthy and costly
              operations like finish grinding and superfinishing, in the production of
              precision components like bearings.  This means higher productivity while
              maintaining quality.
