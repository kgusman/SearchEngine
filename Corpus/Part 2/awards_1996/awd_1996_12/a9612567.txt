Abstract    :
              Proposal #:     ECS-9612567    PI Name/Institution:            Gregory
              Washington/ Ohio State University    The referenced African American PI in his
              first year as faculty at Ohio State University has requested Research Planning
              Grant funds to initiate a program to develop a novel class of adaptive aperture
              antennas based on piezoelectric film distributed actuators.  Piezoelectric
              films are one example of "smart materials".  This work if successful will truly
              revolutionize imaging techniques in aperture antennas, with possible
              ramifications for medical imaging.  This is an excellent and carefully detailed
              proposal which focuses on a proof of concept theoretical and experimental
              design involving three steps:  (1) Modeling to correlate the surface shape with
              the radiation pattern. This will provide strong support for concept viability
              in future proposals. The proposed modeling is an extension of original work
              which the PI has already published.  (2) Active antenna fabrication:  The
              central problem involves bonding of the piezoelectric film to an acceptable
              substrate and this will be the focus of this section.  Methods which are
              scaleable to industry are emphasized.  (3) Antenna surface deflection testing. 
              This will provide strong experimental verification of concept viability.   
              Successful completion of the above three steps will provide a very strong
              foundation for a future proposal.   A good knowledge and selection of crucial
              topics is evidenced by the PI.   Resources provided by Ohio State University
              are also excellent.  I strongly recommend funding at the proposed amount of
              $17,970.00.
