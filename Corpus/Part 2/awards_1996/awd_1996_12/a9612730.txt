Abstract    :
              This new research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program,  focusses on studies of model lipid bilayers and actual biomembranes. 
              During the tenure of  this three-year continuing grant, Professor Robert Dunn
              and his students at the University of  Kansas will examine nanometric domains
              of membrane bound proteins using a variety of  microscopic methods. These
              techniques include confocal optical microscopy, scanning force  microscopy, and
              near field scanning optical microscopy.  The goals of this research are to  use
              these methods to identify and characterize these nanometric lipid domains and
              to  investigate the effect of bending strain on protein reactivity in these
              model membrane  systems.  Actual biomembranes derived from soybean protoplast
              will also be examined, and  attempts will be made to identify active lipid
              microdomains in these materials.  The function of small protein domains in
              biological membranes is not fully understood.   Using a combination of state of
              the art surface microscopy techniques, Professor Dunn will  identify and
              characterize these domains in both model lipid bilayers and actual biomembranes
               derived from soybeans.  An understanding of the structure and function of
              these protein  domains will be very useful in the subsequent rational design of
              membrane biosensors, in  addition to increasing our understanding of protein
              function in membrane systems.
