Abstract    :
              9612880  Farlow     In what morphological features, and at what taxonomic level,
              would tridactyl (three-toed) footprints likely vary across different groups of
              bipedal dinosaurs?  Because we cannot observe footprint formation by living,
              non-avian dinosaurs, it is proposed to investigate these questions indirectly,
              through inter-related analyses of within-taxon and across-taxon morphological
              variability in:  a)  hindfoot and toebone proportions in dinosaurs and ground
              birds;  b)  footprint shape in ground birds;  c)  skeletal and "fleshy" foot
              proportions in crocodilians.   Morphometric analyses of foot and footprint
              shape will be employed to address the question of how different footprints can
              be, and still have been made by the same kind of taxon and how similar prints
              can be, and yet have been made by different taxa.  Each component of the
              project addresses a different aspect of the problem of interpreting the
              diversity of animals responsible for dinosaur fooprint faunas, and each
              addresses shortcomings I the other approaches.  Together they will provide a
              theoretical framework upon which to base systematic interpretations of
              tridactyl dinosaur footprints.  Results of these studies will be used to
              interpret the ichnotaxonomy of tridactyl dinosaur footprints from Early
              Cretaceous rocks of Texas.
