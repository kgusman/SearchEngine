Abstract    :
              9612427  Bustoz    Bustoz is Professor of Mathematics at the Arizona State
              University.  One  of 27 Mexican American Ph.D. holders in the Nation in
              Mathematics, Bustoz  has demonstrated outstanding breadth and depth in
              improving mathematics  and science education for underrepresented students. He
              has established  and/or provided:      Mentoring programs for underrepresented
              minority precollege students    living in urban areas and on Arizona
              reservations to study mathematics    -- his outreach has grown from ten (10)
              students in 1985 to currently    over 200 minority students participating in
              the ASU Mathematics/Science    Honors Program (MSHP)each summer, with over
              1,000 students having    completed MSHP since 1985;      Significant individual
              and institutional impact -- one-third of    mathematics majors at Arizona State
              University are minorities    (primarily Native Americans and Hispanics), an
              unusually high rate,    especially since 86% of the students are non-minority;
              ASU now leads    the nation in the number of minority mathematics majors;
              approximately    one-half of his students have obtained degrees in mathematics,
              science,    or engineering fields; from the initial effort with MSHP, Bustoz
              has    created additional outreach programs that are now housed collectively   
              in the Institute for Strengthening Math and Science  SUMS )      Enhancement
              programs for American Indian teachers and teacher aides --    e.g. Pimas and
              Papagos Gila River Indian Reservation, and Navajos from    Window Rock where he
              directs a Young Scholars Project, now in its    seventh year;        Activities
              to increase the ranks of minority teachers, such as    encouraged use of
              Arizona s Alternative Certification -- approximately    10 minority mathematics
              majors enter the teaching profession annually    and return to the high schools
              from which they graduated, including    some of the lowest income schools in
              Phoenix;        Role models for Spanish-speaking students -- by bringing
              Spanish-    speaking mathematicia ns and graduate students from the U.S. and
              abroad    to study and teach at ASU;        Technical advice to mathematicians
              to replicate and adapt his work,    e.g., replication of MSHP in South Dakota,
              where recruitment from a    nearby Sioux Reservation takes place; and       
              Advice to launch the Strengthening Underrepresented Minorities in   
              Mathematics Program of the Mathematics Association of America.               
              9612398  Gutierrez    Gutierrez is Professor of Chemistry and Director of both
              the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) Minority Access to Research Careers
              (MARC) and  the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) Programs at
              California  State University at Los Angeles. His accomplishments include:      
               Significant impact on minority student college and university education   
              through his work on NIH funded projects -- over 180 students mentored    by him
              through these programs or his role as a faculty participant in    other
              department projects such as the NSF Research Improvement in    Minority
              Institutions (RIMI) and Research Experiences for    Undergraduates (REU)
              Programs;        Significant institutional impact -- the American Chemical
              Society    (ACS), in great part through his effort, established the Committee
              on    Minority Affairs in 1993 with Gutierrez serving as its first chair,   
              which in turn established the ACS Minority Scholars Program, a $5    million
              scholarship program for undergraduates; and the establishment    of the ACS
              Award for Encouraging Disadvantaged Students to Pursue    Careers in Chemical
              Sciences.    -- as Vice Chair of the National Academy of Science Committee on a
                 National Scholars Program, under contract to NASA, he has articulated   
              persuasively the responsibility of all faculty, but especially science   
              faculty, to seek out talented minority students and encourage their    academic
              development very early in their undergraduate career; and        Beyond
              individual students, Gutierrez has effected an entire cohort of    future
              science  professionals.                                                 
              9612453  Bagayoko    Bagayoko is Professor of Physics and Chancellor s Fellow
              at Southern  University. His accomplishments include:      Establishment of the
              Timbuktu Academy, which has a summer program for    100 plus middle and high
              school students annually and an academic year    program for undergraduates,
              and is nationally recognized as an    exceptional program for mentoring
              minority students in SEM disciplines    -- Bagayoko has intensively mentored
              over 200 students through the    Physics Department and the Academy since his
              arrival at Southern in     1984;        Demonstrable student outcomes -- among
              Academy students, two have    received the University s highest academic
              awards, University Grand     Marshals; two have received Ph.D.s in Physics and
              five others are    completing their Ph.D.; 10 students have received the M.S.
              degree in    Physics;  many of these students are themselves making meaningful 
                contributions to science and society;        Significant institutional impact
              and replicability -- started in    Physics, the Academy program has expanded to
              Chemistry and Engineering;    while Southern is a predominantly Black
              institution, students from a    variety of backgrounds have been included and
              succeeded in his program,    e.g., Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian; and       
              Strong testimonials from current graduate students about the influence    of
              Bagayoko personally and the Academy program on their academic and    career
              pursuits.                                                  9612399  Herman   
              Herman is Associate Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University  of
              Virginia and has established herself firmly as a role model and mentor  for
              geoscientists and geoscience educators at her home institution and  more
              broadly. Nominated by the Association of Women in Science, her  accomplishments
              include:      Advising approximately 55 students of which 40% are women, four
              of whom    were mentored to the Ph. D. level, 17 to the M.S. level, and two at
              the    B.S./B.A. level;        An excellent publication record in environmental
              geochemistry, strong    service on a number of national committees and on
              several editorial     boards;  emphasis of research experience in her mentoring
              of women and    minority students;        Innovative science teaching
              approaches at all levels -- has developed    an effective videotape aimed at
              helping Earth Science teachers cover    the topic of Groundwater effectively;
              is a resource for geoscience    education for much of the primary school system
              in Charlottesville and    surrounding counties;        Creation of the Program
              for Interdisciplinary Research in Contaminant    Hydrogeology (PIRCH), which
              has resulted in significant NSF Traineeship    and University of Virginia
              Academic Enhancement Program support,    especially for women and minority
              graduate students; and        Strong letters of support from students.
