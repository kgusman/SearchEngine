Abstract    :
              This project will partially support the research visits of          U.S.
              scholars in the mathematical sciences to the Institut des      Hautes Etudes
              Scientifiques (IHES) in Bures-sur-Yvette, France.     This international
              institute is comparable to the Institute for     Advanced Study in Princeton,
              New Jersey and, in addition to         support from the National Science
              Foundation, is supported in       part by science agencies in a number of other
              countries.            Areas of research at the IHES include algebraic geometry,
                        number theory, combinatorics, group representations, harmonic      
              analysis, convex sets and analysis, geometry, and topology,        
              differential geometry, dynamical systems, and ergodic theory.
