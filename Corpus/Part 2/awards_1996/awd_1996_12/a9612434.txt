Abstract    :
              9612434  Smith    Smith is currently Professor of Science Education in the
              Department  of Curricular and Instructional Studies at the University of Akron 
              and his career has focused on mentoring underrepresented groups,  especially
              women and Native Americans. His accomplishments include:       o Serving
              effectively as perhaps the nation s first male Associate    Dean of Women at
              the University of Kansas;    o Producing COMETS, a widely respected curriculum
              to encourage  girls     in grades 5-9 to pursue careers in science; over 8000 
              copies of      this National Science Teachers Association (NSTA)  publication
              are     used around the world; COMETS has also received  an AERA award; has 
              produced curriculum materials, also published  by NSTA, to    encourage senior
              high and undergraduate women in  science;    o Producing curriculum for use by
              Native American students,    conducting research in the same area, and leading
              workshops for    over 750 teachers;     o Serving as mentor and advisor to many
              Native American teachers,    including 32 MASTERS science teachers, half of
              whom are Native    American; these mentees have developed programs like TIPS   
              (Teaching in Pueblo Schools) where senior high students from    Sante Fe Indian
              School returned to their home schools as cross-    age tutors to teach science
              from a native American perspective    to younger siblings;      o Directly
              impacting graduate and undergraduate minority students.    One of his doctoral
              students, a Cherokee, is President of    Haskell Indian Nations University in
              Kansas; and three have    received Presidential Awards for Excellence in
              Science and    Mathematics Teaching; and      o Receiving the National Science
              Teachers Association (NSTA)    Distinguished Service Award for Education.
