Abstract    :
              9612112  Duncan  This project is for a continuation of research into the origin
              and evolution of the world's largest oceanic plateau, the Ontong Java Plateau
              (OJP) in the SW Pacific.  Previously funded study, complementing work on
              submarine OJP lavas drilled by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), focused on
              plateau basement sections on Santa Isabel and Malaita, Solomon Islands.  This
              research involves the following tasks.  FIELDWORK:  Detailed, stratigraphically
              controlled sampling in south and southeastern Makira, in what is expected to be
              the deepest part of the Makiran section.  40Ar-39Ar  DATING:  Dating of samples
              from throughout the Makiran section is required to determine if 90 Ma and/or
              122 Ma lavas are present, and to establish the significance and thickness of
              the    34 Ma and    64 Ma events.   GEOCHEMISTRY AND PETROGRAPHY:  Systematic
              major and trace element, and Nd-Pb-Sr isotopic analyses are required to define
              Makiran geochemical stratigraphy; in particular, the geochemical variation of
              OJP-type lavas with depth, the nature and stratigraphic extent of the broadly
              MORB-like basalts, and the nature and causes of intercalation of the two types.
               PLATINUM GROUP ELEMENTS (PGEs):  Results from previous study show that lavas
              from Malaita and ODP drill sites are enriched in the siderophile elements W and
              Mo, and may indicate a core-mantle boundary origin for the OJP's mantle source.
               Further evaluation of this hypotheses requires determination of abundances of
              the ultra-siderophilic PGEs for a subset of  OJP lavas.
