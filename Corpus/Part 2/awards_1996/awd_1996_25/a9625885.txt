Abstract    :
              First-principle electronic structure calculations have proven to be a very
              powerful and accurate tool for investigating the properties of matter at
              microscopic scales, where they extend or complement the domain of experiments. 
              Their strength comes from the precision and predictive power that is inherent
              in a parameter-free quantum-mechanical approach, from the fine level of detail
              of the spatial and temporal description they provide at the atomic level, and
              from the recent expansion in the availability of powerful computational
              resources.  However, the time needed to solve a given system using conventional
              implementations of these methods is proportional to the third power of the
              number of atoms, thus preventing the extension of this otherwise extremely
              successful approach to a great many systems of interest.  This limitation is
              algorithmic in nature; the physics and its associated complexity inherently
              scale linearly with the number of atoms.  The project will implement and test a
              new algorithm which holds the promise of providing a computational scheme of
              comparable accuracy, but which scales only linearly with system size.  This
              scheme is built implicitly on the physical localization of the one-particle
              density matrix.  This same localizational property makes such an algorithm
              highly appropriate for implementation on a massively parallel computer
              architecture.
