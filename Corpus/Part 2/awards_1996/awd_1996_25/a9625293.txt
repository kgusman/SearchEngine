Abstract    :
              9625293  Reimanis    A coordinated teaching and research program that targets 
              several national critical needs in the semiconductor and the  structural
              ceramics industries will be implemented.  The  educational component will
              emphasize materials selection in  design and will develop the integration of
              computer-based  design and/or numerical modeling into several undergraduate 
              classes in materials science.   The research aspect of the  program will
              examine relationships between the residual  stress distribution and the
              fracture behavior in graded  composites. Graded composites represent a new
              class of  materials in the sense that many of their properties can not  be
              predicted with existing scientific models. One of the  P.I.'s long term goals
              is to develop some of these models.  The effect of the size scale of the
              microstructure relative  to gradation on mechanical properties will be examined
              by  synthesizing composites with different graded layer  thicknesses and
              different gradation architectures employing  vapor deposition, and powder
              metallurgy. Both thermal and  mechanical loading will be used to examine
              failure  mechanisms. Crack trajectories will be observed so that  fracture
              criteria may be developed.  %%%  The proposed research plan of this CAREER
              proposal is to  develop an understanding of the failure mechanisms in 
              metal/ceramic composites and coatings that are  compositionally graded. 
              Understanding these mechanisms will  enable materials engineers to design
              better advanced  materials for the automotive and aerospace industries.  ***
