              Engineering Science:  High Performance Computing for Remote Sensing
              Applications    This award supports CES associate David Bader.  The main
              objective of the proposed training and research plan is to develop innovative
              computational methods and software for applying high performance computing to
              fundamental problems arising in the analysis of remotely sensed image data. 
              This work will be conducted at the University of Maryland Institute for
              Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) in close cooperation with Professor Davis
              (Computer Science), Goward (Geography), Ja'Ja' (Electrical Engineering), and
              Townshend (Geography), who are pursuing a number of closely related efforts. 
              The application to be developed is a high performance system for estimating net
              primary production (NPP) using the production efficiency model (PEM) developed
              at the University of Maryland.  The overall aim is to build a family of
              software modules that make use of a variety of algorithms to carry out
              geometric correction of images, to eliminate signals from extraneous sources
              (e.g. atmospheric correction), to sample spatially and temporally, and to
              generate derived geophysical properties.  The modules will be constructed using
              proven portable and practical high performance programming languages and
              libraries.  Our applications development will be conducted on two high
              performance computing platforms at UMIACS; a 16-node IBM SP-2 and a Digital
              Alpha cluster consisting of 40 Alpha processors networked via a Digital ATM
              Gigaswitch.  The Maryland facility has approximately 300GB of online disk
              storage and a multi-terabyte tertiary storage system.  ***
