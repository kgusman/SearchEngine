Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to advance the state-of-the-  art in
              language-based tools for software engineering. There  are three related aspects
              to the research: (1) extending  dependence-graph-based tools, (2) carrying out
              theoretical  and practical studies of pointer analysis, and (3)  quantifying
              trade-offs in dataflow analysis.    The work builds on the prior research in
              two areas: the  design and implementation of software engineering tools, and 
              the design, implementation and evaluation of algorithms for  dataflow analysis.
               The first part of the work includes the  continuation of previous
              NSF-supported research extending  underlying theory to permit graph-based tools
              to be used for  a wider range of languages than is currently possible, and 
              improving existing graph based tools. It also includes  new directions: the
              design and implementation of new tools  using a hybrid approach that combines
              text or syntax-based  tools with semantic checks.    The research on pointer
              analysis and dataflow analysis  tradeoffs is complementary to the work on
              dependence graphs,  since the results are expected to improve the graph-based 
              tools. They are also expected to be useful to other  researchers and
              practitioners concerned with applications  that rely on the results of static
              analysis.  ***
