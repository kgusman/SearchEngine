Abstract    :
              The temporal dynamics of information processing in the brain can be studied
              using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalpgrahpy (MEG), but the
              spatial resolution of these techniques is often poor due to crude mathematical
              models.  Accuracy and resolution can be improved by using finite elements to
              model the realistic geometry and electrical conductivity of the head and grain.
                A 2D EEG source localization code based on a finite element method has been
              developed, but extending this to the 3D realistic-shaped head model will
              require a huge increase in computational speed.  Source localization in a 3D
              finite element model requires the solution of a large system of equations (more
              than 100,000) for hundreds of iterations for each time point in a brainwave
              that may last for seconds.  Therefore, to make this computations practicable
              the 3D EEG code will be optimized and parallelized to run on one of the CRAY
              supercomputers at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center or on a cluster of 80
              Hewlett-Packard workstations at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
              During the second year, a 3D MEG source localization code will be developed and
              parallelized. This is a straightforward and relatively simple task once the 3D
              EEG code is parallelized, because the solution of the same system of equations
              is needed for both EEG and MEG.  The fellowship will help broaden the research
              Associate's knowledge in code optimization, code parallelization and the
              neurosciences through participation in formal courses, workshops, seminars and
              consultation with a group of multi-disciplinary advisops in computer science,
              mathematics, neurophysiology  and engineering. The code developed from this
              project will be made available through the domain to help other researchers
              utilize accurate and efficient source localization models.
