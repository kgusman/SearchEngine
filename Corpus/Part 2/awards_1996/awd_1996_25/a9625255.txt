Abstract    :
              This investigation builds new statistical artificial intelligence  and   
              reinforcement   learning   techniques   for    large-scale  manufacturing 
              operations.  The primary  scientific  question  it  attacks  is:  How  can
              machine learning be used to  automate  the  decisions   that   a  process 
              engineer  makes   in   monitoring,  optimizing,  and  fine tuning processes?  
              The  products  of  the  research   are   new   algorithms  for   memory-based  
              learning.  Innovations  include Bayesian locally weighted  regression,  Fast 
              real-time  learning response by means of multiresolution  memory-  base 
              structures,  novel model-selection search  algorithms,  and  experiment  design
              methodologies for memory-based  approximators.  In  parallel with their
              development, these algorithms  are  being  tested  and  deployed through
              several joint projects between  the  principal investigator's research group at
              CMU and two  large  US  manufacturing  companies. The economic impact  of  this
               research  will   be   processes  and  factories  that  analyse  their   own 
              datastreams in real time, develop increasingly improved models of  themselves,
              and exploit those models.
