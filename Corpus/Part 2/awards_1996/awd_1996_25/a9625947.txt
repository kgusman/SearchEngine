Abstract    :
              9625947  Scharberg    This project continues the tradition of the prior teacher
              in-  service programs associated with the Biennial Conferences on  Chemical
              Education sponsored by the Division of Chemical Education  of the American
              Chemical Society.  Because the location of the  Biennial Conference changes
              from year to year the target group also  changes and consists of those teachers
              of chemistry within a 3-4  hour driving time of the conference.  The up-coming
              conference will  be held at Clemson University.  The project will serve 55 
              participants and especially those teachers who are (1) teaching out  of field;
              (2) professionally or geographically isolated; (3) and  teaching large numbers
              of underrepresented students.  The major  goals of the proposal are to
              stimulate and encourage these teachers  to join professional groups, to
              participate in a regional network  dedicated to issues in chemical education,
              to become involved in  the mainstream of chemical education and thus to
              participate in the  national movement to improve science education at the high
              school  level.  The teachers in the project will be involved in an  intensive
              series of workshops before during and after the Biennial  Conference.  They are
              also expected to attend the Conference  Sessions and two follow-up sessions six
              months apart.  Ten Lead  Teachers from the region, selected on the basis of
              their  demonstrated excellence in teaching and professional development 
              history will lead the Operation Progress workshops, serve as  mentors and
              information sources to the participants and manage the  networking component of
              the program.  Matching funds constitute about 315% of the NSF grant.
