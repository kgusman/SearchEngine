Abstract    :
              9625919  Chan    X-ray scattering provides an extremely powerful probe of the 
              microscopic properties of condensed materials systems.  The  proposed 3He
              refrigeration system and associated electronics  and gas handling components
              will allow us to apply X-ray  scattering techniques to materials systems at low
               temperatures, in particular quantum liquids.  Such  capabilities are not
              available at any synchrotron x-ray  source in the world.  Thus, this 3He
              refrigeration system  will provide a unique and valuable facility.  The
              proposed  refrigeration system will be initially used for the study of 
              disorder and impurities in helium mixtures.  This disorder  can be introduced
              either through the introduction of  annealed impurities, such as 3He in 4He, or
              confinement in  porous glasses, such as vycor or aerogel, or both.  The 
              presence of disorder can have profound effects on the  critical behavior,
              transport properties and phase separation  of 3He-4He mixtures.  It can also
              modify the microscopic  structure, as reflected in the pair correlation
              function of  the atoms.  The research studies will directly address these 
              microscopic issues using x-ray scattering.  The research  will make use of
              either the National Synchrotron Light  Source currently operating at Brookhaven
              National Laboratory  or the Advanced Photon source which is under construction
              at  Argonne National Laboratory.  The proposed refrigeration  system will be
              designed with sufficient flexibility to allow  it to be used on a variety of
              instruments at either of these  sources.  %%%  This project will have broad
              scientific impact to the field  of low temperature materials research and will
              provide  unique capability to the important area of x-ray scattering  for the
              advancement of characterization of materials of  economic importance.  ***
