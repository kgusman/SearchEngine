Abstract    :
              Watson  9626968  The investigator derives global convergence theorems and
              develops  practical numerical algorithms with high quality mathematical 
              software for probability-one homotopies in the areas of  constrained
              optimization, large sparse unstructured systems of  nonlinear equations,
              polynomial systems of equations, and various  disturbance rejection controls. 
              The emphasis is on useful  convergence theorems expressed in terms of
              conditions on the  original problem rather than conditions on the derived
              problem.   Important applications in control systems design and 
              multidisciplinary design optimization are used to guide the  theoretical
              investigations.  The mathematical software uses the  existing curve tracking
              kernels in HOMPACK, leveraging HOMPACK to  build application-specific shells. 
              Realistic models of physical phenomena are typically large and  nonlinear. 
              Solving the large nonlinear systems of equations  resulting from such models
              requires new algorithms, and some  recently developed homotopy algorithms have
              been successfully  applied to problems in circuit simulation, aircraft design 
              optimization, composite material design, control system  synthesis, and
              manufacturing mechanism design.  This work studies  the theoretical properties
              of these new homotopy algorithms, and  develops practical, high quality
              mathematical software  that provides a useful tool for engineers and
              scientists.
