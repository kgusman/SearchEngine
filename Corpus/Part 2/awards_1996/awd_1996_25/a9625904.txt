Abstract    :
              The integrated design of aerodynamic, structural, and control systems is
              essential to the development of new commercial aircraft.  The validation of
              such a design by numerical simulations requires solving simultaneously the
              appropriately coupled fluid, structural, and control equations of motion.
              Consequently, the numerical simulation of an integrated aircraft design is
              computationally intensive.  They propose to develop high performance
              computational methodologies for addressing such challenging problems, and apply
               them to the investigation of an Oblique Flying Wing (OFW) and a Corporate
              Supersonic Transport (CST).  The OFW is of great interest because it
              corresponds to an optimum aerodynamic and structural combination, and offers
              speed and large size.  Moreover its control is likely to be most challenging. 
              On the other hand, the CST is perhaps the first civilian supersonic aircraft
              that will be built after the Concorde.  While the control of the CST can be
              expected to be less difficult than that of the OFW, it will still demand
              considerable computational resources.  The proposed research is
              multidisciplinary and includes several components: computational fluid
              dynamics, computational structural mechanics, dynamics and active control, as
              well as applied mathematics, numerical analysis, computer science, and parallel
              processing.  The proposed research will be carried out primarily by Dr. Pei Li,
              under the supervision of Professor Farhat, with the assistance of Professors
              Seebass and Lawrence.  The necessary training in computational methods and
              parallel processing, and the needed computer resources will be provided.
