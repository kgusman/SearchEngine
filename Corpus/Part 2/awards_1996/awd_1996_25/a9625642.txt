Abstract    :
              9625642 Zheng  ABSTRACT   The investigator will continue the study of diffusion
              process related to heat propagation in a composite medium. The proposed
              research is related to several areas of probability theory:  the theory of
              Dirichlet forms and Markov processes, weak convergence theory, stochastic
              calculus and martingale theory. The investigator is mainly interested in the
              following problems:    1) Time-dependent Dirichlet form and moving boundary
              problems;    2) The analysis of the Markov chain models which give
              approximating solutions for the above problems;     3) The estimate of the rate
              of weak convergence when a sequence of Markov chains approach a diffusion
              process. The investigator expects that this proposed study will introduce more
              applications of the existing results of diffusion process theory thereby
              enriching the whole theory.      The main purpose of this investigation is to
              study problems related to the temperature evolution of an object composed of
              several different materials. Two examples are the melting-freezing process of
              ice hills on the oceans and temperature control inside a nuclear reactor. For
              those problems, the real computations are very complicated and sometimes
              applied scientists do not even know if their computational result is precise
              enough to the applicable to the real world.  The investigator will use a
              special mathematical model known as "diffusion processes" to simulate the real
              temperature evolution on those objects. Moreover, the investigator  will study
              how to realize this process on a computer and how accurate the computer
              simulation result will be.
