Abstract    :
              9625945  Kuzyk    This proposal seeks partial funding for an international
              conference on the  topic of organic nonlinear optics with meeting headquarters
              on Marco  Island, Florida. Travel funds are requested to support U.S. invited 
              speakers and students. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together top 
              researchers - whose expertise spans material design, material 
              characterization, device fabrication, and integrated device architectures -  to
              the captive setting of a small island to discuss and assess progress in  the
              field. This upcoming conference is motivated by 3 previous  NSF-supported
              conferences that were held in Pullman, Washington in the  summer of 1992; in
              Val Thorens, France in the Winter of 1994 (ICONO'1); and  in Kusatsu, Japan in
              the Summer of 1995(ICONO'2). This proposed meeting  would be the fourth in the
              series of meetings that are held every 18  months. The demand for such a
              meeting was evidenced by full-capacity  attendance at both ICONO'1 and ICONO'2.
              The strategy is to hold this  meeting in those countries that are active in
              organic nonlinear optics. At  the ICONO'1 meeting, U.S. and other non-European
              attendees had the  opportunity to learn about a large array of European
              research activities  that are normally not represented at U.S. conferences.
              Similarly, at  ICONO'2, Pacific Rim research was show-cased. NSF supported
              students  attended both conferences. The aim of this meeting is to bring
              together  this group of internationally distinguished researchers to a forum in
              the  United States that encourages discussion and interactions.  ***
