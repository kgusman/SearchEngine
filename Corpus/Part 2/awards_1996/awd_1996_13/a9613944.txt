Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting   Professor
              Davidson at Indiana University.  Over the next three years he   will continue
              his development and application of new methodologies in the   field of quantum
              chemistry for the purpose of understanding the very   fundamental inner
              workings of molecules.  The major focus of this   theoretical research is in
              the area of multi-reference perturbation   theory.  Another aspect of this work
              involves the development of an   alternative formulation of open shell density
              functional theory.  This   research will also continue investigations of a
              number of chemical   systems, particularly of unstable forms of molecules. 
              Computational chemistry has become very proficient at describing the  
              properties of stable species.  Chemical reactions of hot molecules are   much
              more difficult to describe because the electrons in a reacting   molecule are
              often distributed in ways that differ greatly from their   behavior in stable
              molecules.  Application of many standard computational   methods often provides
              inaccurate and misleading predictions for reacting   molecules.  This research
              aims to improve methods designed to follow   chemical reactions and to predict
              their outcomes.  This requires   developing methods that apply to fragments of
              molecules and to molecules   with partially broken bonds.  These methods will
              be tested by   collaborating with experimental research groups that have
              compiled some   information for a few well chosen reactions.
