Abstract    :
              9613342  Lynd    The proposed research will address conversion of waste paper 
              sludge to ethanol and recyclable minerals.   Potential  benefits derived
              include: diverting a significant industrial  waste into a useful product;
              improving both the cost  effectiveness and environmental impact of paper
              recycling;  raising the cost-effectiveness of ethanol production and  mineral
              recovery from paper sludge relative to either of  these endeavors undertaken
              alone; improving the technical  feasibility of recovering and reusing minerals
              from paper  sludge; providing a entry point and proving ground for the 
              emergent biomass ethanol industry.    Research is proposed that builds upon an
              extensive data base  on paper sludge composition and convertibility to ethanol 
              assembled by the P.I.  Proposed tasks will characterize,  improve and evaluate:
               --continuous simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  (SSF) for
              conversion of pretreated and non-pretreated paper  sludges to ethanol.  --use
              of Trichoderma reesei for the production of cellulase  from paper-sludge for
              use in an SSF system.  --use of thermophilic bacteria for continuous conversion
              of  paper sludge to ethanol.  --liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment as a means
              to increase  the fraction of paper sludges that exhibit high conversion  to
              ethanol  and  --Perform measurements on mineral residues pursuant to 
              evaluating their amenability to recycling.
