Abstract    :
              In the ongoing debate over how to mitigate against long-term pollution threats
              (e.g., climate change, accumulative water pollutants) and promote long-term
              sustainable economic development, all sides agree on the importance of
              developing and disseminating new environmentally-friendly technologies. There
              is a significant debate over how this is best done, with many economists
              advocating the establishing the use of broad environmental performance
              standards and economic incentives for environmental protection that will induce
              technical change, while others advocate a more proactive government role in
              inducing the use of green technologies. For the most part, the conceptual part
              of this debate has been engaged using fairly simple analytical frameworks that
              do not encompass a number of important stylized facts: (i) the process of
              environmental degradation is dynamic, as is the switchover to new technology;
              (ii) there are uncertainties and irreversibilities surrounding both the
              accumulation of ecological damages and the costs of new technologies; and (iii)
              both environmental degradation and technical change may exhibit nonconvexities
              (threshold effects, multiple ecological equilibria, and lumpy technology
              transition costs) that complicate the identification of a socially efficient
              path and the realization of such a path in practice through appropriate policy.
              In particular, a policy of simply `getting prices right` with respect to
              environmental damages may not succeed in inducing a socially efficient
              investment path with nonconvexities and irreversibilities.  The objective of
              this research is to expand understanding of these issues by extending existing
              dynamic models of production, investment, and pollution accumulation. Of
              particular interest is the extent to which efficient outcomes are realizable or
              can be approximated in practice given a limited number of relatively `clumsy`
              policy tools that are available in practice (e.g., it is impossible to
              implement complex dynamically optimal pollution tax paths). The research will
              consider both the properties of socially efficient outcomes under conditions of
              irreversibility and nonconvexity, and the extent to which pollution
              internalization policies (e.g., emissions permits systems) need to be
              dovetailed with other policies (e.g., information campaigns, demonstration
              programs, and subsidies for initial investments in new technology) to overcome
              sunk cost barriers to the adoption of socially efficient new products and
              processes, particularly if there are multiple potential socially efficient
              outcomes. In addressing uncertainty and irreversibility, the research also will
              use recent theoretical advances in valuing `technology options` to address how
              the value of waiting versus investing is affected by nonconvexities. The
              research thus should contribute to an increased capacity for assessing
              obstacles to the green technology transition, and the performance of
              alternative policies in addressing problems such as climate change,
              accumulative pollutants like methyl bromide and other ozone depletors, and the
              protection of water bodies from accumulative pollutants, among other cases.
