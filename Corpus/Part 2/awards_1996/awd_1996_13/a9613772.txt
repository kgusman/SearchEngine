              Title: Atmosphere and Ocean During TOGA-COARE: Study of Multiscale 
              Interactions Between Convective Systems, Ocean Temperature, and  Intraseasonal
              Oscillations    The research supported by the grant helps in understanding what
               mechanisms controls the movement of the eastward propagating  tropical cloud
              clusters and precipitation regions.  These moving  large scale precipitation
              patterns are some of the pronounced  signals in the tropical climate.  They are
              associated with what is  know as Maden-Julien Oscillation (MJO) which is an
              intra seasonal  oscillation in the tropical circulation.  The research proposed
              is  to study the mutual interaction between the equatorial convection  and the
              Sea Surface Temperature (SST) on intra-seasonal time  scales.  The hypothesis
              labeled ASCII to be tested is that the SST  gradients generated in response to
              atmospheric convection,  influence the propagation and development of cloud
              clusters  associated with the MJO.
