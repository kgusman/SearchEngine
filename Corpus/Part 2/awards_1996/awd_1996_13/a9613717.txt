Abstract    :
              AST 96-13717. California Institute of Technology. PI: N. Z.   Scoville   
              Astronomical Research with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array    This award
              supports research, technological development and   student education at the
              California Institute of Technology's   Owens Valley millimeter array. The array
              is made up of 6 precision   10.4m-diameter antennas, which currently can be
              positioned out to   maximum spacings of 220m north-south and 200m east-west.
              All the   telescopes are equipped with dual-channel (2.6 and 1.3mm)   cryogenic
              SiS receivers. At the shorter wavelength, the highest   angular resolution
              attainable by the array is 0.7 arcseconds.   Approximately 50% of the array's
              observing time is presently   devoted to investigations by non-Caltech
              astronomers.    During the tenure of the past three year grant, the Owens
              Valley   array has obtained aperture synthesis images of molecular emission  
              in domains ranging from comets to the envelopes of evolved stars,   to
              star-forming regions in the Galaxy, as well as the spiral arms   and active
              nuclei of other galaxies. The array has also been used   for extensive studies
              of active galactic nuclei, starburst and   ultraluminous galaxies at high
              redshifts.  During the last grant   period, the observatory also made a number
              of technical advances,   including the development of the ability to observe
              simultaneously   at 1 and 3mm, doubling the continuum bandwidth to 2 GHz, and  
              installing automated tuning and full LO coverage. An active system   to
              compensate for atmospheric phase fluctuations was also designed   and
              installation begun.  In the next three year grant period the   observatory's
              scientific programs will continue to include studies   of high redshift
              extragalactic systems, protostars and star-  forming regions and their
              associated protoplanetary nebulae, the   structure of the Milky Way Galaxy,
              collimated outflows from young   stars, interstellar chemistry and a variety of
              solar system   objects.
