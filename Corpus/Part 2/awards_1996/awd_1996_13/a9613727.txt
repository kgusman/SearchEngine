              Digital Wireless Networks:  Joint U.S - Mexico Research    This international
              cooperative project with ITESM enables researchers from the two universities to
              coordinate their research, use the ATM testbed, provide for faculty at the
              University of Texas at San Antonio to mentor some guest Mexican graduate
              students at UTSA, to assist with curriculum and instruction at ITESM, and to
              plan for a joint initiative for a broadband wireless network to serve the
              border region.
