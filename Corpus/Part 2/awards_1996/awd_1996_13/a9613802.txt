Abstract    :
              9613802    Hynes         In this project, quantum chemical electronic structure
              methods and molecular  dynamics computer simulations will be carried out to
              study the rates and mechanisms  of a number of reactions of chlorine and
              bromine species on the surface of  atmospherically relevant particles. These
              range from pure water ice to more complex  surfaces which include nitrate
              and/or sulfate ions. Heterogeneous reactions involving  chlorine and bromine
              have been strongly implicated in the catalytic destruction of  ozone in the
              Antarctic stratosphere and in the Arctic troposphee. Specific examples  include
              the one-step reaction of chlorine nitrate with hydrochloric acid and the two- 
              step version involving chlorine nitrate hydrolysis forming hypochlorous acid
              which  then reacts with hydrochloric acid to form molecular chlorine. The
              bromine analogs  of these reactions as well as the mixed bromine/chlorine cases
              will also be  considered.       This study will provide reaction mechanisms and
              reaction rates which are  needed as input for global chemistry and climate
              models. It is hypothesized that the  ice lattice plays an essential catalytic
              role in these reactions via proton transfers. It is  often difficult to
              determine experimentally whether a process occurs in one or several  steps, and
              whether reactions are ionic in character or not.
