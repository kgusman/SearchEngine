Abstract    :
              9626578  Canary       Professor Canary will explore a variety of conjectures
              concerning  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the deformation theory of Kleinian
              groups.  Several of these conjectures are motivated by Marden's tameness 
              conjecture, which predicts that every hyperbolic 3-manifold with  finitely
              generated fundamental group is topologically tame, i.e.,  homeomorphic to the
              interior of a compact 3-manifold.  Professor  Canary has previously established
              that topological tameness has strong  consequences for the geometry of a
              hyperbolic 3-manifold.  He will  also study the relationship between the
              algebraic limit and the  geometric limit of a sequence of Kleinian groups. 
              This study is  inspired by Thurston's ending lamination conjecture, which
              provides a  conjectural classification of all hyperbolic 3-manifolds.       A
              3-manifold is a mathematical space such that about any point there  is a
              neighborhood which can be identified with a ball in 3-dimensional  space.  One
              can imagine building 3-dimensional manifolds by gluing  together 3-dimensional
              blocks.  Of course, this gluing would have to  be an abstract gluing in
              general, not one which could be done in  3-dimensional space.  For example,
              consider the 3-manifold obtained by  taking the unit cube and gluing the top to
              the bottom, the front to  the back, and the left side to the right side.  A
              Riemannian metric is  a way of measuring distances and angles in a 3-manifold. 
              For  instance, the world we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian  metric. 
              In the 1970's, Wiliam Thurston conjectured that every  3-manifold can be cut
              up, in a canonical way, so that each piece has a  Riemannian metric of one of 8
              geometric types.  He proved his  conjecture for large classes of
              three-manifolds.  The 3-manifolds  which admit seven of the eight geometric
              types of Riemannian metrics  are completely classified and well-understood. 
              3-manifolds that  admit the eighth type of metric are called hyperbolic and are
              currently  a subject of intense interest and act ivity in the fields of
              geometry  and topology.  Professor Canary is investigating the relationship
              between  the topology and the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  ***
