Abstract    :
              Casey  9626553   No processes are more essential to low-temperature geochemistry
              than those leading to mass transfer among distinct solute species, and between
              minerals and adjacent aqueous fluids.  We propose to continue research that
              organizes dissolution reactions into a predictive framework.  The approach is
              to demonstrate quantitative similarity between the rate coefficients for metal
              removal from a surface and the better-characterized mechanisms of ligand
              exchange around dissolved complexes (Casey, 1991; Casey and Westrich, 1992;
              Ludwig et al., 1995a, b).  The quantitative similarity between these processes
              allows establishment of linear-free-energy relations (LFER) to predict rate
              coefficients.  In suitable cases we can identify possible rate-controlling
              elementary step reactions at mineral surfaces, such as the rates of water
              movement in the activated complexes, which we now know to be important (e.g.,
              Ludwig et al., 1995a).   New research will expand the predictive framework to
              examine the effect of organic ligands on rates of metal transfer.  We test the
              hypothesis that ligand-promoted rate coefficients (KL) for
              small-molecular-weight complexes are predictable using either the rates of
              solvent motion in the corresponding dissolved metal-ligand complex or the
              equilibrium constants that describe metal-ligand speciation in solution (see
              Ludwig et al., 1995a,b).  Key to success is acquisition of high-quality rate
              data on oxide minerals that differ considerably in metal-oxygen bond strengths.
               Also critical are:  (I) choice of ligands that form a single dominant surface
              complex stoichiometry in the dissolution reaction, (ii) in understanding the
              role of adsorbed protons in reaction, and (iii) in characterizing the
              degradation products.   This research addresses the common criticism of
              equilibrium models of contaminant geochemistry (e.g., Oreskes et al., 1994)
              that the important reactions are slow and the rate coefficients unknown. 
              Systematic study of a few ligands may serve to bound the re activities of a
              wide range of compounds because steric crowding must ultimately limit the size,
              rigidity, and number of ligands that can coordinate to a surface metal.
