Abstract    :
              9626173  Spatzier    The proposed research  lies at the interface of
              differential   geometry and dynamical systems.  A principal goal is to
              investigate   the dynamical and geometric structures of "higher rank" systems. 
               In particular, the investigator intends to classify hyperbolic   actions of
              higher rank abelian and semisimple Lie groups or actions  which preserve
              geometric structures, and also establish other   rigidity properties.  The
              investigator also plans to study   Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank
              ones) and their   geodesic flows.  Both geometric, dynamical and group
              theoretic   tools are used in this research.    Geometry is one of the oldest
              fields in mathematics, and generally   studies curves, surfaces and their
              higher dimensional analogues,   their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between
              such spaces.   Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now  
              studied for aesthetic reasons and its close ties with physics and   other
              sciences and applied areas (computer vision e.g.).  Dynamical   systems is a
              relatively new field that investigates the evolution   of a physical or
              mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in   a fluid flow).  New ideas
              and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos,   fractals) have changed our perception
              of the world fundamentally.   Dynamical systems have had a major impact on the
              sciences and   engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance has been
              instrumental   for developing efficient and safe codes for computer science.   
              Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell  biology
              and meteorology.
