Abstract    :
              9626404  Le          Thang Le is studying links in 3-manifolds as well  as
              quasicrystals.  The study of links concerns quantum and  finite type invariants
              of knots and links in 3-manifolds, including  generalizations of
              Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.  The study of quasicrystals involves
              local rules that determine  quasiperiodic tilings of Euclidean space.      
              Each of the topics in this project is intimately related to  physics.  The most
              powerful invariants of knots and links currently known  (i.e., most likely to
              distinguish among different but similar objects)    find their motivation in
              quantum field theory.  The algebraic aspect of  the theory is beautiful and
              rich in results.  However, the invariants   remain difficult to compute except
              in simple cases, and their intrinsic  topological meaning remains obscure.  The
              second topic, quasicrystals,  stems from the discovery in 1984 of solid
              substances whose spectrum has   sharp peaks enjoying some symmetries that real
              crystals do not (for  example, 5-fold symmetry).  It is believed that a
              mathematical model of    a quasicrystal is a quasiperiodic tiling of space,
              such as the famous   Penrose tilings of the plane discovered in 1973 by the
              physicist Roger   Penrose but considered at that time to be only a mathematical
              curiosity.  The project aims to shed light on each of these topics.  ***
