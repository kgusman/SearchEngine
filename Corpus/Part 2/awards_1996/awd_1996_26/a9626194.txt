Abstract    :
              9626194  Bryan  The project provides for partial matching travel support for
              overseas scientists participating as invited speakers or session leaders at the
              17th International Union of Crystallography Congress (IUCr), to be held at the
              Washington State Convention and Trade Center, Seattle, WA, from August 8-17,
              1996.      The triennial IUCr Congresses are the accepted international forum
              for the discussion and dissemination of new results and theoretical and
              experimental advances in crystallography.  Crystallography, through its primary
              tools, the diffraction of X-rays, neutrons and electrons by crystalline solids,
              is the principal method of obtaining accurate information on the
              three-dimensional structures of molecules and materials.  Such information is
              of fundamental importance in the development of many different branches of
              science, including chemistry, molecular biology, condensed matter physics,
              mineralogy and materials science.    The invited speakers and session leaders
              at the Congress are the acknowledged leaders in their specialties.  Because
              this will be the first IUCr Congress to be held in the United States since
              1969, it provides an unusually valuable opportunity for large numbers of US
              scientists to meet with and learn from these distinguished colleagues from
              overseas.    Funds provided by the Foundation will be combined with matching
              contributions from the IUCr itself, to provide needed support of travel costs.
