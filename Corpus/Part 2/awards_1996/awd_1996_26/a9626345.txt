              WORKHOP ON EVALUATION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS      This grant is to provide
              partial funding for a Workshop on  Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Systems, to be
              held December 7-8,  1995 at the National Library of Medicine, Bethesda,
              Maryland. The  purpose of this meeting is to clarify the questions and
              tradeoffs  involved in evaluating knowledge-based software designed to  assist
              decision-makers in contexts involving human health and  welfare.  These
              principles will have applications to all  knowledge-based  systems, but the
              acuteness of the need is most  apparent in deployments that directly involve
              human life.  Knowledge-based systems are complex pieces of software, so 
              empirical studies are necessary to predict their performance. The  workshop
              will bring together many persons who have undertaken  systematic evaluations of
              such systems to share their knowledge  and develop principled approaches to
              such evaluation.
