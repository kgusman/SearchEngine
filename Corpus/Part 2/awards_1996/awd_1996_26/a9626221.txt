Abstract    :
              9626221  Venema       This is a project in geometric topology.  Venema is
              currently   investigating problems involving existence of topological
              embeddings   in codimension two.  For example, he is working on the problem of 
               determining which elements of the second homology group of a  
              simply-connected 4-dimensional manifold can be represented by   topologically
              embedded (possibly wild) 2-spheres.  This is a   special case of the following,
              more general, problem: If a  compact n-dimensional manifold-with-boundary has
              the homotopy type of  some closed (n-2)-manifold, then is there a (wild)
              topological  embedding of the second manifold into the first which is a
              homotopy  equivalence?  What if the manifolds are highly connected?       This
              project concerns Venema's efforts to understand knotted spheres  in
              4-dimensional space.  Specifically, he is investigating the  question of what
              sorts of knots can be formed from different kinds of  spheres.  In the study of
              spheres in 4-dimensional spaces, three  different kinds of spheres have proved
              to be useful: those that are  smooth (possess continuously varying tangent
              vectors), those that are  piecewise linear (made up of a finite number of
              triangles), and those  that are topological (formed by continuous deformation).
               Spheres of  the first two types are fairly well understood, and there is a 
              reasonably well developed theory which predicts when a continuous  function
              from a sphere into a space can be deformed to a one-to-one  function whose
              image is a smooth or piecewise linear sphere.  This  research project aims to
              understand the mysteries of topological  spheres.  ***
