Abstract    :
              9626412 Arratia/Tavare  ABSTRACT  The investigators study the probabilistic
              properties of some of the most basic  structures in combinatorics and number
              theory, such as partitions of sets and integers, and the factorization of
              uniformly chosen integers into primes.  They apply techniques learned from the
              study of genetics and random permutations, including couplings, the total
              variation distance and Wasserstein metric for processes observing some or all
              of the possible component sizes, size-biased permutations of the components,
              sampling properties for populations, and Stein's method.   The interaction
              between pure and applied method can be fruitful for both.  Techniques motivated
              by the needs and intuitions from each field can illuminate the other.  For
              example, the applied study of genetics naturally involves sampling from
              populations, which leads to the notion of a size- biased permutation, which
              simplifies the understanding of a question from pure math, involving the large
              prime factors of a random integer. In the other direction, results proved about
              primes, such as bounds on the  "total variation distance", anticipated by three
              decades important work in statistics on the comparison of sampling with and
              without replacement.  The proposed investigation attempts to straddle the
              boundary between pure and applied math as it relates to genetics, sampling, and
              prime numbers.
