Abstract    :
              9633408  Haygood    Iron availability is believed to have an important influence
               on the productivity of marine environments.  The chemistry  of iron in the
              ocean is still poorly understood, but there  is an emerging consensus that iron
              is largely complexed by  organic compounds in seawater, thus affecting the
              chemical  behavior of iron, as well as its availability to organisms.  Many
              bacteria, including some marine species, are known to  produce siderophores,
              compounds which bind iron.  Such  siderophores may contribute to iron
              complexation in  seawater. The investigators will study siderophore  production
              by marine bacteria associated with particles.  This study seeks to determine
              whether siderophores  participate in iron complexation in seawater, and what 
              environmental conditions control their production.  Siderophore production by
              selected marine bacteria will be  studied in the laboratory using biochemical,
              molecular, and  immunological techniques.  Knowledge of the factors  regulating
              siderophore production will be useful in  predicting their occurrence in the
              marine environment and  will lead to a better understanding of iron and its 
              influence on productivity and community structure in the  ocean.  This
              information will be immediately useful in  chemical modeling of the behavior of
               iron in seawater.  These studies will provide a key link between studies of
              the  organic iron ligands in seawater, and the role of  bacteria  in
              influencing the availability of iron to phytoplankton and  bacteria in the
              ocean.
