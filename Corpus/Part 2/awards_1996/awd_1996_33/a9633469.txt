Abstract    :
              9633469  KU    Radioactive 26Al (half-life 0.7 My) and 10Be (1.5  My) on the
              earth  are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays  with atoms in the 
              atmosphere and in the surface of rocks. They  enter the ocean  chiefly via
              wet/dry fallout, with nearly constant  proportions  primarily reflecting their
              atmospheric production  ratios. Although  these cosmogenic radionuclides and
              their stable  isotopes (9Be and  27A1) differ in source functions, their
              pathways  in geochemical  reservoirs are linked through the isotopic kinship.  
              Together,  these isotopes can be used as powerful time and process  tracers in 
              geophysical studies.  Such tracer studies have become  feasible with  recent
              improvements made in the analytical  techniques, particularly  the ability to
              measure 26Al in marine  materials. Measurements will be made of authigenic
              10Be/9Be ratios  in sediments, concentrations of 10Be, 26Al, and U-unsupported
              230Th  in sediments, suspended particulate matter and sediment-trap  material,
              and 10Be and 7Be in sea water. These measurements will  improve our
              understanding  of the factors governing the oceanic  26Al-10Be fractionation
              and distribution, and facilitate our use of  the sedimentary signals of
              10Be/26Al to trace paleoproductivity,  and 26Al/230Th to trace past variations
              of cosmic-ray intensity. In  addition, 26Al, 10Be and 7Be will be used to
              evaluate particle flux  variations and particle dynamics in the water column.
