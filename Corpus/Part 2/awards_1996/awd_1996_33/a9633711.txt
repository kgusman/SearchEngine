Abstract    :
              9633711  WELSCHMEYER  Uncertainties in rates of oceanic primary production have
              been disputed for years. Although, the problem has been the subject of much
              review and experimentation, a discrepancy still exists between estimates of
              primary production based on non-manipulative biogeochemical calculations and
              those based on short-term 14C incubation experiments. We renew the theoretical,
              but untested, arguments that grazer-induced losses of metabolized carbon result
              in measurable underestimates of the true rate of primary production in standard
              14C experiments. A model is elaborated which predicts significant (two-fold)
              underestimates of production using realistic assumptions commensurate with
              modern views of marine food web structure. The model clearly identifies the
              importance of the timing of diel microzooplankton grazing as it affects the
              outcome of routine 12 h or 24 h incubations. Preliminary experiments, both in
              the lab and in the field, suggest the model is indeed realistic, and that
              underestimates of production are easily demonstrated, even in short 12 h
              daylight incubations. This project will undertake extensive laboratory
              experimentation designed to establish the stochiometry of metabolized 14C-loss
              against known rates of microzooplnakton grazing rates and respiration. The
              model will thus be empirically parameterized, allowing predictive estimates of
              14C-production errors to be made under in situ conditions of temperature,
              grazing and phytoplankton growth. A series of testable hypotheses is generated
              for field samples, and a complementary plan of field experiments is proposed,
              which will quantify grazer-induced production errors along a gradient of
              coastal-oligotrophic sites, including the JGOFS Hawaii time series station. An
              increasing gradient in production errors is expected as the natural community
              of grazers changes from coastal to oligotrophic plankton assemblages. This
              research project will result in a fully-tested analysis of grazer-induced
              errors in primary production experimen ts, including recommendations for
              optimized methodology , and will provide realistic constraints on error limits
              which may pertain to contemporary primary production data. A potentially
              significant portion of the oceanic productivity dilemma may be resolved as a
              result of this project.  ***
