Abstract    :
              9633498  Jacobsen    Title: Abundances of W and Mo in MORBs: characterization of
              the  depleted mantle reservoir.    The composition of the Earth's mantle is the
              consequence of core  formation, of mantle melting and liquid magma eruption,
              and of  subduction and recycling of crust back into the mantle. The low 
              abundance of some elements in the mantle is explained by their high  solubility
              in the core. Some elements prefer silicate minerals and  therefore are found in
              the mantle. Some elements do not prefer  metal or minerals and are therefore
              concentrated in liquid magmas.  The metals tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo)
              behave like metal-  lovers and like liquid-lovers so their concentration in the
              lavas  may tell much about the timing of the formation or the core. These 
              metals are in such low abundance, however, that few quality  analyses exist.
              This project will measure W and Mo in ocean floor  basalt to understand the
              segregation of the Earth's core, mantle,  and crust.
