Abstract    :
                  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), funded by the  Theory of
              Computing (TOC) Program, CCR, by the Theoretical Physics  Program, PHY and by
              the Informations Technologies Office, DARPA,  explores the application of the
              consistent history formulation of  quantum mechanics to some central problems
              in the new field of  quantum computation.  These applications include improving
               algorithms for quantum computation (1) by carrying out  measurements at
              itermediate times, and (2) by error detection and  correction.  Quantum
              computation has recently attracted a lot of  attention, because Peter Shor
              showed that certain tasks, including  factoring large numbers, could be carried
              out in polynomial time  on a quantum computer, whereas no polynomial-time
              algorithm for  factoring on a ``classical'' computer is presently known. 
              Clearly, if it could be built, such a computer would have many  important
              applications in many areas of computational science,  including in
              communications and information processing.  Actually  constructing such a
              quantum computer represents a daunting task,  because of severe technical
              difficulties.  One of the goals of  this SGER project is to initiate a
              collaborative effort between  computer scientists, theoretical physicists, and
              experimental  physicists at Carnegie Mellon University, in order to explore the
               applications of the consistent histories framework to determining  the
              feasibility of such a quantum computing device.  The  consistent histories
              approach make it possible to think about the  computational process in more
              realistic terms (where atoms,  photons, etc. are actually doing something over
              time) than is  possible in the usual ``textbook'' approach, that views the 
              quantum system as a ``great smokey dragon'' up until the point in  time at
              which a final measurement is made, and the wave function  of the system
              ``collapses'' into something which is physically  understandable.***
