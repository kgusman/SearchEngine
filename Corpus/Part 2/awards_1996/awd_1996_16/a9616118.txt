Abstract    :
              9616118  Thompson    This award provides two years of support for the phase down
              of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center at Iowa State University
              on Nondestructive Evaluation.  The center was started in 1985, and the National
              Science Foundation support for these centers must be phased down after that
              period support.  The objectives of the center are:  (1) to pursue industrially
              relevant research in nondestructive evaluation problems of interest to the
              industrial members, (2) to cooperate with academic units of the university in
              promoting numbers of students in both undergraduate and graduate programs, and
              (3) to establish a major national focal point for technology transfer in the
              area of nondestructive evaluation.  The research for the two year period
              includes development and evaluation of a library of ultrasonic scattering
              models for typical weld flaws; identification of model-based methods for
              extracting features inherent weld flaw signals for use in classification and
              characterization methods; demonstration of the capability of ultrasonic code
              for characterizing and classifying weld defects.    The center has 21
              supporting members (18 industrial + 3 government agencies and laboratories). 
              Through the efforts of the center, a minor in nondestructive evaluation is now
              offered in the engineering curriculum at Iowa State University.  The
              educational aspects of the center, and the impact of the center on education of
              graduate and undergraduate students is excellent.  The interaction with
              industry is outstanding, resulting in a high rate of transfer of important
              technology to industry and governmental agencies and laboratories.
