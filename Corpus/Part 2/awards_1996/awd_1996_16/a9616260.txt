Abstract    :
              9616260  Smith   In a three-institution collaboration with colleagues at Utah
              State University and Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, Dr. Alan Smith
              at University of California at Berkeley is amassing a major database of
              molecular and morphological characters of representatives of the 30 or so
              families of living ferns, in order to construct an overall phylogenetic
              framework for ferns. Building upon the impressive results of a 1994 symposium
              of fern specialists, with an international team that produced preliminary
              results for this effort (published in 1995), Smith and his colleagues are
              continuing a major DNA sequencing project for four genes, two from the
              chloroplast genome and two from the nucleus, that hold promise of yielding
              informative variation for genealogical analyses. This molecular database in
              turn is to be supplemented with traditional anatomical and morphological
              features drawn from the vegetative and reproductive parts of the same ferns
              analyzed for their DNA, features used standardly in their taxonomic
              identification and classification.   A well-resolved phylogeny for ferns will
              facilitate future work on the patterns and sequences of character evolution
              that gave rise to the Cretaceous radiation and diversification of the major
              group of ferns, the "polypodiaceous" group, and will provide a foundation for
              family- and genus-level taxonomic revisionary research. Using comparative
              methods, researchers can explore patterns of association among characters for
              correlated evolutionary changes, that may help explain the success or failure
              (extinction) of various lineages within the ferns.
