Abstract    :
              Ruess  9616537  Plants devote considerable energy to the production and
              maintenance of small-diameter  roots and their associated mycorrhizal fungi.
              How this below-ground allocation of carbon responds to altered availability of
              resources such as nitrogen is fundamental to our understanding of ecosystem
              function. There are currently two competing theories: (1) increased N
              availability decreases C allocation to roots; and (2) increased N availability
              increases C allocation to roots. Understanding fine root production and
              mortality is at the heart of this conflict. The overall hypothesis of the PIs
              is that the type of root-mycorrhizal association is a dominant factor
              controlling carbon allocation to roots, root longevity and the response to root
              systems to changes in N availability. The PIs propose to directly and
              independently quantify root production and mortality, mycorrhizal community
              composition and abundance, root respiration, soil CO2 flux, and above-ground
              litterfall at four long-term study sites that represent a range of ecosystems
              typical of North America. The study sites capitalize on contrasts between
              ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) conifers and hardwoods and
              represent a wide range of environmental conditions. Experimental additions of N
              are designed to address the issue of C allocation to roots at a scale that will
              resolve the controversy about how root growth and turnover at the ecosystem
              level responds to increasing N availability. By comparing and contrasting EM
              and AM dominated ecosystems under a variety of climatic and edaphic regimes, we
              will be able to make more universal statements about the factors controlling
              fine root turnover.
