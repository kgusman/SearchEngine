Abstract    :
              9616827  Grove    This grant provides $72,800 as partial support of the costs of
               upgrading the automation systems on each of two electron  microprobes
              maintained at MIT's Center for Geochemical Analysis.  While one of the EMP's
              was originally purchased in 1972 and has  since been upgraded with an
              additional wavelength dispersive  spectrometer (for a total of five), an
              additional used EMP was  purchased in 1992 (EAR-918402) to alleviate demand on
              the  original instrument.  Both instruments are fully subscribed by a  wide
              variety of regional researchers from MIT, WHOI, Boston  University, Wellesley
              College and Harvard University to name a  few.  The purpose of this upgrade is
              to replace the antiquated  and no longer supported Tracor Northern, DEC PDP-11
              based  automation systems which control both the stage and spectrometer  drives
              on these EMP's and also control the electronics of the  energy dispersive
              detectors (EDS) and additionally handle the  data reduction and image analysis
              programs.  These upgrades will  ensure continued functionality of these EMP's
              and provide for  state-of-the-art digital image analysis of backscattered
              electron  images thus aiding these scientists to tackle fundamental  problems
              in petrology and geochemistry such as studies of the  growth and evolution of
              continental crust and the lithosphere,  studies of magmatic processes within
              the crust, studies of the  mechanical properties of partially molten rocks
              under varying  condition of temperature, stress and lithostatic pressure, 
              petrologic investigations into the formation history of mantle  peridotites,
              the nature of hydrothermal alteration of oceanic  crust and studies of
              carbonate diagenesis.  ***
