                       ABSTRACT                                  NSF contract OPP 96-164000 
              Weber    This funding jacket will provide for the first award of the 
              helicopter services contract to Petroleum Helicopters, Inc.  (PHI), Lafayette,
              Louisiana, as a result of NSF solicitation  OPP 95-029, "Acquisition of
              Helicopter services for the  United States Antarctic Program and the New
              Zealand  Antarctic Program".  This two year contract (plus 3 one year  option
              periods) is being awarded by the NSF to PHI, with  Office of Aircraft Services
              (OAS) under the Department of  Interior (DOI) providing administrative
              oversight per  amended MOA of 25 Sept., 1995.  As administrator for the 
              Helicopter Services contract, OAS will provide periodic  disbursement of funds
              to PHI for services rendered, in  accordance with the amended MOA, via NSF/OAS
              contract OPP 96-  43291.  This jacket, in the amount of $1.00 U.S., will serve 
              to identify the Helo Services contract (i.e., give it a NSF  contract number)
              and track it in the NSF awards system, and  will be managed by the Deputy
              Research Support Section,  Office of Polar Programs.    This $1.00 funding
              action is necessary to allow for the  process of transferring $4,910,837.00
              from NSF to OAS, who  will make payments to PHI at billing intervals per the
              RFP  OPP 95029.  It's anticipated first payments to the  contractor will be
              required on/about 15 October, 1996.    The Program Manager has reviewed this
              request and recommends  it for funding.
