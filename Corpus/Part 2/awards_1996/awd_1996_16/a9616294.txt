Abstract    :
              9616294 Pender  Adaptive neural network control has many applications in the
              engineering arena, such as stabilization in hypersonic flight  Sachs '95 ,
              bioreactor stabilization  Ungar '90 , and avionic autolanders  Jorgensen '90 . 
              Complex engineering problems in control and system identification require
              considerable effort form the neural network engineer.  Multiple components are
              involved, including critic, action, and modeling units.  These reinforcement
              networks are capable of solving very difficult dynamic problems.  Another
              fascinating aspect of neuroengineering  is applying the concepts of
              neurocontrol and neuro-identification to model specific areas and activities of
              the brain.  In this work, neural network models based on the adaptive critic
              will be built up to incorporate the dynamics of avian birdsong learning.  The
              songs themselves are complex sequences of dynamic information, which must be
              represented internally in the brain as a "modeling" component.  The "action"
              component would be responsible for reproducing or creating a new birdsong,
              whereas the "critic" component guides the modeling and action components during
              the learning process.  Various parts  of the avian brain have been identified
              as taking part in the learning phase and production phase of avian singing. 
              Multiple factors may be incorporated into the model, as befits the knowledge of
              neurobiological researchers.  Lastly, the neural network models created may
              help direct neural biologists in their further "wetware" study of the brain. 
              It may provide a model of the general process of learning , which underlies
              behavior such as the human use of language.
