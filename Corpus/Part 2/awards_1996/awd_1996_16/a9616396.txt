              Digital Portfolio Archives in Learning:  Modeling Primary Content
              Transformation for Science Education    The University of California, Los
              Angeles has been awarded funding in the amount of $49,945 for a 12 month
              planning grant to develop a process model that (1) transforms primary sources
              into digital library content; (2) allows teachers to build personalized
              information systems or "Digital Portfolio Archives" (DPAs) that contain content
              and associated descriptions derived from the digital library, together with
              other relevant materials that teachers wish to incorporate; (3) enables
              students to incorporate components of teachers' DPAs, and (4) facilitates the
              optional incorporation of these DPAs back into the digital library, but as a
              distinct layer of user-created content distinguished to provenance.  Content
              for the base digital library will be drawn from the seven archival, manuscript,
              and museum repositories at UCLA.    The development and testing of the DPA
              process model builds on the work of, and feeds into several educational and
              technological initiatives underway at UCLA, including cross-disciplinary
              collaborations with the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles County Museum
              of Art, and Special Collections at the UCLA University Research Library.  This
              planning grant will generate: (1) generalizable processes for structuring
              digital libraries and enriching content descriptions that meet the needs of
              primary content creators, providers, and non-traditional users such as teachers
              and students; (2) knowledge of how teachers might select primary content and
              integrate it into classroom activities if it were digitally accessible; and (3)
              knowledge of how digitized primary sources might contribute to the enhancement
              of students' understanding of, and engagement in, the health and natural
              sciences.
