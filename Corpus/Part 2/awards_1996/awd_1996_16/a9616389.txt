Abstract    :
              9616389  Jacobson  There are two overall goals of this proposed planning
              project: (a) conduct preliminary research into cognitive and learning aspects
              associated with emerging areas of scientific inquiry dealing with complexity
              adaptive systems, and (b) develop a mock-up of a theory-and research-based
              technological  learning environment to help students learn the intellectual
              perspectives being identified in complex adaptive systems research and how
              these can be applied across a wide range of natural phenomena.  Research into
              systems, the operation of the immune system, economic-has identified how many
              disparate phenomena can be characterized by the interactions of numerous
              individual elements that self-organize at a higher systems level, and in turn
              show emergent and adaptive properties not exhibited by the individual elements.
              There are also ways that a complex adaptive system takes in data from its
              environments, finds regularities in the data, and compresses these perceived
              regularities into schemes that are used to describe and predict its future.
              Unlike complex nonadaptive systems such as stars or galaxies, a complex
              adaptive system exhibits evolutionary processes in that these schemes are
              subjected to selection pressures in the context of specific environmental
              conditions that tend to change the schemes over time. Further, complex adaptive
              systems seem to function best under conditions that may be described as
              intermediate between chaos and order-sometime referred to as the edge of chaos.
               A central hypothesis of this project is that in order  for learners to
              understand relevant scientific phenomena from the perspective of complex
              adaptive systems, they will need to acquire new ways of  thinking, ways that
              focus on the self-organizing, emergent, and adaptive features of the complex
              whole rather than the reductive decomposition of complexity into simple,
              isolated parts. A second and related hypothesis of this project is that these
              new ways of thinking may be counter-intuitive or conflict wi th commonly held
              beliefs, and thus require students to undergo a process of conceptual change
              before they can understand important conceptual perspectives associated with
              complex adaptive systems. Obtaining base-line data concerning these hypotheses
              will be important in order to inform the development of technological and
              nontechnology learning materials and activities for students as they learn
              about complexity and complex adaptive systems.  There are four components of
              the project: (a) review of the scientific, psychological, and learning science
              literatures on the content related to complex adaptive systems and the
              cognitive factors relevant to learning about difficult, counter-intuitive
              scientific knowledge, (b) consult with content experts in areas involving
              complex adaptive systems, and with cognitive psychologists and science
              educators with expertise in scientific knowledge representation,
              misconceptions, and conceptual change, (c) conduct exploratory studies of
              students and teachers working on problems involving complex adaptive systems
              and using existing complex adaptive systems simulation software, and (d)
              develop a mock-up of an integrated case-based hypermedia, visualization, and
              computer modeling learning environment dealing with complex adaptive systems
              phenomena such as the flocking behavior of birds and selected cases of
              biological evolution. It is heed that the results of this research will provide
              insights into the nature of the understandings experts and novice college and
              high school students have about various complex adaptive systems phenomena. In
              addition, this project should prepare for future work into the development of 
              technological learning environments that can help students deeply learn
              centrally important ideas in this emerging area of scientific inquiry with
              relevance to a wide range of natural phenomena.
