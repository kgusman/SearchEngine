Abstract    :
              9616372  Bieler  The collections of Recent pulmonate gastropods (land snails) at
              the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) contain about 3.5 million specimens
              in about 208,000 dry shell and alcoholic lots. FMNH's land snail collection is
              one of the most comprehensive in the world, especially for the eastern U.S.
              species.  These collections comprise a unique resource for ecological,
              environmental, systematic and other studies. The holdings, including many
              primary types, and "orphaned" historic collections from other institutions,
              have never been inventoried, and much of the information has remained
              inaccessible.  NSF funding will provide computer cataloging staff, and
              equipment and supplies for re-housing and expanding the pulmonate snail
              collection. Results of the project will include: counting of specimens, updates
              of certain label information, re-housing of problem lots, production and
              distribution of new labels, archival storage of specimens and labels,
              separation of previously 'hidden' type material, updated and expanded
              collection arrangement, further development of authority fields, and
              presentation of the data, data model and authority files on FMNH's World Wide
              Web site.  The project is funded by a partnership among the NSF, the USGS
              Biological Resources Division, and the Field Museum, which is matching the
              award with staff time,  hardware and software for the database system, and
              additional supplies.
