Abstract    :
              Rogers  9616243    Funding is requested for partial support from the National
              Science Foundation for a national working symposium on the best processes for
              assessment in  engineering education.  The two-day symposium will focus on both
              the processes and tools which can be used in developing and implementing an
              assessment plan, appropriate use of assessment methods, and the feedback of
              results.  The target audience for this workshop is engineering deans,
              department heads, and engineering faculty.  The context for discussions will be
              the ABET Criteria 2000.  Each presenter will be asked to frame and develop
              materials for their presentations within this context as Criteria 2000 provides
              a common denominator for all engineering programs.    The Organizing Committee
              will identify persons who have had experience in the focus areas of the
              conference and encourage them to submit abstracts and outlines of proposed
              sessions.  In addition, the engineering education community will be invited to
              submit abstracts.  The overarching criteria for selection will be the
              practicality and relevance of the proposed topic to engineering education.    A
              final report will be submitted to NSF, ABET, and ASEE describing the model and
              the lessons learned from the symposium planning process and an analysis of the
              symposium assessment results.  A WWW page will be established to encourage
              networking among attendees.  The symposium abstracts will be distributed to all
              participants and made available on the symposium Web site.    The Symposium is
              scheduled to be held April 11-12, 1997 on the campus of Rose-Hulman Institute
              of Technology.  Rose-Hulman is a recognized leader in undergraduate engineering
              education and has developed innovative curriculum and outstanding educational
              facilities.  Participants will be provided on opportunity to experience some of
              the new state-of-the-art flexible learning spaces and talk with faculty and
              students about curriculum development and projects.
