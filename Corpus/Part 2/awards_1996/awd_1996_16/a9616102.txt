Abstract    :
               This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Colorado.  The student will study the relationship between
              Japanese corporate wives' self-identity and their experience of home-making in
              the alien environment, for them, of the United States.  As wives and mothers,
              Japanese women are responsible for the cultural reproduction of the home, and
              the project will investigate how they cope with the challenges of reproducing a
              Japanese home in a foreign place.  The student has studied Japanese wives in a
              small, dispersed expatriate community in Denver.   This project will extend her
              ethnographic, participant-observation research into two other expatriate
              communities: in a medium-size `company town` environment in Ohio, and in a
              large, diverse expatriate community in the NYC metropolitan area.  In each area
              she will develop an informant pool of 15-20 key housewife informants and will
              interview Japanese corporate officials, government officials, and other
              professionals who come into contact with Japanese residents. Variables to be
              studied include corporate organization and policies, the employment situation,
              subjects' life history, and social networks.   This research is important
              because it will add to our knowledge of how the transnational, globalization of
              families affects their core function of reproducing home culture while adapting
              positively to an alien location.  Japan, as a world power, has long had
              expatriate families in other regions of the world, who have remained
              distinctively `Japanese`.  This research will advance our understanding of the
              fundamental processes of this sort of cultural creation and maintenance in this
              important case.
