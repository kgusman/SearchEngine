Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              Stanford University, studying the relationship of racial and ethnic
              stratification in people (both local and foreign) involved in the tourist
              industry in Ethiopia.  The tourists come from a social system where race often
              signifies lower social status, while the Ethiopian social system uses ethnic
              group identity and not race is the marker of status.  Through intensive
              interviews and participant observation of tourists and natives in four distinct
              regions of the country, the student will investigate how notions of nationhood,
              statehood, and race influence both Ethiopian and foreign English-speaking
              tourists' perceptions of themselves and of each other.  This study of Ethiopian
              racial discrimination is valuable because it is not based on an ideology of
              white supremacy, but instead on the dominance of one regional ethnic group
              above others.  Methods include historical, ethnographic, and mass-media
              research on how different definitions of history are used to support claims of
              regional difference. It will also advance our understanding of the impact of
              tourism, as well as the impact of development programs, on local systems of
              social stratification.  In addition this research will contribute to our
              nation's expertise about this important area of the world.
