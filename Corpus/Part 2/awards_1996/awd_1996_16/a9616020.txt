Abstract    :
               This award supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist from
              Southern Methodist University.  The project is to study two Mayan Indian
              peasant communities in Yucatan, Mexico to assess the impact of men's
              out-migration for periods of wage labor on women's status in the communities. 
              Using ethnographic methods of participant observation and intensive interviews
              as well as a random census of households in two villages, one with extensive
              male laborer out-migration  and the other with insignificant migration, the
              student will assess the status of women and of households.   This research is
              important because the migratory movement of rural people in response to wage
              labor opportunities is a major phenomenon in the developing world.  this
              project will advance our understanding of the effects of such migration on the
              households left behind, and how the temporary increase in women's daily
              responsibilities to administer their households in their husbands' absence
              translates (or does not translate) into relatively significant changes in their
              social and economic status.  Women's' status has been shown to be a major
              factor affecting the welfare of children, so increases in our understanding of
              the causes of women's status has direct implications for households and
              families.
