Abstract    :
              9616855    The traditional advection-dispersion theory for miscible  contaminant
               (solute) migration through soil in reality represents a  limiting case of  the
              more general coupled-flow theory in which the coupling  terms (e.g.  water flow
              due to chemico-osmosis) are assumed to be zero.  While this  assumption is
              generally acceptable in the case of miscible  contaminant  migration through
              relatively high permeability materials,  the accuracy of  this assumption in
              terms of the relatively low-permeability,  fine-grained  materials typical of
              pollutant barriers has not been  formally evaluated.    The goal of this study
              is to evaluate the significance of  chemico-osmosis  and electro-osmosis on the
              migration of miscible  contaminants through  engineered clay barriers used for
              waste containment and in  situ  remediation.  The following objectives will be
              addressed:    * coupled flow parameters (e.g. hydraulic, chemico-  osmotic, and
               electro-osmotic conductivity; electrical conductance; and  osmotic  efficiency
              coefficient) for clay soils will be measured  under several  different test
              conditions (stress, compaction, solute  concentration and  type);    *
              parameters expected to dominate solute transport under  low-flow  conditions
              will be measured independently for the same  soils, solutes, and  test
              conditions;    * measured migration rates of the solutes through  laboratory
              soil columns  will be compared with predicted rates using analytical  models
              based on both  the coupled flow and the advective-diffusive modeling 
              approaches; and    * a finite difference model will be developed and used to 
              evaluate the  potential effect of volume change on solute mass flux for  both
              coupled flow  and the advective-diffusive modeling approaches.  ***
