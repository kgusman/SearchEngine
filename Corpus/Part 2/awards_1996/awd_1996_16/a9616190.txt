Abstract    :
              9616190  Dykhuizen   Two competing species, each a winner on a single
              substitutable resource, may coexist when both resources are available.  Will
              there be a sympatric divergence of the two species, each  specializing on its
              preferred resource, or will one evolve to replace the other?  Because mutation
              is a stochastic process, many believe that the adaptive divergence of
              populations  is irreproducible: if the tape of life is rerun, the evolutionary
              outcome will be dramatically different.  Drs. Dean and Dykhuizen propose to
              distinguish these hypotheses experimentally using replicated populations of
              clonal bacteria.  Because the strains are almost genetically identical, the
              ecological question of sympatric speciation becomes congruent with the genetic
              question of the evolution of specialization through trade-offs.   Part 1 will
              establish two strains of E. coli harboring two different lactose operons and
              competing for two alternative galactosides.  This study will test the
              prediction, made from a knowledge of biochemistry (a bottom up approach), that
              the two strains will coexist only within a certain range of ratios of the two
              alternative galactosides.   Part 2 investigates the evolutionary dynamics of
              coexistence.  Long-term chemostat  experiments (a top-down approach) will allow
              adaptive mutations to accumulate in each strain.  These experiments are
              designed to address: 1) whether trade-offs at the molecular level force
              specialization on particular resources;  and, 2) whether increasing
              specialization (or increasing generalization) perturbs the initial equilibrium
              frequencies or leads to competitive exclusion (i.e. only one strain wins).
