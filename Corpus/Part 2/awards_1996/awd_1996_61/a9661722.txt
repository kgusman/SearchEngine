Abstract    :
                ***  9661722  Giancola     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I is
              directed at developers working with high performance parallel computers. The
              primary commercial application codes for these computers are thus tools for
              software development. To date, these tools have not been designed with an eye
              to the requirements of the high performance computing user, but rather have
              been ported from workstations, where their targets are much more limited in
              scale. The most important of these tools, and to date the most inadequate, are
              the symbolic debuggers. Experience in the supercomputer development environment
              on both CTSS and UNICOS has shown that the most essential feature for an
              effective debugger to have in addition to the standard ones of process control
              and variable evaluation is the ability to save the target's state for later
              restoration. Macro processing is another required capability; it allows the
              user to record complex sequences of debugging commands for easy reuse. Also
              essential is acceptance of an incomplete set of symbol table information to
              enable the maximum possible function on optimized code. This project will
              develop software technology for debuggers which it is believed no such debugger
              for high performance parallel computing environment exists.    This technology
              will be marketed to one or more parallel computer hardware vendors for
              incorporation into proprietary debuggers for bundled and unbundled sale with
              systems and to retain the rights to market a workstation version.  ***
