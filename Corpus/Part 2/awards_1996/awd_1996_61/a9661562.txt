Abstract    :
              ***  96-61562  Patterson     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will demonstrate the fabrication of dense, strong and tough ceramic
              laminated matrix composites (CLMCs)  through the in-situ alignment, seeding and
              growth of acicular b DGG1 -Si3N4 particles in Si3N4 reinforcing fibers. These
              green-state fibers will be incorporated into a a-Si3N4 green-state laminate
              matrix fabricated by a tape casting and stacking procedure. The key advantage
              of this processing technology is the ability to do pressureless sintering of 
              the CLMC material to full density thereby significantly reducing the cost and
              enabling net-shape components to be fabricated. Since the toughening fibers are
              not yet dense when incorporated into the matrix laminates, the composite
              structure can be fully densified via pressureless sintering because the fiber
              and matrix phases will undergo simultaneous densification. This unique
              materials system, although pressureless sintered, will exhibit many of the
              characteristics of fiber-reinforced composites sintered via pressure-assisted
              densification - namely, high density, strength, and toughness achieved through
              crack bridging and fiber pullout.   The Phase I research will demonstrate
              (-Si3N4 fiber-toughened laminates, thereby establishing a method of fabricating
              net-shape components (via pressureless sintering) which will exhibit high
              density and high toughness through mechanisms such as fiber pullout. 
              Fiber-reinforced laminates will be used to fabricate components for turbine
              engine applications such as combustors, exhaust nozzles, shrouds, flaps and
              seals.  It is anticipated that the successful development of the (-Si3N4 
              fiber-toughened composite material will provide significant cost savings for
              the fabrication of ceramic composites.    ***    Page: 1   DGG1
