Abstract    :
                ***  96-61683  Weeks     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing a composite electrical
              lead material which has a controlled expansion section for bonding to the
              electronic device, and a ductile region which can be bent and formed. The lead
              should have electrical conductivity 70 to 80% of copper and thermal
              conductivity equivalent to copper. Bonding to ceramic materials will be
              demonstrated in Phase I. As electronic device structures and materials continue
              to be improved, increasingly greater amounts of electrical power can be
              switched and controlled by smaller devices. There is an increasing need for
              lead materials which can be directly bonded to the electronic devices and other
              ceramic materials. While copper/graphite composite materials can be produced
              which match the coefficient of expansion of silicon and other ceramics, these
              composites cannot be formed or bent during packaging of the electronic device. 
                            These leads will be useful in motor controls to electric cars,
              and high power, high frequency   semiconductors. Power electronic devices
              continue to increase in importance as electric controls   replace hydraulics.
