Abstract    :
              ***  9661015  Kane     The This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will investigate a novel Tbit/sec, all-optical crossbar interconnect. 
              The full potential of all-fiber networks is not fully exploited owing to the
              lack of high-bit-rate switches and interconnects; state-of-the-art electronic
              crossbars cannot accommodate bit rates higher that several hundred Mbit/sec.
              Commerciallyavailable all-optical interconnects (capable of handling high bit
              rates) exhibit slow reconfiguration speeds, are not easily scaled to route
              large numbers of input signals, and are often fragile and sensitive to
              environmental disturbances.   Reveo has invented a unique polarization-based
              all-optical interconnect which overcomes the limitations of existing
              technology, and features Tbit/sec capacity, fast (microsecond to nanosecond)
              reconfiguration speed, ultra-broad spectral bandwidth, low insertion loss, low
              crosstalk, robust all-solid-state construction, low power consumption, and
              simple scaleability. This crossbar interconnect utilizes powerful network
              architectures, including Benes, shuffle-exchange, omega, PM2I, and Reveo's PM2K
              design. Our unique hardware arrangement will allow for the development and
              commercialization of crossbar switches which can be operated in any wavelength
              regime.   Phase I research will focus on proof of concept, and characterization
              of a small crossbar device. In Phase II we will develop materials for the
              interconnect optics, and will develop larger (8X8) switches. Phase III will
              focus on commercialization and manufacturing of this novel technology.      The
              proposed technology will have immediate applications in telecommunications,
              networking, and back-plane interconnections, as this crossbar interconnect will
              be compatible with the existing telecommunications infrastructure. It has been
              estimated that the market for optical interconnects will continue to grow at an
              annual rate of 29% per year through 1998, and 23% per year from 1998-2003
              (Laser Focus World, 1994).  ***
