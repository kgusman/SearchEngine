Abstract    :
              DMS-9508709  Glasserman   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs
              in the Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
              stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
              industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
              mathematical sciences. The University-Industry Postdoctoral Research
              Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of doctoral
              degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing
              to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral
              fellow will work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and
              industry.   Emerging standards for high-speed telecommunications networks of
              the near future pose new challenges for mathematical modeling and computation,
              and offer an exceptional opportunity for advanced mathematical ideas to help
              shape a major new  technology.   The high speed of the new technology and the
              stringent performance constraints of new services require for their analysis
              the development and application of asymptotic methods for stochastic processes.
              This project addresses that need through the  development of new asymptotics
              and bounds for performance, and the development of efficient, robust Monte
              Carlo methods for numerical evaluation of network designs and controls.
