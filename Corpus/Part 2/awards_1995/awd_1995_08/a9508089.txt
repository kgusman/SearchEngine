Abstract    :
              9508089  Elliot    Abstract          This award supports a geologic research
              project that will take advantage of an  opportunity to participate in the
              1994-95 geology field program of the Argentine  Antarctic Institute. 
              Participation will provide the opportunity to address important  problems in
              the stratigraphic relations and dating of the Paleogene strata on Seymour 
              Island and to field check the new 1:20,000 topographic map that is being
              prepared by the  USGS.          The sedimentary strata on Seymour Island are
              part of the only exposed Upper  Cretaceous to Lower Tertiary marine sequence in
              Antarctica.  The Cretaceous-Tertiary  succession was deposited in an ensialic
              back-arc basin related to the development of the  mid-Mesozoic to mid-Cenozoic
              active plate margin of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Seymour  Island strata range
              in age between Late Campanian and middle(?) Eocene to earliest(?)  Oligocene. 
              These poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks contain a diverse and 
              exceptionally preserved invertebrate fauna, a diverse microflora, and a variety
              of  vertebrates, including marsupials.  Fieldwork (to be supported by the
              Argentine Antarctic  Institute in the 1994-95 season) will be directed toward:
              resolving the complex  stratigraphic relations of the Paleogene units on
              Seymour Island; collection of tuff beds  for radiometric dating, and petrologic
              and geochemical analysis; and sequence analysis of  the Paleogene succession.  
                   This award is to support travel to Buenos Aires to join the Argentine
              Antarctic  Institute's geology project, travel to confer with the USGS about
              the results of field  checking of the topographic map, and laboratory studies
              on samples collected in the  course of the field season.  Specifically, the lab
              objectives are to:  1) date the ash beds in  order to provide absolute age
              control for sequences that lack calcareous and siliceous  microfossil
              assemblages; and 2) establish the geochemistry of the ash beds to assess 
              contemporaneous volcanic activity and magmatic evol ution of the source region.
                     The results will provide the stratigraphic framework for on-going
              paleontological  projects on Paleogene strata, radiometric data in support of
              paleontological ages and  sequence analysis, and characteristics of the
              magmatic activity in the source region of the  sediments.
