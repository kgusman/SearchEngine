Abstract    :
                 9508637 Ganz  A recently developed high speed scanning tunneling microscope
              (STM) will be used to study chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth and
              diffusion processes on silicon surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).  The
              surfaces will be imaged with atomic resolution in situ before, during, and
              after growth at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 800 K.  This
              instrument operates roughly 30 times faster than conventional instruments, at
              scan rates up to 100,000  /s which allows the study of CVD processes with
              atomic resolution on time scales down to 10 ms.  The project will address three
              general aspects of Al CVD on silicon: the growth of Al using the precursor,
              dimethylethylamine alane (DMEAA); surface mass diffusion of the deposited
              material; and selective area growth of Al on clean and patterned silicon
              surfaces.  The selectivity of growth will be tested on clean surfaces with
              small metal islands, and also using features drawn into a monohydride resist
              layer.  The ability to remove hydrogen, atom by atom, from hydrogenated silicon
              surfaces using the STM tip coupled with selective growth of Al on unexposed
              areas allows basic studies of nanoscale fabrication, in addition to the
              investigation of fundamental nucleation and growth phenomena associated with
              CVD.  %%% A high speed scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has recently been
              developed and will be used for basic research studies of  the growth and
              diffusion of aluminum on silicon, a process important to the fabrication of
              advanced microelectronic devices and circuits. The ultrafast STM technology
              will be studied further as part of the research, and tested for possible use in
              the definition and delineation of ultrafine device and circuit patterns. This
              technology is also being considered for applications in the fabrication of high
              density memory media. Additionally, an important feature of the program is the
              training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area.  The knowledge and und erstanding gained from
              this research project is expected to contribute generally to improving the
              performance of existing, and the creation of new, more advanced devices used in
              computing, information storage and processing, and telecommunications. ***
