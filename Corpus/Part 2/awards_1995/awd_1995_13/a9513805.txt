Abstract    :
              9513805  Spicer  This project is to develop a high resolution model describing
              how regA protein recognizes and binds to specific mRNAs.  Thus, our goals are
              to identify specific sites of interaction between regA protein residues and the
              known gene 44 recognition element through site specific mutagenesis, and
              photocrosslinking, and to collaborate with others in attempting to generate
              co-crystals of regA protein and a target RNA.  To identify residues of regA
              protein that form critical bonds with target RNAs, structure-guided mutagenesis
              of regA protein will be coupled with in vitro screening techniques to identify
              informative, functionally deficient mutants.  Proteins identified with
              functional alterations will then be examined for changes in RNA affinity and
              RNA recognition specificity using fluorescence quenching binding assays and
              "missing contact" assays.  Photocrosslinking of regA protein to 5-iodouracil
              substituted RNA will be carried out to probe the sites of RNA contact on regA
              protein.  We will make a series of mutations on the surface of regA protein,
              particularly at the dimer interface and test the mutant proteins for the
              retention of RNA binding activity.  Clones over-expressing mutant regA proteins
              that retain WT RNA binding will be provided for crystallography trials.  ***
