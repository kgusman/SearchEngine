Abstract    :
              9513898  Lowey  The goal of the research is to test the "rotating crossbridge
              model" for muscle contraction by two approaches:  (1) cryo-electron microscopy
              and image analysis will be used to analyze the molecular structure of actin
              filaments decorated with recombinant myosin head fragments.  By combining the
              X-ray crystal structures of actin and S1 with the computer generated
              three-dimensional reconstructions from electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated
              decorated F-actin, it may be possible to see whether conformational changes
              occur in myosin upon its binding to actin.  (2) Multi-dimensional nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) will be used to explore the structure of the
              regulatory light chain in the free and bound state, and its interactions upon
              phosphorylation.  The light chain and its target peptide will be expressed in
              E. coli for isotope labeling.  The structure of the skeletal muscle light chain
              will be compared to the smooth muscle light chain for a better understanding of
              the mechanism of regulation in these two major muscle types.  %%%  The most
              widely accepted theory of how muscles contract involves a reorientation of the
              myosin head relative to the actin filament as the filaments slide past one
              another.  A fundamental problem with the "rotating crossbridge model" has been
              the failure to detect any large conformational changes within the myosin
              molecule that could account for the large distance over which an attached
              crossbridge can develop tension.  The studies proposed here are designed to
              test models for muscle contraction based on the recently solved crystal
              structure of the myosin head.  ***
