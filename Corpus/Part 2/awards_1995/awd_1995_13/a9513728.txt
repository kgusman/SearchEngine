              coli and Mu genetics will be used to dissect the araB-lacZ fusion system, the
              first rigorously documented example of physiologically-regulated mutation in
              bacteria ("adaptive mutation").  In this system, a Mu prophage forms a hybrid
              protein coding sequence by joining portions of the araB and lacA cistrons. 
              Fusion studies using a non-lethal Mu B-KAN(7701 prophage have uncovered
              evidence for an activated state preceeding actual fusion formation and
              suggested that fusion kinetics are determined at two different levels:  (1) Mu
              activation/derepression and (2) differential processing of the strand-transfer
              complex intermediate in Mu-promoted DNA rearrangements.  This project will
              capitalize on molecular genetic technology and our ability to manipulate both
              the bacterial and Mu prophage genomes to accomplish two specific aims:  (1)
              identify the nature of pre-fusion intermediates formed by thermal derepression
              of B-KAN(7701 strains, and (2) identify molecules in the signal transduction
              system controlling fusion formation.  These studies will extend our
              understanding of how bacteria and other living cells are able to modify the
              structures of their genomes.  In particular, it will illuminate how differences
              in cellular growth conditions activate and influence the natural genetic
              engineering systems which all organisms possess.  This research will shed new
              light on evolutionary processes and our ability to modify cells for use in
              biotechnology.  ***
