Abstract    :
                      The  ultimate  objective  of this project is to  develop  and  to  make 
              available   to   the   neuroscience  research  community   siliconbased 
              microelectrode  arrays ("probes") for recording  signals  from  nervous 
              tissue,  as  well  as  critical  supporting  equipment  for  performing 
              practical   multisite   neuronal  recording   experiments.   The   tiny 
              fork-shaped  silicon  probes have several microelectrodes  on  each  of  their 
              multiple shafts, and allow simultaneous recording from  multiple  neurons  at 
              various depths and lateral spacings. Each shaft  typically  occupies  less
              volume than a pair of microwire electrodes. Using  these  probes,  it  will  be
              possible to obtain a detailed  look  at  a  local  network of neurons.   
              Initial  development  of the basic technologies has  been  accomplished  with 
              the  support  of  a  previous grant from NSF.  Probes  have  been  manufactured
               using a new microfabrication process, and neural  signals  have  been 
              recorded  with  them  from  the  cerebellar  cortex  of  an  anesthetized  rat.
               The present grant will support efforts  to  further  develop   the 
              instrumentation  and  to  test  it  in  three  different  neurophysiology 
              laboratories. The goal of this funding  period  is  to  develop  the 
              technology to the point that it  can  be  distributed  to  outside users at the
              end of the grant, through a collaboration  with  a  commercial  ncuroscience 
              equipment vendor.  With  this  approach,  the  project  should have a broad and
              rapid impact by making  silicon  probe  experiments accessible to the
              neuroscience community at large.
