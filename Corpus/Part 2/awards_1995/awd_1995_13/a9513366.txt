Abstract    :
              9513366  Deng   Signals from the environment are perceived by specific
              regulatory receptors in plants, and transduced and integrated with
              developmental signals to control growth and development. The long term goal of
              this research is to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which such signals are
              transduced and integrated to modulate plant development by using
              light-regulated seedling development of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system.
              Ten pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS loci have been identified, which when mutated fail
              to suppress the photomorphogenic development in darkness and result in
              dark-grown seedlings phenocopying the light-grown siblings. One of the ten
              loci, COP9 locus, has been cloned and found to encode a novel, ubiquitously
              expressed 23 kDa protein. It was demonstrated that COP9 acts as a subunit in a
              large (560kDa) multiple subunit complex, which is nuclear localized and whose
              conformation is probably modulated by light. The results suggest that the COP9
              complex defines a step in the nexus of the network mediating light control of
              seedling development. To further characterize the structure of the complex and
              its functional role in the network mediating light control of plant
              development, the next stage of investigation will focus on accomplishing two
              major goals: 1) cloning of the genes and biochemical characterization of the
              subunits of the complex and 2) understanding the biochemical and cellular basis
              of the function of the COP9 complex function and its molecular interaction with
              other components in the light regulatory network.  %%%  Accomplishment of the
              proposed investigation will ascertain the nature of a critical regulatory
              complex that links light and possibly other signals to seedling development and
              could provide novel insights into the  relationships between regulatory
              components of the network of elements affecting light control of plant
              development.  ***
