              Buss        Invertebrate allorecognition responses have been known since the
              turn of the century and have been claimed to represent primitive vestiges of
              the vertebrate immune system.   Several attempts have been made to establish
              the molecular basis of these responses, without notable success.  This is due
              in part to lack of an adequate  laboratory model system, particularly the lack
              of defined genetic lines bred for their fusibility characteristics.  This
              project will continue efforts to develop isogenic and congenic lines of the
              hydrozoan Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus.  These organisms would then be used in
              studies of allorecognition which will provide information not only on these
              organisms but  on the origin of the immune response. ***
