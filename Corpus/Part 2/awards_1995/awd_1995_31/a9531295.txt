Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will explore an
              innovative solution to the generic problem of transfer of information, logical
              data and analog signals, between rotating and stationary members in a
              mechanical system.  The particular problem to be addressed is precision
              measurement of torque in a rotating shaft.  Precision torque transducers
              currently available are typically based on technology over 20 years old, are
              costly to make, and require specialized equipment to recover the torque signal.
               They have a practical upper limit to shaft speed of about 25,000 RPM.  For
              speeds above 10,000 RPM, the price increases rapidly with the speed
              differential.  The objective of this research is to develop a new technology
              for contact-less transfer of information between rotating and stationary
              members in a mechanical system with the goal of making precision contact-less
              torque transducers at low cost which are suitable for speeds up to 100,000 RPM.
               The research approach is to process the analog torque signal on the rotating
              shaft where it is generated, and to optically communicate the result to the
              stationary subsystem.  A specific goal of Phase II research is to build a truly
              non-contact (no bearings) manufacturing prototype torque transducer rated at
              100 to 1000 NM.  It will be tested for speeds for speeds up to 50,000 RPM.  The
              power needed for processing the torque signal will be supplied by a rotary
              power transformer, integral to the transducer.  The digitized torque signal
              communicated by optical coupling to the stationary subsystem will be processed
              by a microprocessor, integral to the transducer, for decimal display and
              optional RS232 interface.  Unlike the non-contact (with bearing ) transducers
              available in the market, it will not require any dedicated instruments to
              recover the torque signal.  While the opportunity in this project is presented
              in terms of rotary shaft torque transducer application, the developed
              technology will be useful for measurement of other physical variables such as
              force, temperature, pressure, etc., in mechanical systems with moving parts. 
              If successful, the research will lead to a new technology for transfer of
              information between rotating and stationary members of a mechanical system.  It
              will find application in equipment used for product development in aircraft,
              automobiles, heavy machinery, and durable goods industries.  It is suitable for
              on-board applications in ships and aircraft.  It has potential for on-board
              application in automobiles, particularly in steering control of electric cars.
