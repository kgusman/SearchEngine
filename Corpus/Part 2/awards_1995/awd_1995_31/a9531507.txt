Abstract    :
              9531507  Mathias       This REU site award will provide a new type of 
              educational opportunity for undergraduates that combines  research experiences
              over two summers, first at an academic  site and then at an industrial one. 
              Rising juniors will  first attend USM to receive broad training (first week 
              short-courses) in polymer science, instrumental analysis,  and safety followed
              by a research project carried out in  collaboration with industrial partners. 
              Two separate  weekly meetings of students and faculty will involve: 5  minute
              student summaries of their projects combined with an  industrial presentation
              on selected topics; and an  introduction to molecular modeling combined with 
              discussions on professional ethics.  Final talks will be  given to combined
              USM-industrial participants.  Rising  seniors will spend their summer
              continuing the projects at  industrial sites (like a co-op or internship) but
              with  project groundwork already established.  Weekly  teleconferences will be
              held with the faculty partner.  Final presentations will  be given at USM in
              the same summer-end meeting for the  first-summer students.       A total of 15
              students are planned for the USM program  each summer, 10 funded by NSF and 5
              by industrial grants  (10 X $2500 each).  Second-summer industrial stays will
              be  totally funded by industry, as will travel to USM for the  final program. 
              Each of 10 industrial partners will take 1  or 2 second-summer students,
              depending on attrition.  Student recruitment will build on existing strong
              programs  at USM, but will extend to include active participation by  industry
              in finding local and regional participants.  Minorities and women participants
              will be sought through  USM's extensive network of feeder schools and the 
              undergraduate recruitment office.  Projects will be jointly  developed by USM
              professors and industrial scientists, and  will involve basic exploration of
              real-world problems  (examples are included).  By year four of this project,
              the  10 industrial partner s will be asked to increase their  support (to $7500
              each) to make this a self-sustaining  program for training undergraduates for
              careers in the  polymer industry and graduate school.  ***
