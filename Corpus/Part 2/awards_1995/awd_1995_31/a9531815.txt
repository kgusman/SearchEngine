Abstract    :
              ***  9531815  Stiglich    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              Project will develop a commercially viable nano grained tungsten carbide
              composite for dies, cutting tools, drills and reamers, and drill bit inserts
              applications.  Phase I results were generally successful in demonstrating that
              50-100 nm WC grains could be dispersed in a 6 wt% Co matrix by solution
              chemistry.  The resulting powder, along with commercial "submicron" WC/ 6 wt%
              Co powders from three cutting tool companies, was consolidated by five
              different pressure assisted processes.  Four of them were "fast" - total
              process time densified all of the powders to 97% to 100% of theoretical
              density.  Microhardness data were compared among several commercial materials
              with the proposed material being the hardest at 2300 Vickers vs. 1600 to 1800
              for commercial materials. Phase II will accomplish the following objectives. 
              Commercial viability will be established by working with several industrial
              partners. A WC/Co composition will be developed including grain growth
              inhibitors (such as VC) which will be suitable for extrusion and sintering
              while maintaining the WC grain size achieved in Phase I.  Physical properties
              such as transverse rupture strength, fracture toughness, and wear resistance
              will be related to WC grain size and consolidation parameters.  Cutting tools
              of various types will be fabricated for commercial evaluation.  There are many
              wear parts, tool and die, and metal cutting applications for commercial carbide
              materials.  Besides single point tools there are miniatures (down to 250 to 500
              micron diameter) drills, reamers, etc. which are important for machining
              microcircuit boards.  ***
