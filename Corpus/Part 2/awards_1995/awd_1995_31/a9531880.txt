Abstract    :
              9531880    Davis    In conjunction with a companion project by Dr. Brechner
              Owens of the Woods   Hole Oceanographic Institution, 150 profiling ALACE
              (Autonomous Lagrangian And   Circulation Explorer) floats will measure the
              absolute velocity and evolution   of the temperature and salinity structure of
              the upper 1500 m in the subpolar   gyre as part of the Atlantic Circulation and
              Climate Experiment (ACCE).    Absolute velocities will be mapped at nominal
              depths of 400 and 1500 meters'   depth using float arrays deployed uniformly
              over the basin.  The velocity data   will address three major pathways of the
              meridional overturning circulation   (MOC) within the subpolar gyre: the
              shallow inflow of water into the regions   of water mass modification; the
              convection that forms new dense waters; and   the outflow of the resultant
              intermediate water from this source region.    Temperature and salinity
              profiling will describe time evolution of the upper   1500 m, allowing
              quantification of the rates of water-mass modification in the   warm-water limb
              of the MOC that supplies water for formation of deep and   intermediate water. 
              With 150 profiles observed roughly every ten days over   two years, these
              observations will describe evolution with a combined temporal   and spatial
              resolution greater than can be provided by all the other ACCE   observations,
              especially over the winter-time convection season when other   observations are
              extremely scarce.    Analysis of these data will provide time series of
              three-dimensional maps of   the velocity, temperature, and salinity fields
              within the upper 1500 m of the   subpolar gyre over the duration of the ACCE
              field experiment.  Additionally,   statistical analyses will provide spatial
              distributions of mean circulation   and quantities like eddy kinetic and
              potential energies, eddy mixing, and   fluxes of heat and freshwater. These
              gyre-wide estimates will provide strong  constraints for the future climate
              models that must be developed to adequately  include the  physics of the
              subpolar gyre, particularly convection.  The   absolute velocity measurements
              will also be used to reference large-scale   geostrophic shears obtained from
              hydrography in this region where strong  barotropic components are common.
