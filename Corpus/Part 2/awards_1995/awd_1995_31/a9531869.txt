Abstract    :
              9531869    Schmitt    In conjunction with companion projects by Drs. S. Riser of
              the University of   Washington and K. Leaman of the University of Miami,
              approximately 145   profiling P-ALACE (Profiling Autonomous Lagrangian And
              Circulation Explorer)   floats (at least half of them with salinity) will be
              used to study specific   water-mass transformation processes in the tropical
              and subtropical Atlantic   as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate
              Experiment (ACCE).  The basin-  wide grid will be used to provide relatively
              uniform sampling to track upper   layer salinity and heat content changes
              throughout the basin.   Higher   resolution arrays will be deployed in
              important local regions where water   masses such as the high-salinity
              Subtropical Underwater (Leaman), relatively   uniform 18-degree water (Riser)
              are formed or transformed, or where important   air-sea exchanges are highly
              variable such as under the ITCZ (Inter-Tropical   Convergence Zone) (R.
              Schmitt).  The higher-resolution will allow tracking of   seasonal and
              interannual changes in the volume and structure of the upper   ocean features,
              and relate these to modeled/observed estimates of surface heat   and fresh
              water fluxes.    Analysis of these data will provide time series of
              three-dimensional maps of   the velocity, temperature, and salinity fields
              within the upper 1500 m of the   tropical and subtropical gyres over the
              duration of the ACCE field experiment.    Additionally, statistical analyses
              will provide spatial distributions of mean   circulation and quantities like
              eddy kinetic and potential energies, and eddy   mixing, in addition to the flux
              estimates. These gyre-wide estimates will   provide strong constraints for the
              future climate models that must be   developed to adequately include the
              physics of the tropical and subtropical   Atlantic, particularly the fresh
              water budget.
