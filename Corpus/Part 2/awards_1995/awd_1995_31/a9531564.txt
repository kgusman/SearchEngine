Abstract    :
                DMI-9531564  Kosek  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II is
              directed at a method to significantly reduce the cost of fuel cells actively
              being developed as power sources for electric vehicles. A recently completed
              Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of inexpensive catalysts,
              containing very little noble metal, as H2 oxidation catalysts in a
              proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The catalyst is intended to replace
              the costly PI anode catalysts currently used in PEMFCs. Objectives of the Phase
              II program include (1) continued catalyst development, including investigation
              of methods to improve contaminant tolerance, (2) development of improved
              electrode structures to enhance PEMFC performance, particularly at high current
              density, (3) evaluate low-cost cathode catalysts containing little or no noble
              metal, and (4) to scale-up a PEMFC stack containing the low-cost catalysts in
              both stack height and active area. The program will culminate in continuous
              operation for 1000 hours of a 6-cell PEMFC stack, with each cell having a 160
              cm2 active area, containing the most promising anode and cathode catalyst. The
              development of inexpensive catalysts to replace the high Pt-content PEMFC
              catalyst would result in a significant reduction in PEMFC cost, increasing the
              economic competitiveness of PEMFC-powered vehicles with vehicles powered by
              Internal combustion engines.  Due to the recent mandates of California, and
              states in the Northeast requiring zero emission vehicles, there is potentially
              a large commercial market for PEMFCs with the low-cost anode catalyst. Fuel
              cells are also being considered for dispersed micro-cogeneration applications;
              the low-cost PEMFC is attractive for this application and other cogeneration
              applications. Military applications include mobile electric generators and
              transportation applications.  exchange membrane fuel cell, anode catalyst,
