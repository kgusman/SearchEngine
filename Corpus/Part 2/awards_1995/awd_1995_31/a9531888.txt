Abstract    :
              9531888  Poreda    This is a multiprong analyical investigation of the origin of
              the  Easter-Sala y Gomez seamount and island chain in the southeast  Pacific
              Ocean.  At present there are four models for the origin  of the chain: simple
              hotspot chain, leaky fracture zone, hot line  delineating the limbs of two
              ascending convection cells, and  plume-ridge interaction.  The principal
              investigators have  collected rocks containing fresh glass during two cruises
              to the  chain.  In this project they will obtain radiometric dates on the 
              samples and determine the chemical and isotopic composition of  the samples
