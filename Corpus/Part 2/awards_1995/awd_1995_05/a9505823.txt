Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9505823  Rosenberg  The University of
              Maryland will continue their studies of the high  magnetic latitude ionosphere
              and magnetosphere using galactic radio  noise absorption techniques (riometry).
               Several years ago, they  developed a new imaging riometer which allows the
              study of auroral  morphology during daylight and through clouds.  These imaging
               riometers are now being operated at Iqiluit, Canada;  Sondestromfjord,
              Greenland; and South Pole, Antarctica.   Additionally, they are operating broad
              beam riometers at Iqaluit,  McMurdo and South Pole as well as auroral
              photometers at McMurdo  and South Pole.  In the next few years they will
              provide part of  the hardware necessary to build imaging riometers at the
              British  Halley Bay and the Australian Davis stations, both in Antarctica, 
              thus considerably extending coverage.    The riometers work synergistically
              with a number of other  instruments which are operated at these sites by other 
              investigators.  A major focus of investigations over the next few  years will
              be the characterization of drifting polar auroral  patches and their
              relationship to polar cap convection.  ***
