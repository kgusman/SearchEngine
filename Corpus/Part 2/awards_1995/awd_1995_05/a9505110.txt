Abstract    :
              Dear Al,  Alex has kept me in the loop as you and he have converged on a revised
              scope of our proposed investigation into partitioning and ordering methods that
              take advantage of knowledge of coefficient magnitude, instead of coefficient
              structure only.  Thanks for your support of this work, whose outcomes could
              feed directly into several other projects.  To complete what I believe you need
              before processing this grant further, he and I have abstracted the project into
              the following two paragraphs for peers and nontechnical readers.  I hope it is
              okay.  Best Regards, David

              Solution-adaptive Grid Partitioning and Variable Ordering for PDEs  Alex Pothen
              and David E. Keyes   The proposers consider grid partitioning and variable
              ordering problems that come to the fore in the parallel computation of problems
              modeled by partial differential equations discretized on unstructured grids.
              Partitioning algorithms that maintain load balance among the processors while
              incurring low communication costs for distributed memory parallelism have been
              developed in earlier work.  Here solution-adaptive partitioning methods are
              proposed that strive, in addition, to attain good convergence rates in such
              data parallel contexts.  Communication volume per iteration may rise, but only
              modestly for moderate-granularity parallelism, while the more important number
              of message-startups per iteration should not be strongly affected.
              Solution-adaptive ordering methods are also proposed for the fast solution of
              the problems on the local partitions.  Two recently developed classes of
              partitioning and ordering algorithms that have proved to be successful in
              non-adaptive contexts will feature prominently in both the partitioning and
              ordering phases of this proposal.  One class consists of spectral algorithms,
              (i.e., algorithms that make use of an approximation to a certain eigenvector of
              a Laplacian matrix derived from the grid and the discretization sche me), while
              the second class includes multilevel algorithms.  Both algorithms will be
              generalized to the solution-adaptive context.  Many computational problems in
              science and engineering can be modeled by partial differential equations, and
              subsequently solved as a system of algebraic equations defined on an
              unstructured grid.  The most natural form of parallelism for such problems
              requires the original domain to be decomposed into subdomains, which are mapped
              whole on to individual processors.  Iterative domain decomposition algorithms
              fit naturally into this framework, wherein a solution is assembled from
              subproblems whose boundary conditions are set by transmitting a limited amount
              of information between nearest neighbors.  The partitioning and ordering
              methods proposed herein will be useful for solution methods of such domain
              decomposition type, which are designed with respect for the high
              communication-to-computation cost ratio in contemporary distributed-memory
              computers.  The key opportunity to be exploited in this work is that of
              synergistically joining two ideas that have matured separately, and are usually
              used as ``black boxes''-- partitioning and ordering based on sparsity structure
              only, and domain-blocked iteration based on understanding the physical
              dependencies reflected in the coefficients.  The software tools developed in
              this work will be demonstrated for ``grand challenge'' problems in application
              areas such as aerodynamics and geophysics.
