Abstract    :
              9505450  MADDOCKS       It is proposed to investigate recent progress in
              advanced  theoretical dynamics within the context of the practical  mechanics
              problems that arise in the determination and control of  the attitude dynamics
              of artificial satellites.  The project will  be carried out in collaboration
              with Computer Sciences  Corporation (CSC).  The underlying motivation is that a
               postdoctoral associate could facilitate and exploit a two-way  transfer of
              technology in which the modern analytical and  numerical expertise that is
              available in the University, is  tested in the light of the expertise available
              at CSC, namely an  extensive knowledged of traditional mechanics approaches,
              and of  practical questions that arise in flying satellites.  The project  will
              comprise case studies of specific operational satellites and  comparison with
              actual flight data.  The mathematical techniques  that will be considered
              include applications of i) the non-  canonical Hamiltonian formulation of
              Arnol'd to predict so-called  gravity-gradient and other perturbation effects
              on the attitude  dynamics of satellites, ii) modern Hamiltonian formulations of
               rod models to describe the dynamics of antennas and booms, and  iii)
              applications of symplectic and energy-momentum integrator in  high accuracy
              numerical simulations.  The associated physical  effects to be investigated
              will include i) coupling between  attitude and orbit dynamics due to finite
              satellite size, and  internal and external damping, ii) spin-up dynamics and 
              instability resonances, and especially iii) effects of  flexibility of
              satellites.  The final objective is improved  understanding of the attitude
              dynamics of satellites that will  lead to robust, efficient and accurate
              numerical simulations.
