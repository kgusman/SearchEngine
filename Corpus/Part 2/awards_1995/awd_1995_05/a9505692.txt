Abstract    :
              Dr. Gregory L. Hillhouse, Chemistry Department, University of Chicago, is  
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program of the Chemistry Division to develop metal mediated reactions of  
              nitrous oxide and related species. The oxo and imido insertion reactions   of
              nitrous oxide and organoazides will be utilized to synthesize a series   of
              late transition metal hydroxides, alkoxides, and imides. The metal   systems
              will be chosen so that reductive elimination reactions will   result in the
              clean formation of cyclic organic molecules that contain   oxygen or nitrogen
              heteroatoms. Systems will be constructed in which the   metal catalyzes these
              transformations.  One of today's greatest chemical challenges is the selective
              oxidation of   organic substrates. A very attractive oxidant is nitrous oxide,
              a   molecule which liberates only nontoxic and environmentally friendly  
              nitrogen gas after it serves as an oxygen transfer agent. Moreover,   nitrous
              oxide is recognized as both a `greenhouse gas` and a   stratospheric `ozone
              depleter`;  it would be advantageous to find new   uses for this gas, which is
              now an underutilized biproduct of the   chemical industry. In this project
              metal systems will be designed to   activate nitrous oxide toward oxygen atom
              transfer reactions and metal   catalysts will be developed to facilitate these
              reactions. As a result   new uses for nitrous oxide and some related species
              will be developed.
