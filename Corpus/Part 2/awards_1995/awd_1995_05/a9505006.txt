Abstract    :
              9505006  Wilkerson       Ever since work of Serre in the 1950's, algebraic
              topology has  often been studied one prime at a time.  This idea, borrowed from
               algebra and number theory, has resulted in new questions being  raised.  For
              example, what does it mean for a topological space to  be a Lie group at a
              particular prime p?  One can answer with a  reformulation that combines the
              group structure on G and the  topological structure on G into a single
              classifying space, BG.   Further abstraction of the properties true for all BG
              leads to the  definition of a p-compact group which is a suitable homotopical 
              analogue of a Lie group at the prime p.  Remarkably, these  p-compact groups
              possess analogues of standard Lie theoretical  constructions such as maximal
              tori, Weyl groups, and root systems.   The goal is to use these structures to
              produce a classification  that is similar in spirit to the classification of
              compact  connected Lie groups, but different in detail.  A by-product would  be
              the complete solution to the Steenrod question (1961) of which  spaces have
              mod-p cohomology algebras that are finitely generated  polynomial rings.      
              Algebraic topology studies geometric objects by abstracting  more tractable
              algebraic information.  One rich source of such data  is the group of
              symmetries of a geometric configuration.  These so-  called Lie groups, after
              the 19th century analyst and geometer,  Sophus Lie, have had profound
              applications in algebra, physics, and  number theory.  One advantage of
              algebraic topology and homotopy  theory is that its natural tools, such as
              homology and homotopy  groups, are impervious to small deformations or changes
              in the  geometric structure under study.  The goal of this work is to  create a
              classification of the homotopical analogues of Lie groups  by the study of the
              algebraic topology of their classifying spaces.  ***
