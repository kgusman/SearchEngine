Abstract    :
              The vascular flora of the Greater Antilles contains perhaps 10,000 species, a
              rich resource for fundamental ecological and systematic studies as well as for
              the immediate demands of biotechnology, conservation and environmental biology.
               However, only a single, severely dated reference exists that covers the entire
              region.  The Flora of the Greater Antilles project has been initiated by the
              New York Botanical Garden and the Smithsonian Institution.  Its goal is to
              produce a complete monographic flora of vascular plants, cryptogams and fungi. 
              This multivolume product will be published in the Memoirs of the New York
              Botanical Garden. The Orchidaceae has been targeted for early treatment in the
              Flora series.  The family represents a large portion of the vascular flora of
              the Greater Antilles, 6-7%, and is represented by at least 660 species native
              or naturalized to the region.  The objectives of this project are to (1)
              initiate an intensive collecting program, particularly in areas that are poorly
              known, in areas of high endemism, and of difficult and underrepresented groups;
              (2) vis it herbaria and libraries with important  historical collections; (3)
              prepare an illustrated monographic treatment of the family for Flora of  the
              Grater Antilles (Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden); and (4) establish
              an electronically  available database of information on which the treatment
              will be based.  All of approximately 109  genera will be covered in a single
              volume. The final product will serve to clarify and stabilize  taxonomy of the
              region, and will be a standard reference for those conducting future floristic,
               taxonomic, ecological and evolutionary studies.  The specimen database
              produced will offer greater  detail than can be provided by the printed flora. 
              Both products will serve as a guide for land use  planners and conservation
              biologists faced with critical decisions in areas where social and political 
              pressures for habitat exploitation are severe.
