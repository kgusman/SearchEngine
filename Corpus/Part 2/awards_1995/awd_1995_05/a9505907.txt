Abstract    :
              9505907   Gilbert  Successful development of the first cell-free system in which
              DNA replication is preferentially initiated at a physiologically utilized
              origin of replication has been achieved by this laboratory. These initial
              observations will be fully investigated by using a combination of cell and
              molecular biological tools to identify the components of nuclear structure that
              designate an origin of replication.  Specific aims are: 1. To determine if
              origins of replication are designate at the time of nuclear assembly, 2. To
              determine if pre-designated origins in Gl nuclei are disrupted by a Xenopus
              early cleavage mitotic cycle, 3. To determine if the mammalian nuclear membrane
              is necessary for site-specific initiation of replication in Xenopus egg
              extracts.  %%%  DNA replication is central to the life cycle of every living
              organism and, although much is known about the process in simple organisms, the
              regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes are largely unknown.  DNA
              replication initiates within defined chromosomal loci in eukaryotic cells but
              naked DNA in systems derived from metazoan organisms do not have any such
              requirements. This proposal describes a novel approach based upon the
              hypothesis that DNA replication in metazoan chromosomes is regulated by aspects
              of nuclear structure that cannot be easily reconstructed when starting with
              cloned DNA templates. Cell-free extracts from Xenopus eggs provide an excellent
              model system in which to test the hypothesis that the structural and functional
              organization of the nucleus is crucial in regulating DNA replication.  ***  ??
