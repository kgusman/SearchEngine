Abstract    :
              9505950  Baldwin    Many native plants increase the concentration of toxic
              metabolites in their tissues when they are attacked by herbivores.  While
              understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these responses has advanced
              rapidly, understanding of their significance remains limited.  Do these
              wound-induced responses function as defenses, making plants more resistant to
              further attack?  If these responses protect plants, why are the defenses
              inducibly deployed?  Two classes of theories have been proposed to explain
              inducibility: 1) theories which assume that the inducible trait is a
              cost-savings measure which reduces the resource cost of defense by allowing
              plants to time the allocation of resources to defense with the need for
              defense, and 2) theories which do not make this assumption.  This research
              examines these questions by testing both the benefits and the costs of an
              induced alkaloidal defense to plant fitness in the field by using 1) a recently
              identified damage signal which activates the induced defense, and 2) an
              inhibitor of enzymes responsible for producing the damage signal, which will
              allow suppression of the induced defense in attacked plants.    The results of
              this work will be important for the development of sustainable agricultural
              practices by developing approaches to pest resistance that move away from the
              exogenous addition of pesticides.  Transgenic technology has greatly
              facilitated the ability to move potent resistance traits among different
              species and controlling the expression of these traits in crop plants. 
              Understanding the costs and benefits of different types of expression is
              essential if these new traits are to be sustainable in agriculture.
