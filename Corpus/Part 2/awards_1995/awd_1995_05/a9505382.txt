Abstract    :
              DMI-9505382  Bai  The objective of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase
              II project is to develop and demonstrate zeolite based inorganic membrane
              modules that carry out gas separations using a molecular sieving mechanism. In
              Phase I, TDA Research Inc. (TDA) developed the techniques necessary to grow
              dense continuous films of ZSM-5. ZSM-5 films were successfully grown on single
              crystal silica and alumina substrates. The films were approximately 100 Am
              thick and remained bonded to the substrate even when thermally cycled. ZSM-5
              films were then grown on porous silica discs. Before calcination, the films
              were found to be gas tight. Following calcination, permeation measurements were
              carried out using Ar, N2, i-C4H,o, and SF6 as the test gases. The membranes
              were adherent, defect free, and the permeance data and calculated separation
              factors were consistent with a molecular sieving mechanism.  In the Phase II
              project, TDA will develop techniques to coat Membralox alumina monoliths in
              order to develop efficient cost effective inorganic gas separation membranes.
              In order to improve the gas separation properties of the membranes, the pore
              sizes will be optimized using chemical means. Nineteen channel Membralox
              alumina modules will be modified with ZSM-5 and mordenite films, the pore sizes
              optimized for selected gas separations, and the performance of the module will
              be evaluated.  Zeolite membranes have high separation ratios, extremely high
              fluxes, and can operate in high temperature and aggressive chemical
              environments that would destroy polymeric membranes. Therefore, zeolite
              modified alumina membranes will find their first applications in gas
              separations under aggressive conditions. Other potential high value
              applications include use as solid electrolytes in advanced bakeries, as
              selective films in chemical sensors, and in advanced optical and electronic
              devices.
