Abstract    :
              ***  9505294  Entine         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will complete the technical development of high performance arrays of
              sophisticated optical sensors, capable of' detecting the very fast, very low
              light level signals generated by the interaction of high energy particles with
              fiber optic detectors.  Some of the most ambitious projects in the history of
              scientific research are now being undertaken at high luminosity particle
              accelerator facilities at various sites around the globe.  Central to the
              success of these endeavors are the availability of detectors such as those
              proposed.   Presently the only technology capable of achieving the required
              optical performance is a system of detectors which require extremely cumbersome
              and expensive cryogenic cooling to liquid helium temperatures.  As a result of
              the Phase I research, a new technology has been invented which should greatly
              reduce the expense and challenge of detecting the faint optical signals central
              to such scientific quests.  This technology consists of arrays of unique, super
              high gain avalanche photodiodes with such low noise that they can operate at
              temperatures near -50 degrees C, a temperature range which can be economically
              reached with little difficulty.  In Phase II, research will be conducted to
              move this device, whose performance has been characterized and found to exceed
              initial expectations, to the point where it will be ready for immediate
              incorporation at many high energy facilities.       These new optical sensors
              are so sensitive that they will be useful for a wide array of optical
              applications including large high energy physics systems, satellite aiming and
              communication and fiber optic data systems.  ***
