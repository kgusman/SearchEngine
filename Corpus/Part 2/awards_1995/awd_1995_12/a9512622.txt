Abstract    :
                    The specific aim of this proposal is to obtain funding to upgrade  two NMR
              instruments, General Electric GN-500 (500 MHz) and Bruker  WM-250 (250 MHz)
              spectrometers, in the NMR facility of the Department  of Chemistry through the
              replacement of The GN-500 console with a new  state-of-the-art console (Varian
              Unity plus 500 MHz console) and the  purchase of a new 300 MHz spectrometer
              (Varian GEMINI 2000) to replace  the WM-250 instrument. The proposed UNITY plus
              500 console and  accessories, with existing 500 MHz superconducting magnet, has
              the  capability for conducting state-of-the-are NMR experiments on liquid  and
              solid state samples. The complete GEMINI 2000 300 MHz spectrometer  with
              accessories is equipped for conducting modern NMR experiments for  the
              characterization of molecules by researchers in the various  sub-disciplines of
              chemistry on a routine basis. The justification for  this application rests
              first on the need for modern NMR instrumentation  to carry out the large amount
              of NMR research done by departmental  faculty. Five faculty will be the major
              users on the 500 MHz  spectrometer. Three members do biochemical studies which
              require modern  500 MHz capability. One is examining the structures of 
              metallobleomycins bound to DNA oligomers, which relate to the prototype 
              chemical nuclease iron bleomycin. Another is involved with  environmentally
              relevant work on the structure of lobster cadmium  metallothionein and its
              relationship to mammalian metallothioneins. The  third studies
              structure-reactivity relations in iron-sulfur proteins. A  physical chemist
              does solid state NMR studies of industrially important  catalytic surfaces and
              requires 500 MHz capability for solid state NMR  studies. The fifth faculty
              member uses NMR spectroscopy extensively to  characterize complex synthetic
              organic molecules. Additional faculty  require routine NMR spectroscopy from
              the facility, primarily to  determine the structures of newly synthesized
              moleculeq. In addition,  it will be used by se veral research chemists from
              industries in the  Milwaukee area for QC and structural analysis. In this
              context, the  present instruments acquired in 1981 and 1986, respectively, are
              badly  out of date and can not adequately serve current needs for 
              state-of-the-art multidimensional NMR experimentation as well as high  quality
              routine 2D NMR work. Thus, it is necessary to upgrade both  instruments so that
              sufficient NMR time is available on each  spectrometer to service faculty
              needs.          It is also important to have a modern 500 MHz instrument so
              that  the department can attract a faculty member in biological NMR 
              spectroscopy to replace a professor in this area who resigned in 1994  because
              of the lack of such instrumentation, moving to another  institution where such
              equipment is available. Finally, with the  coordinated purchase of the new
              console and a 300 MHz spectrometer, it  will be possible to train students
              routinely in the basic elements of  experimental multidimensional NMR
              spectroscopy on the new 300 MHz  spectrometer without the need to crowd the
              schedule of the 500 MHz  instrument with this essential task. In so doing, the
              department's  graduate course in pulsed NMR can be coordinated with a much
              needed  laboratory for the enrolled students.          Modern NMR spectroscopy
              is a central tool for chemists. Faculty  research and recruitment and student
              training in the Department of  Chemistry at the University of
              Wisconsin-Milwaukee has been  increasingly inhibited by the inadequacies of its
              NMR instrumentation.  The present proposal is submitted to remedy these
              fundamental problems.
