Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tim White will purchase a four
              wheel drive Toyota Landcruiser. Dr. White and his collaborators conduct NSF
              supported paleoanthropological field research in the Middle Awash region of
              Ethiopia. Because there are no roads in this region and the rugged nature of
              the terrain, four wheel drive vehicles provide the only feasible means of
              ground transportation. Given the multidisciplinary nature of the work and the
              number of investigators involved, the team is critically short of field
              vehicles and this purchase will allow the research to proceed in a more
              efficient manner.  The Middle Awash paleoanthropological research project is a
              multidisciplinary effort whose objective is the elucidation of human origins
              and evolution. The research area contains a succession of fossiliferous
              sediments spanning the last six million years. Recent finds have established
              the Middle Awash as one of the world's most important paleoanthropological
              areas and the project is devoted to recovering evidence for early hominid
              origins and evolution and placing this evidence in precisely controlled
              spatial, temporal and environmental contexts. In 1992 and 1993 the team
              recovered evidence of the earliest hominid species Australopithecus ramidus. In
              1994 the site of Aramis yielded the oldest partial skeleton of a human ancestor
              yet recovered.  This research is clearly important and productive. Purchase of
              an additional vehicle will make it more so.
