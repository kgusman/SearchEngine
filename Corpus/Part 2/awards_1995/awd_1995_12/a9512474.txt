Abstract    :
              9512474  Hull    A focused ion beam (FIB) instrument will be acquired for 
              research in materials science and biological applications. This  instrument
              produces high current density, highly collimated  beams of positive gallium
              ions at energies in the range between  5 and 30 kiloelectron volts. Such beams
              can be used to sputter,  pattern, or deposit on scales of less than 100
              nanometers.  These processes can be viewed dynamically via imaging with 
              secondary electrons or ions. Specific applications include: (1)  micromachining
              of transmission electron microscopy samples for  electronic device degradation
              studies; (2) nanoscale imaging of  dopant distribution in semiconductors; (3)
              mesoscopic  lithography for a wide range of low power and high frequency 
              semiconductor electronic devices and metal/superconductor  heterostructures and
              tunneling devices; (4) tomographic imaging  of intracellular structure in
              biological materials.  %%%  This research incorporates elements which define
              broad new  applications for focused ion beam instrumentation such as  dopant
              mapping and tomographic imaging of biological materials.  These novel
              applications can potentially encourage and  accelerate the development of the
              technique. In addition, the  direct visualization of sputtering and deposition
              processes can  enhance teaching methods in courses relating to electronic 
              materials processing and microelectronic device manufacturing.  ***
