Abstract    :
              In this application we describe research programs in  structural biology at two
              different institutions, each of  which requires the ability to  analyze data
              obtained from our high resolution electron  microscopes. In order to be able to
              fully utilize the  capabilities of our EM Facilities and to overcome a major 
              gap in the technological resources available to the life  sciences communities
              at Brandeis University and at Boston  University School of Medicine, we are
              proposing to purchase  a high resolution precision microdensitometer scanning 
              system.      Considerable effort has been devoted to insure that   the
              Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center (the     Center) and BUSM,
              Department of Biophysics have the EM    facilities necessary to pursue
              high-resolution structural     studies. Over the past few years several
              projects have          developed specimens extremely well suited for      
              Cystallographic and single particle study using EM   techniques. Optical
              diffraction of film recorded EM images       and/or direct observation of film
              recorded electron    diffraction patterns of a variety of these specimens have 
               indicated that the information content of much of this data    is great and
              that Programs for high-resolution structural                   determination
              are feasible.                                  Central to working with any film
              recorded data  is the ability to convert this information into digital form    
              for computer-based processing and analysis. In neither   institution is there
              currently a device able to digitize EM    film recorded data in a form suitable
              for high-resolution    structural studies. (The digitization equipment
              currently      available is inadequate even for moderate resolution   studies.)
              The few EM based high-resolution reconstructions    performed on biological
              samples (bacteriorhodopsin, light                           harvesting  complex
              and porin) in other laboratories were exclusively           determined with
              data (images and diffraction            patterns) digitized through precision  
                      microdensitometers. Both the Center's high  resolution electron
              microscopes (Philips CM12 and          Model 420) are routinely providing high 
              resolution images for our structural biology research           programs.
              However, in order to digitize these  images for computer analysis it has been  
                      necessary for our investigators to travel to  Albany, NY as there are
              no suitable scanners in New           England. The instrument of choice for
              this  application is currently being manufactured by           Orbital Sciences
              Corporation (Pomona, CA). It  is a flat-bed microdensitometer and is
              essentially           identical to the Perkin-Elmer instrument which  is no
              longer manufactured. It is widely regarded           as the state-of-the-art
              instrument for image  digitization and far exceeds the capabilities of our     
                   current scanner. The technique used in the           Orbital 
              microdensitometer system is almost           completely free of optical
              aberrations and  produces high fidelity data. The major advantage of          
              this instrument is that an illuminated area of  the specimen is optically
              projected onto a sample           defining aperture as small as 3~m. Only that 
              light which passes through the aperture is measured         and digitized.
              Scanning is accomplished by  laterally translating the specimen relative to the
                      optical axis. The aperture maintains a fixed  location on the optical
              axis, thereby minimizing           distortions and the effects of optical      
                  aberrations.  The Center's only available instrument is an          
              Eikonix digitizer which operates by projecting  a real image of the specimen to
              be digitized using        a 35mm photographic lens. This real image is 
              digitized via a linear photodiode array which is           translated across
              the image plane. This           approach,  though relatively inexpensive, is
              subject to a           multitude of optical and mechanical defects.  The 
              Eikonix scanner cannot support our high           resolution structural studies
              reliably.
