Abstract    :
              9512009  Altonji  The question of whether private schools are more effective
              than  public schools is at the center of the current national debate  over the
              role of vouchers, charter schools, and other reforms  that would increase
              choice in education.  The question has been  the subject of much controversy
              among researchers.  If private  schools do in fact provide better education at
              lower cost, then  the case for expansion of choice in schooling is
              strengthened.   Since Catholic schools account for about two thirds of private 
              school enrollment in the U.S., assessing the effectiveness of  Aatholic schools
              is an important part of the assessment of  private schooling.  The disagreement
              surrounding the effects of  Catholic schools on achievement scores and other
              outcomes centers  around the problem of nonrandom selection into Catholic
              schools.  This project will investigate how Catholic school effects vary  with
              individual characteristics such as race, gender, parental  education, family
              income, and with neighborhood characteristics  and school characteristics.  The
              project will address the  selection problem for Catholic schools by taking
              advantage of the  fact that proximity to Catholic schools has a strong effect
              on  the probability of Catholic school attendance for Catholics but  not for
              non-Catholics.  This permits the use of the interaction  between religious
              preference and proximity to Catholic schools to  statistically identify
              Catholic school effects.      Separate controls for both proximity and
              religious preference  will be used.  The approach will be implemented using the
               National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972,  which reports
              zipcode of resident, and the Panel Study of Income   Dynamics, which reports
              Census tract.  The project will take  advantage of an education supplement in
              the 1995 PSID the  provides information about type of school attended and the 
              extension of the PSID  geocode  data through 1994.  The panel  data sets will
              be matched to information on th e neighborhood and   community, local public
              schools, and the distance to and  characteristics of the nearest Catholic
              schools.  Various  instrumental variables and  control function  estimators
              will be   used to estimate Catholic school effects, with the interaction 
              between religious preferences and proximity as the key exogenous   variable.
