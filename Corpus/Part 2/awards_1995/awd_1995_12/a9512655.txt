              Chang  PRIVATE    The broad goal of this project is to understand the mechanism
              of amino terminal processing of eukaryotic proteins. The approach used is the
              purification, characterization and genetic analysis of two methionine
              aminopeptidases (MAPs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The first aim is to
              elucidate the roles of yeast MAP1 in amino terminal processing and cell growth.
              Yeast MAP 1 contains two zinc fingers and a cobalt dependent catalytic domain.
              To understand the roles of MAP1 in this processing event, this investigator
              plans to study the roles of the zinc fingers and cobalt ions in MAP1 function.
              The results will show whether MAP1 is ribosome associated, and if so, how
              deletion of zinc fingers affects thi s interaction The P.I. also plans to
              compare the efficiency of methionine removal of several model proteins in yeast
              cells that express no MAP1, truncated MAP1 which lacks zinc fingers, and wild
              type MAP1 and to elucidate the roles of cobalt in MAP1 function by determining
              the cobalt binding constant and studying the effects of mutations at the cobalt
              binding sites on cell growth and enzyme activity. The second aim is to
              elucidate the roles of is MAP2 in N terminal processing and to determine
              whether it is a bifunctional protein. The P.I. plans to purify and characterize
              this enzyme, to compare its substrate specificity and other properties with
              those of MAP1, and to knock out the MAP2 gene alone and both MAPl and MAP2
              genes, and characterize the phenotype of the knockout yeast strains. Amino
              terminal processing is one of the most common protein processing events, which
              occurs in all living cells and is essential for normal cell growth. Yet, until
              recently, very little was known about the mechanism by which this important
              processing event is carried out in eukaryotic cells, and how it is regulated.
              This study should provide novel insights into the mechanism and regulation of
              this important event, which in turn may lead to better understanding of the
              regulation of protein synthesis and the regulation of the functions of
              myristoylated proteins, including certain oncogene products, viral proteins,
              and proteins involved in transmembrane signaling and protein secretory
              vesicular trafficking. %%% This research project is focused on studying the
              mechanism of the removal of the initial amino acid from the origin of a protein
              called the N terminus. This is one of the most common systems for modifying
              newly made proteins. The generality of this phenomenon in proteins from
              microbes to man indicates its fundamental importance to all living organisms.
              Yet, relatively little is known about the mechanism by which this initial amino
              acid is removed, particularly in higher organisms like man, or the manner in wh
              ich this process is regulated. The Principal Investigator has already made
              considerable progress in developing the problem. He has found two enzymes which
              are specific for removing the N terminal methionine (the initial amino acid)
              from newly synthesized proteins as they are produced in eukaryotic cells. The
              next immediate goal of his research is to fully characterize these interesting
              proteins, so called methionine aminopeptidases (MAPs), that are important to
              every living cell. It is certain that understanding the novel features of yeast
              MAPs will provide new insights into the mechanism and the regulation of this
              cellular event that is essential for cell growth. ***
