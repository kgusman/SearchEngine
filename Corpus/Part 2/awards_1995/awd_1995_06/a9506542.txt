              Dissertation Improvement  Research: Flexible Specialization and Specialty Wood
              Products in the Rural Northwest   This project  identifies several groups of
              specialty wood products producers in a four-state Northwest region and 
              examines firm behavior within and between clusters.  The study will develop
              important empirical  knowledge about the shape of flexible specialization in
              this prominent rural industry and lead to the  development of theory relevant
              to the conditions found in the Northwest wood products industry.  Most  recent
              research on flexible specialization has concentrated on  change in urban mass
              production  industries.  This proposal examines how clusters of rural firms may
              be generating collective  efficiencies.  The goal is to make a significant
              contribution to understanding the nature of  industrial diversification in this
              peripheral and largely non-industrialized region in this age of  industrial
              flexibility.
