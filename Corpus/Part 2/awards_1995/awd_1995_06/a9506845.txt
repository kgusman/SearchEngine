Abstract    :
              9506845  Jameson  The goal of this research are to elucidate and characterize
              the conformational dynamics of ribosomal proteins.  The specific systems to be
              studied include the Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins L7/L12 and L10, free
              and reconstituted into ribosomal subunits. Cysteine residues, specifically
              placed at appropriate locations along the peptide chain by site-directed
              mutagenesis techniques, will be labeled with various sulfhydryl specific
              fluorescence probes.  Neither L7/L12 nor L10 have intrinsic tryptophan residues
              and hence this intrinsic fluorophore can also be introduced at appropriate
              locations in these proteins.  Fluorescence methods, including time-resolved and
              energy transfer techniques, will then be utilized to elucidate flexibility and
              relative motion of different domains of L7/L12, free in solution, in its
              pentameric complex with L10 in the 50s ribosomal subunit and in the intact 70s
              ribosome.  Flexibility of various double mutants of L7/L12 with deletion of a
              putative hinge region will also be studied to ascertain the contribution of
              this stretch of amino acids to the protein's overall conformational dynamics. 
              Fluorescence energy transfer techniques will be utilized to elucidate distances
              between various sites on L7/L12 both free and in its complexes with L10 and
              reconstituted into the ribosomal subunits.  The energetics of subunit
              interactions between the L7/L12 monomers will be studied by polarization and
              energy transfer methods.  These studies will be aimed at elucidating the
              thermodynamic aspects of the dimer/monomer equilibrium of L7/12 as well as
              studying subunit exchange between L7/L12 free in solution and in its various
              complexes.  These biophysical approaches will afford a better understanding of
              subunit interactions and conformational dynamics of L7/L12, both isolated and
              associated with other ribosomal components.  This information will begin to
              provide a dynamic description of the ribosome which is ultimately necessary for
              detailed understanding of the coord inated chemical and physical processes
              involved in protein biosynthesis.  %%%  The goal is to study the structure and
              dynamics of ribosomal proteins using fluorescence techniques.  These
              biophysical approaches will provide a better understanding of subunit
              interactions and conformation dynamics of ribosomal components.  This
              information will begin to provide a dynamic description of the ribosome which
              is ultimately necessary for detailed understanding of the coordinated chemical
              and physical process involved in protein bi synthesis.  In addition to the
              knowledge this research program will provide on an important biological
              problem, it will also contribute to the infrastructure of science education in
              the United States by allowing the training of undergraduate, graduate and
              postdoctoral students.  ***  ??
