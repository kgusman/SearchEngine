Abstract    :
              9506425  Stute    One of key questions in paleoclimate research is the degree of
              change in tropical surface temperatures between today and the last glacial
              maximum (LGM).  Most sea surface temperature records suggest small (<1oC)
              glacial/interglacial temperature changes, while continental records indicate
              considerably larger temperature changes.  A resolution of this conflict is
              crucial for a reliable reconstruction of past and prediction of future climate
              change.  We plan to address this issue by improving the continental climate
              record in the tropics at low altitude, which at this stage is less quantitative
              than the sea surface temperature record.  We will use the concentrations of
              atmospheric noble gases dissolved in groundwater as paleothermometer ('noble
              gas thermometer') and confined aquifer as archive of climate change. We request
              funds for collection and evaluation of geochemical data (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, 14
              C,  13 C, D , 18 O   34 S   and major dissolved ions) from two groundwater flow
              systems in the tropics, the Mekong Delta aquifers in southern Vietnam and the
              Rio Guayas aquifers in Ecuador.  Noble gas paleotemperature records from these
              aquifers will allow quantitative reconstruction of paleotemperature records for
              the continental tropics covering the past 30,000 years.  The aquifers are
              located at altitudes less than 100 aaaaam a.s.l. and close to the eastern and
              western coasts of the Pacific.  The records obtained from these aquifers will
              therefore allow us to directly compare  continental and oceanic
              paleotemperatures during the last glaciation.
