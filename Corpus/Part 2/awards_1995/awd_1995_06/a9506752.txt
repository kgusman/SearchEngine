Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    EAR-9506752  Feng    A commonly used climatic indicator in
              continental paleoclimatic studies is inferred oxygen and hydrogen isotopic
              compositions of paleometeoric water either by direct measurements, such as
              polar ice, or by using proxy indicators, such as lake sediments, soil
              carbonates, cave deposits, vein calcite, and tree rings.  Because climatic
              indicators are rarely single-variable functions of meteoric water, the climatic
              reconstructions are not always consistent.  In particular, groundwater samples
              dating back to the Last Glacial Maximum are typically depleted in deuterium
              relative to worldwide Holocene recharge, while waters inferred from wood
              cellulose is typically enriched in deuterium.      This project attempts to
              resolve the cause(s) and mechanisms of this observational discrepancy.  The
              main approach is to locate meteoric recharge zones known to be responsible for
              some of the paleogroundwaters that have been described, and find and analyze
              wood samples known to have grown in the same area. If the disagreement between
              Pleistocene groundwater and Pleistocene wood is confirmed, then it may imply
              fundamental differences in climatic parameters between the Last Glacial Maximum
              and the Holocene.  Emphasis during the Planning Grant will be placed on finding
              appropriate sites for the study.  The focus will be on the north-central and
              central U.S, where paleogroundwater and ancient wood samples are well
              documented, and North China, where Pleistocene water is widely distributed. 
              Because the discrepancy between groundwater and wood is a large-scale
              observation, the causes must be large scale phenomena.  Thus, this project
              should make fundamental contributions to the understanding of the climate and
              environment.
