Abstract    :
              9506997  Gough  This proposal is for holding a workshop to address the
              development  of a sustained advanced light source research program aimed at 
              building the scientific basis for major long range breakthroughs in  light
              source performance and efficiency.  Qualified researchers in  the basic
              sciences related to light sources technologies will be  brought together with
              world-wide experts now working in light  source research to discuss, plan and
              prioritize the sustained  research programs needed to achieve the major
              breakthroughs.  The  goals are to:  (1) educate participants from the basic
              research  community in the current state of the art in light source  technology
              and research; (2) provides a vehicle for the  participants to explore both
              single focused as well as  interdisciplinary research programs that would
              provide the basis  for the breakthroughs; (3) jointly establish specific
              programs and  priorities for collaborative effort and funding.    There will be
              approximately 60 participants.  The workshop will  take place over a two and
              one-half day period.  The findings and  recommendations regarding new research
              directions will be  documented in a workshop proceedings.  The outcome of the
              workshop  is expected to lead to multiple sourcing of funds for the targeted 
              research from both private industry as well as from interested  government
              agencies.  ***
