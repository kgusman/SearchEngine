              9506798 Sutko     Calcium release channels, known as ryanodine receptors (RyR)
              are present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of muscle cells, and they
              release the calcium that triggers muscle contraction.  Two RyR isoforms are
              co-expressed in vertebrate skeletal muscles, and two mechanisms have been
              proposed to act in concert to activate SR Ca++ release in these muscles.  One
              mechanisms, directly coupled Ca ++ release (DCCR) involves interactions between
              a RyR and the dihyropryidine receptor (DHPR) Ca++ channel acting as a voltage
              sensor. In the second mechanism, calcium induced calcium release (CICR) , a RyR
              channel is activated by Ca++ released by DCCR.  This project will test the
              hypotheses that each RyR isoform is activated by one of these mechanisms, the 
              (RyR isoform by DCCR, and the (RyR isoform by CICR.   The involvement of the
              (RyR in DCCR involves association with DHPR, therefore biochemical and
              immunological approaches will be used  to lomk for this association and to see
              if this association involves the SR protein triadin. A peptide from the
              cytoplasmic loop of the DHPR will b e tested to see if it can activate the
              (RyR. In bilayer studies the  (RyR is inactivated by Ca++ in the absence, but
              not the presence of mMATP,  so caged ATP in single muscle fibers will be used
              to test if  RyRs are liganded by ATP and subject to inactivation by high Ca++.
              %%%  The results of these studies will provide new information on how a SR Ca++
              release system based on two ryanodine receptors, operates to support the
              functions of vertebrate skeletal muscles. ***
