Abstract    :
              9506103  Eissenberg   Genes which are relocated to heterochromatin experience
              position dependent silencing, termed "position effect variegation" (PEV) in
              Drosophila. PEV will be used as a "tracer" for mitotically stable gene
              repression to test the working hypothesis that heterochromatin mediated gene
              silencing is initiated in early embryogenesis and actively regulated during
              development of the fly. A novel assay has been developed for PEV:transgenic
              flies that variegate for an inducible gene (lacZ under heat shock control). The
              assay will be used to test the stability of the heterochromatic silencing link
              to the mitotic cell cycle; it will be used to test the effects of genetic
              modifiers on developmental timing or tissue specificity of PEV; and, finally,
              the effects of ecdysone and activators/inhibitors of post-translational protein
              modification on gene silencing will also be tested.  %%%  The ability to study
              the linkage between the position of a gene on a chomosome and its ability to be
              expressed offers an opportunity to investigate the developmental regulation of
              heterochromatic gene silencing in a higher eukaryotic organism. Genes which are
              expressing are normally found in the chromosomal regions known as euchromatin.
              If they are moved to what is called the heterochomatic region of a chromosome,
              they are silenced.  The proposed studies are aimed at determining the role of a
              number of developmental and genetic factors in the stable propagation of
              heterochromatic silencing in the fruit fly, Drosophila.  ***
