Abstract    :
              9530516   Crosley     This project addresses both atmospheric processes and
              measurement techniques for atmospheric trace species, and employs both
              experiments and modeling. The four main components are: 1) Quenching of
              rotational levels of electronically excited hydroxyl radical near the
              predissociation limit, and the measurement of nascent hydroxyl distributions in
              multiphoton laser dissociation of water and nitric acid. These distributions
              are pertinent to the analysis of water and nitric acid in the atmosphere using
              laser photofragmentation. 2) The ultraviolet absorption spectra of nitric acid
              could be very different in cold matrices than in the gas phase. Therefore, the
              absorption and photolysis of nitric acid adsorbed onto a cold surface will be
              studied. 3) A concept for the direct measurement of the chemical lifetime of
              atmospheric hydroxyl radical will be developed via modeling. An excimer laser
              would photolyze enough ozone to produce hydroxyl radicals at a concentration
              about 100 times more than the typical ambient level. A probe laser would
              monitor the hydroxyl concentration in the time following the photolysis pulse.
              The modeling study will investigate the ability of this approach to furnish the
              true chemical lifetime, and will establish the photochemical conditions of the
              experiment. 4) The Principal Investigator will participate in missions devoted
              to intercomparison of experimental techniques for measuring trace atmospheric
              species, including ongoing efforts concerned with sulfur dioxide and hydroxyl.
