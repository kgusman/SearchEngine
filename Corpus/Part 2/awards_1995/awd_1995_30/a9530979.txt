Abstract    :
              9530979  LJUNGGREN  This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment for  the research vessel MAURICE EWING, operated by the
              Lamont-Doherty  Earth Observatory of Columbia University and dedicated to use
              in  support of ocean science research.         The Shipboard Scientific Support
              Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the
              proper and safe conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides
              support for such  items as deck equipment including winch systems for the
              deployment  and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment 
              such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the
              location of research sites, communication equipment  including radio
              transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice  and scientific data
              communications and other equipment such as  motorized workboats for
              transporting scientists to and from data  retrieval sites.       The Project
              Director, Paul Ljunggren is fully qualified to direct  this project having had
              considerable experience in overseeing the  acquisition and installation of
              shipboard equipment.    This project will allow the institution to obtain a
              P-Code GPS for  accurate navigation, an integrated communication system to meet
               GMDSS safety requirements, an oily water separator for pollution  control, a
              control unit for ship's air conditioning, a hose crimper  and two computers for
              the engineering spaces.  ***
