Abstract    :
              Abstract  Mungal  CTS-9530957    The PI proposes to provide new experimental
              data on the effects of heat release obtained on well defined co-flowing,
              nonpremixed, turbulent jet flames.  Simultaneous measurements using the
              laser-based techniques of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and Planar Laser
              Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) is proposed.  From these measurements detailed
              information on the instantaneous velocities and therefore the strain rate and
              vorticity fields, the temperature distributions and a conserved scalar and its
              gradients will be obtained as the degree of heat release is varied.  The PI
              intends to use either hydrogen or methane diluted with helium (and possibly
              nitrogen) as the fuel mixture and to vary the heat release by changing the
              proportion of hydrogen/methane in the fuel mixture.  It is expected that fast
              chemistry will prevail for most of the run conditions and Reynolds numbers will
              be varied in the range of 2,000 to in excess of 20,000.    The PI will also
              seek to maintain a close relationship between the experiments and modeling
              requirements.  To this end the PI plans to use Dr. J. E. Broadwell as a
              consultant for the model development and to help guide the direction of the
              experimental program.  The proposed research in addition to describing the
              changes to the flowfield associated with heat release seeks alqo to provide
              modelers with the following information: actual strain rates throughput the
              flame brush, residence times of various fluid elements, scalar dissipation
              rates, entrainment and paths of air, and scale distributions.
