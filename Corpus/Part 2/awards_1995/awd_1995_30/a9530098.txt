              filename="AB30098.DOC"    9530098  Dore  The central objectives of this
              workshop are to consider the value of   forests to human society, and to
              investigate methods for managing forest   resources under the different
              valuations that are thereby assigned.  This   workshop will produce a Phase II
              Start-Up Grant proposal to the   Inter-American Institute for Global Change
              Research (IAI) that will   consider the ecology of forests, their role in the
              formation and change of   the global climate, how human activities influence
              forests, what social   value might be assigned to forests, and what policy
              changes would be   necessary to manage the forests as a 'sustainable' resource.
               The Phase II proposal will suggest the construction of a dynamic  
              optimization model for forest management that incorporates the concept of  
              forests as social capital assets.  Many models either have ignored social  
              benefits as intangibles, or have simply considered the forest's stumpage   and
              amenity values.  Remaining stock is often considered as providing no   benefits
              or as not being an asset (essentially, these models consider   forest resources
              to be infinite, because within the models, human activity   does not affect the
              remaining forest's value).  In addition, most models   simply assume that the
              only decision to be made is how much to cut.  This   model will attempt to
              assign an opportunity cost to the cutting.  By   including these ecological and
              social costs, the model will hopefully lead   to a better informed decision on
              when to cut, how much to  cut, and when to   stop cutting.  The workshop will
              use a large set of existing data on boreal forests in   Canada and the United
              States, including those from the BOREAS program, to   determine some of the
              valuations described above.  The Phase II proposal   will attempt validation
              exercises, and try to determine the valuations in   the context of Costa Rican
              and Brazilian forests.  This proposal assembles a team of scientists from the
              following countries:   Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, and the United States. 
              These countries are   Member States of the IAI, an initiative to stimulate
              cooperative research   on global change issues among the scientific
              institutions of the Americas.   The National Science Foundation is the
              designated U.S. Government agency to   carry out the United States'
              responsibilities within the IAI.  %%%  This workshop will consider the value of
              forests to human society, and   investigate methods for better management of
              forest resources.  This   workshop will produce a Phase II Start-Up Grant
              proposal to the   Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI)
              that will   consider the ecology of forests, their role in the formation and
              change of   the global climate, how human activities influence forests, what
              social   value might be assigned to forests, and what policy changes would be  
              necessary to manage the forests as a 'sustainable' resource.  The Phase II
              proposal will suggest the construction of a model for forest   management that
              incorporates the concept of forests as capital assets which   provide certain
              benefits to society.  Many models either have ignored   social benefits as
              intangibles, or have simply considered the forest's   amenity value.  Remaining
              stock is often considered as providing no   benefits or as not being an asset. 
              In addition, most models simply assume   that the only decision to be made is
              'how much to cut.'  This model will   attempt to assign an cost to the cutting,
              because the reduced amount of   forest produces a reduced amount o f benefit -
              less recreational space, less   carbon absorbed, higher evaporative loss of
              fresh water, greater   contamination of reservoirs, etc.  By including these
              ecological and social   costs, the model will hopefully lead to a better
              informed decision on when   to cut, how much to cut, and when to stop cutting.
