Abstract    :
                      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines a new
              material, indium-thallium-phosphide (InTlP), which has been suggested as an
              alternative to mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe) for long wavelength infrared
              (8 to 12 micrometers) detectors for infrared focal plane arrays applications.
              Theoretical calculations suggest that addition of Tl to InP can reduce the
              bandgap of InP from 1.35 eV (0.9  micrometers) to less than 0 to 0.1 eV, i.e.,
              around 8 to 12 micrometers. Though these theoretical predictions have yet to be
              verified (since InTlP has not been made by any growth technique), preliminary
              results for InTlSb have demonstrated that InTlSb films can be grown by
              metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and that addition of Tl to InSb
              can reduce the bandgap to 0.15 eV (8 micrometers). InTIP is expected to have
              properties superior to InTlSb, including complete solid solubility over the
              entire alloy phase diagram, a near lattice-match to InP, and the potential for
              integration of detector arrays and InP read-out circuitry. Further, InTlP
              offers many potential advantages over HgCdTe and III-V quantum well infrared
              photo-detectors (QWIPs); it has higher mechanical strength, lower substrate
              cost, and better compositional uniformity than HgCdTe. In comparison to QWlPs,
              it offers normal incidence detection and higher quantum efficiency.   The
              objective of Phase I is to demonstrate InTlP photoconductive detectors
              operating at two different wavelengths beyond 2 micrometers(less than .5 eV). 
              High performance detectors based on Tl-based alloys will provide a low-cost
              replacement for HgCdTe infrared focal plane arrays. In addition to yielding a
              new class of more economical IR detectors, this material system can be useful 
              for lasers operating in the mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) and long-wavelength
              infrared (LWIR) regions, and for industrial and biomedical thermography.
