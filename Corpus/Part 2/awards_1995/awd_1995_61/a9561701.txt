Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              develop via displacement reactions a novel composite for use in high-speed
              cutting tools.  The ability to increase machining speeds as well as metal
              removal rates will lead to increased productivity at reduced manufacturing
              cost.  A new composite cutting tool insert, made of SiC whisker-reinforced
              alumina (Al203-SiCw), has resulted in a breakthrough for machining nickel
              alloys to speeds of 15 m/s and feed rates up to 0.5 mm/rev.  Dramatically
              improved ceramic composite cutting tool inserts are possible through
              optimization of the ceramic matrix for thermal conductivity, hardness,
              coefficient of friction, toughness, and strength, coupled with a new whisker
              that enhances these properties though chemically inert.  The new optimized
              ceramic composite will also expand the range of metal alloys, including cast
              iron, that can be machined at increased speeds and feed rates, which will also
              result in increased manufacturing productivity at reduced cost.       A new
              class of in situ composites with high strength and fracture toughness and low
              production costs open up many new markets where advanced ceramics are not as
              yet cost effective.  Potential commercial applications include cutting tool
              inserts for machining nickel, iron, and other alloys; heat exchangers; pump
              seals; abrasive jet nozzles; wear plates; and engine components e.g., cam
              followers, brakes, etc.
