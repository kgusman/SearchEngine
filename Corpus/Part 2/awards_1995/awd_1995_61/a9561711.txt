Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at an
              important issue in environmentally conscious manufacturing - design for
              disassembly (DFD).  In a product's disassembly stage, parts are separated and
              sorted based on their environmental characteristics, or the ability to reuse,
              recycle, treat, or dispose of them.  Successful product reuse or recycling can
              be achieved with the appropriate disassembly analysis methodology and software
              tools.  This Phase I will formulate an economical disassembly model in a
              realistic manner based on a detailed understanding of the disassembly process
              and its cost drivers.  An efficient and effective solution procedure will then
              be sought to solve the model.  Finally, a Windows-based software environment
              will be developed to implement the methodology.  Results of the disassembly
              analysis will include the following information for an assembly design: the
              optimum disassembly sequence; the terminating disassembly point (part) in the
              sequence; and the maximum net profit.       As no commercial design for
              disassembly systems are on the market, the potential applications of the
              proposed project are promising.  Based on the results and observations of this
              research, commercial DFD software systems will be developed for product reuse
              and recycling analysis.  Ultimate, a commercial decision support system will be
              developed for environmentally conscious manufacturing.
