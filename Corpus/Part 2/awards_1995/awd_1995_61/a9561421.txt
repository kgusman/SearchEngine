Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply
              silicon optical bench technology to manufacture lasers which are low-cost and
              ultra-compact.  Diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) lasers have yet to achieve
              mass-market penetration because of costs associated with current manufacturing
              techniques and laser designs.  This Phase I addresses the fundamental laser
              design necessary to allow batch processing and miniaturization.         The
              research will: demonstrate a miniaturized single frequency diode laser in a
              novel configuration; demonstrate frequency-doubling of this laser into the blue
              using passive optical locking;and demonstrate use of silicon optical bench
              technology for mounting components used in these lasers.  The work will involve
              implementing frequency control of a laser diode using a miniaturized Fox-Smith
              interferometer.  Cavity components will be designed, fabricated, assembled; and
              the laser performance will be characterized.  This laser will be
              frequency-doubled into the blue using a small potassium niobate insert in the
              cavity.  In parallel, design and processing of silicon wafers for mounting will
              be investigated using photolithography and anisotropic etching.       Low-cost
              blue lasers will find important applications in the consumer optical data
              storage market.  WDM communications and cable TV represent large markets for
              1.3 micron lasers.  Green versions will replace inefficient helium-neon lasers
              in laser pointers and other applications.  Lower volume markets exist in
              printed circuit board inspection, instrumentation, and materials processing.
