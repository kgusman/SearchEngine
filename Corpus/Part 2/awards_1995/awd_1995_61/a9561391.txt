Abstract    :
              95-61391  Girone  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              demonstrate the technical and economic merit of a recently invented and
              patented self-cleaning filter.  The novel device permits localized sequential
              backwashing of a filter element in a continuously operating filter.  The result
              is a filter with extremely long run times, very low maintenance requirements,
              and a clear potential for substantial cost savings.  A wide variety of
              conventional filter media can be employed thus enabling a broad range of
              possible commercial applications.  The idea appears especially promising for
              filtration and separation systems that recover product from a process effluent
              stream as well as for those that require a final polishing stage beyond a
              conventional solids separation process.  In both these cases, ultimate disposal
              of the backwash stream is not required and there is a strong potential for
              significant pollution prevention.  The conceptual design has been completed and
              some encouraging preliminary test results have been obtained using an early
              prototype.  The research objectives are therefore to design and build the
              second generation prototype, conduct filtration and backwash performance tests,
              further delineate the range of potential commercial applications, and begin to
              assemble a computer-based performance and cost model to facilitate process
              optimization.  The initial market focus is to provide final effluent polishing
              filters for wastewater treatment facilities  The way this filter works,
              however, has very important implications for the future:  The backwash flow
              generated is returned to the head of works eliminating the need for additional
              residuals treatment.  Thus, as solids and bacterial discharge standards to
              rivers, lakes, estuaries, and oceans become more stringent, this filter could
              be used to substantially improve the final effluent quality without any major
              upgrade to the treatment plant.
