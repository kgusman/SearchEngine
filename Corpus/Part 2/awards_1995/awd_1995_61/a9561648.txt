Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at the
              development of a network of miniaturized, intelligent, addressable sensing
              modules (ASM's), that can be embedded within a composite structure, remotely
              powered, and interrogated by a personal computer through a non-contacting
              inductive link.  The inductive power link is also used for bi-directional
              communications.  A computer based interrogation system will transmit a data
              request to a specific ASM on the embedded network.  This data request will be
              encoded by frequency shift keying the AC waveform that delivers power to
              embedded electronics.  Once addressed, the embedded ASM will power up its
              strain sensing elements, and data conversion components.  The strain data will
              be sampled and encoded as pulse code modulated (PCM) data.  The PCM serial data
              then modulates an RF carrier for transmission out of the embedded material,
              back to the interrogating computer.  The system will be designed to allow a
              variety of sensing devices to be used interchangeably on the network, this will
              allow smart structures sensing means to be tailored for a specific application.
               Development of the system will be accompanied by thorough testing along the
              way to insure target specifications will be met.       Structures with a broad
              variety of capabilities may be developed by embedding intelligent sensing
              networks of temperature, strain, crack propagation, pressure, magnetic fields,
              etc.  Applications include health monitoring of thick composite structures,
              bridges, dams, and buildings.  Military and commercial potential for these
              systems is significant.
