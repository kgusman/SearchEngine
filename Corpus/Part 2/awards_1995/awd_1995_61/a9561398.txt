Abstract    :
                       This SBIR Phase project will develop the first turn-key, self-shielded
              accelerator-based intense positron beam source for use in research and
              industrial laboratories. Positron beams are powerful diagnostic probes for the
              nondestructive evaluation of metals, semiconductors, and polymers as well as
              for fundamental investigations of materials structure. A major impediment to
              the further development and use of positron-based diagnostics is the present
              lack of suitable sources of intense (> 107 e+/sec) slow positron beams.
              Presently-available radioisotope or electron LINAC sources are much too large
              and expensive for use in a laboratory or industrial environment.   The proposed
              source is based on a new approach to the generation of intense slow positron
              beams: the production of the short-lived (+-emitter 13N via the light ion
              reaction 12C(d,n)13N. A compact, low energy deuteron accelerator with a
              specially-designed target and tungsten moderator will provide slow positron
              fluxes of greater than 107 e+/sec. A field assisted moderator which has the
              potential for providing >108 e+/sec will also be investigated. The proposed
              Phase I study will determine the maximum positron beam intensity which is
              feasible with this source.   The initial market for the  3N-based intense slow
              positron source will be university and industrial laboratories in the U.S. and
              abroad which are already using positron beams. The availability of the proposed
              source will facilitate the more widespread use of positron-based diagnostic
              techniques for semiconductors and metals. If these techniques come into routine
              use, the customer base for a diagnostic instrument based on this source may
              include the majority of semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
