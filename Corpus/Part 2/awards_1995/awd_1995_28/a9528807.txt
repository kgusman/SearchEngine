Abstract    :
              9528807  Gordon         The proposed project is part of a multi-institutional 
              integrated study of the outflow of newly formed bottom water from  the Weddell
              Sea and its dispersion into the South Atlantic Ocean.  It builds upon earlier
              successful studies of the inflow of  intermediate water masses into the Eastern
              Weddell Sea, their  modification within the Weddell Gyre, and their interaction
              with  bottom water formation processes in the western Weddell Sea.  The  study
              is called Deep Ocean Ventilation Through Antarctic  Intermediate Layers
              (DOVETAIL) and includes six components  involving hydrographic measurements,
              natural tracer experiments,  and modeling studies.  The study will be centered
              east of the  Drake Passage where water masses from the Weddell Sea and the 
              Scotia Sea come together in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, and  will be carried
              out in cooperation with the national antarctic  programs of Germany and Spain. 
              This particular component  concerns observations of the temperature and
              salinity structure,  as well as the chemical nature of the water column in the 
              confluence region.       The study has four related objectives.  The first is
              to  assess the quantity and the physical and chemical characteristics  of 
              Weddell Sea source waters for the confluence.  The second is  to describe the
              dominant processes associated with spreading and  sinking of dense antarctic
              waters within the Weddell-Scotia  Confluence.  The third is to estimate the
              ventilation rate of the  world ocean, and the fourth is to estimate seasonal
              fluctuations  in the regional ocean transport and hydrographic structure and to
               assess the likely influence of seasonal to interannual  variability on rates
              of ventilation by Weddell Sea waters.       Ventilation of the deep ocean --
              the rising of sub-surface  water masses to the surface to be recharged with
              atmospheric  gases and to give up heat to the atmosphere -- is a uniquely 
              antarctic phenomenon that has significant consequences for global  change by
              affecting the g lobal reservoir of carbon dioxide, and  by modulating the
              amount and extent of seasonal sea ice in the  southern hemisphere.       This
              component will make systematic observations of the  temperature salinity
              structure of the water and undertake an  extensive sampling program for other
              chemical studies.  The  purpose is to identify the individual water masses and
              to relate  their temperature and salinity characteristics to the  modification
              processes within the Weddell Sea.  ***
