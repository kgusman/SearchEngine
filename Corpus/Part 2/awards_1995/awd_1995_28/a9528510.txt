Abstract    :
              9528510  Warwick  The biogeochemistry of mercury is important because of the
              toxicity of methylmercury, its accumulation in biota, and its biomagnification
              in food chains.  A knowledge of the concentration, transport, and dynamics of
              methylmercury is needed to predict its potential impact on human and aquatic
              life.  The proposed program combines biogeochemical, microbiological, and
              molecular investigations of the formation and degradation of methylmercury with
              certain abiotic factors, and a robust modeling effort, to depict factors
              controlling methylmercury dynamics in the Carson River/Lahontan Reservoir
              System in Nevada.  The Carson System received 7000 tons of elemental mercury
              during the 19th century for gold amalgamation, and now provides a strong
              gradient in mercury concentrations.  Specific goals are to:  1) locate sources
              and sinks of methylmercury; 2) examine bacterial processes including genetic
              controls and the role of terminal decomposition; 3) investigate the
              relationship between the sulfur and mercury cycles, and 4) develop simulation
              models.  The project will consist of two major overlapping activities.  First,
              surveys of :  1) rates of mercury transformation; 2) expression of bacterial
              genes incurring mercury resistance; 3) rates of model will be developed and
              validated, and used to fine tune future sampling programs.  Second, the program
              will address hypotheses encompassing:  1) interactions among mercury
              concentration and speciation; 2) the role of bacteria as producers and
              consumers of methylmercury; 3) changes in genetics and methylmercury
              concentrations; 4) the role of suspended particles, and;  5) fluxes of
              methylmercury from sediments.  The simulation model will be refined using
              biogeochemical data and used for predictive purposes.  The project will provide
              data essential for determining controls on the accumulation of methylmercury in
              fish and other higher forms of life in semi-arid ecosystems, and will be useful
              for comparison to wet and northern environments.  In general , the research
              will distinguish aspects of aquatic systems that most influence the production,
              degradation, and transport of methylmercury, one of the Earth's most insidious
              pollutants.
