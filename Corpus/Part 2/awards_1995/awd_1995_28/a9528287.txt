Abstract    :
              Sassen/Abstract           The object of this research is to utilize the unique, 
              climatologically representative Facility for Atmospheric Remote  Sensing (FARS)
              cirrus cloud dataset, collected over the past 10-y  in support of Project FIRE,
              combined with a focused program of  additional state-of-the-art remote sensor
              cloud case studies, to  prepare a series of publications on the synoptic,
              physical,  microphysical, and radiative properties of high clouds at our 
              midlatitude location.  As of this time, over 2,100-h of FARS ruby  (0.693)
              lidar data have been collected, while more recently-  acquired research
              capabilities including scanning dual-wavelength  (PDL, 1.06 and 0.532)
              polarization lidar, 95 GHz polarimetric  Doppler radar, cologned midinfrared
              radiometer, all-sky imagery,  and a suite of hemispherical and solar tracking
              radiometers.  The  advanced new multiple remote sensor datasets will also aid
              in  student and staff training, and in the evaluation of the prospects  of
              95GHz radar for cloud research.  Among the topics in our  analysis program are;
               statistical studies of the monthly-averaged  heights, temperatures, and
              visible/infrared radiative properties of  cirrus;  their synoptic causes,
              structures from the cloud-to-  mesoscales, inferred contents from lidar linear
              depolarizations  ratios, and an illustrated cirrus cloud atlas;  and, finally,
              the  local (Great Basin) peculiarlarities of contrails, anvils, cirrus  optical
              phenomenon, deep cirrus/altostratus, and supercooled liquid  water in high and
              middle level clouds.
