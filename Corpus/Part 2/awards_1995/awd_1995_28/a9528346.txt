              Host/Parasite Dynamics between Red-  winged Blackbirds and Brown-headed 
              Cowbirds    PI: Jeffrey R. Baylis  Co-PI: Ethan D. Clotfelter    This study
              will examine the effects of brood parasitism by  brown-headed cowbirds
              (Molothrus ater) on the reproductive  success of red-winged blackbirds
              (Agelaius phoeniceus) and  evaluate the importance of this selective pressure
              in  modifying host behavior.  Fieldwork will be conducted during  March-July of
              1996 and 1997 on a prairie-nesting population  of red-winged blackbirds in Rock
              County, Wisconsin.  This  study has four aims.  (1) Redwing nest defense effort
              will  be measured using mounted female cowbirds presented at 3  distances from
              the nest.  Vigilance by male redwings will  also be related to the probability
              of parasitism.  These  data will be used to assess the extent to which redwing 
              behavior has evolved as a response to cowbird parasitism.  (2) The effect of
              cowbird egg-removal on redwing  reproductive success will also be examined by
              combining  clutch manipulations with experimental parasitism.  (3)  Redwing
              parental investment will be compared between  parasitized (exposed to cowbird
              mount) and unparasitized  (not exposed to cowb ird mount) nests.  (4) Empirical
               estimates of redwing quality will be measured in the field  and compared
              between parasitized and unparasitized nests,  and data from 1983-1997 nest
              records will be used to  determine if parasitized nests have intrinsically
              higher  success rates than unparasitized nests. Nest success of  naturally- and
              experimentally-parasitized nests will be  compared to further test this host
              quality hypothesis.  Results from this study will be widely applicable to other
               avian host/parasite systems, including sensitive species  where experimental
              manipulation is impractical or  impossible.  By studying the dynamics of this
              relationship  between closely-related species we can gain greater insight  into
              the evolution of obliga te interspecific brood  parasitism.
