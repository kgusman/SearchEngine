Abstract    :
              9528885  Grindlay       A high-resolution bathymetric and geophysical
              investigation  of a 2,000 km-long portion of the ultra-slow spreading Southwest
               Indian Ridge will be conducted.  The investigation is designed to  establish
              the characteristic morphologic, gravimetric and  magnetic segmentation of the
              straight portion of the ridge from  15 east to 25 east and then study how this
              character changes in  the fracture zone complex between 25 east and 35 east.
