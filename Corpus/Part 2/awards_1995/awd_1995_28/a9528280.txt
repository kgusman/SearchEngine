              Abstract  ATM-9528280  Colinvaux, Paul A.  Smithsonian Institution  Title: The
              Climatic and Environmental History of the Amazon Basin         Since the Last
              Glacial Maximum    This award will contribute to the reconstruction of the
              vegetation  and climate history of the Amazon Basin at the last glacial maximum
               using.  The project will focus on core-drilling and pollen analysis  of the
              sediments of ancient Amazonian lakes.  A climatic history of  the Amazon (an
              area roughly as large as the continental U.S.) is  necessary for calibrating
              global climate models.  Changes in three  climate parameters in ice-age time
              are likely: CO2, temperature, and  precipitation.  Research to date has
              developed ice-age temperature  records at six sites in the tropical Americans. 
              Pollen evidence  shows changes in the range of temperature-sensitive plants 
              suggesting cooling by 6oC.  This cooling suggests also that tropical 
              rainforest occupied the lowlands of the Amazon basin in glacial  times, where
              the effects of cooling should have been least.  Pollen  from a drill core
              through the Amazon fan also suggests that dry  vegetation was no more prevalent
              in the ice-age than it is today.   The goal of the present project is to test
              these conclusions with  cores from ancient lakes in the Amazon `asin.  The
              prime method of  paleoclimate and paleoecological reconstruction will be pollen
               analysis, calibrated by a program of surface pollen sampling.  This  work will
              allow reliable general conclusions both about the ice-age  climate and the
              recent history of the world's most diverse forest.
