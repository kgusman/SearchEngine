Abstract    :
              9525771  Marx    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for six  U.S. scientists to participate in an  international symposium
              on statistics  in agriculture and  the environment, to be held in Santa Marta,
              Colombia, in  June, 1995.   Organizers are Dr. David R. Marx, University  of
              Nebraska, Lincoln, and  Dr. Jorge Martinez, Universidad  Nacional de Colombia,
              Bogota.   This is a joint meeting of  three organizations: the Colombian
              National University, the  International Biometric Society for the Caribbean,
              Central  America, Colombia and Venezuela, and the Interamerican  Statistical
              Institute, with headquarters in Panama City,  Panama.   The conference's
              objectives will be to bring  together statisticians and biologists  from the
              Caribbean,  Central America, Colombia and Venezuela  to promote  scientific
              exchanges,  delimit common research areas, and to  stimulate relationships
              between universities and research  institutions in Latin America.   
              Applications of statistics to censuses and social sciences  are commonly used
              throughout Latin America.  Biometrical and  environmental applications are less
              well known.   The  existing serious environmental problems in the region call 
              for such applications and require well-designed  studies.  It is important for
              statisticians and mathematicians to work  jointly with biologists in developing
              statistical techniques  to solve these serious problems.  This meeting is
              designed  to bring these various groups together.      ***
