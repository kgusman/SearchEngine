Abstract    :
              Abstract - Huang - 9525127    The manufacturing of precious metal products
              usually involves electroplating.  There are over 3,000 electroplating plants in
              the U.S. which utilize more than 100 chemicals to electroplate parts with any
              one or a combination of over 100 different metal coatings.  This has given rise
              to the generation of large volumes of waste streams.  Techniques for waste
              minimization (WM) have been developed, but they have not permeated the plants,
              partly because they have not been well classified and compared in terms of cost
              and efficiency.  Also, implementation of these methodologies and techniques
              requires various kinds of experience in order to achieve not only WM
              efficiency, but also the lowest cost and the highest productivity.    The PIs
              plan to use artificial intelligence techniques to realize comprehensive WM.  A
              knowledge base for source reduction, in-process recycling, and source waste
              (pre)treatment will be developed.  Two decision making algorithms are planned
              for optimizing the use of both first-principles and heuristic knowledge
              residing in the knowledge base.  The ultimate goal of this project is to
              develop an intelligent decision support system for WM in the plating plants of
              any size.  The system will perform at an expert level and will be a tool with
              which the plating industry can improve WM practice with the lowest possible
              cost.  It is expected that the source reduction part of the system will help
              electroplaters evaluate current WM levels and identify new opportunities for
              further waste reduction in various types of plating processes.  The source
              wastewater treatment (with in-process recycling) part of the system will
              provide decisions on selecting the most efficient and cost-effective (pre)
              treatment processes.  Reductions of about 10 percent of wastewater and sludges
              will be targeted.  This system is expected to be initially tested by 50
              selected plants over the project period, and eventually to be introduced into
              the plating industry, with arrangements by  the AESF Society and technical help
              from Hughes Research Laboratories.
