Abstract    :
              BOWERS  9515480  This study draws upon the empirical research about judicial
              behavior and criminal courts, and the distinctive legal, normative, and
              situational context of capital cases, to examine how the decisions, rulings,
              and interpretive practices of trial judges are affected by their backgrounds,
              values, and role orientations, the courthouse and community settings of their
              work, and their response to distinctive features of capital cases, such as
              their perception of the likelihood of federal habeas reversal, state statutory
              sentencing provisions, the implications of death as punishment, the effects of
              heightened publicity, and the capital case experience and perspectives of other
              judges. By examining how trial judges discharge their constitutional
              responsibility in capital cases, this study will seek to contribute to the
              development of an empirically grounded understanding of trial judging.  It uses
              a case-focused interviews with a sample of 60 trial judges who have presided
              over a full capital trial within a year of the interview to (a) describe the
              actions and interpretive practices of capital trial judges and the rationales
              they give for their decisions, (b) assess legal and normative influences on
              uniformity of practice among capital trial judges, and (c) assess individual
              and contextual sources of variation in capital trial judging by judge, by court
              and by case characteristics.  %%%%  This study draws upon the empirical
