Abstract    :
              This project examines a series of political ideas that bear on science:  the
              political meaning of the neutrality claim in science; the nature of
              decision-making and discretion with respect to science;  the problem of
              meaningful discussion, especially in relation to democratic procedures; the
              nature of scientists' actions as representatives of science to other scientists
              and to external audiences; and the problem of agency, which is in part the
              problem of assuring the funders of science that what they are funding is
              valuable.  Agency relationships involve persons acting as agents for others,
              where the special knowledge and conduct of the agent cannot be readily judged
              by the buyer of the services.  The research will identify and compare
              historical alternatives with respect to the delegation of decision-making
              power, and the general constraints on the political organization of science and
              its relation to users, particularly the state.  Sources of authority and
              constraint, under the headings of neutrality, agency, and representation, will
              be examined  The overall goal is to identify the political means by which
              science constructs a domain within which these claims are recognized as
              legitimate.  This award supports the aspect of that research focused on the
              problem of agency in relationship to neutrality and representation, that is to
              say the contract between science and society, including the problem of the
              justification of a state role in science and the implications of this
              relationship for the internal organization of science and the self discipline
              of science.  The project is directed at the production of a major book that
              will update the political theory of science in the light of later criticisms of
              science and the literature of science and technology studies, recent work in
              the history of science, and current changes in the political atmosphere for
              science.
