Abstract    :
                  9515471  Hawley      This award supports the participation of ten American 
              astronomers at a workshop entitled "Accretion Phenomena and   Associated
              Outflows" to be held at Port Douglas, Queensland,  Australia, July 15 through
              19, 1996.  The American organizer is   Prof. John Hawley from the Astronomy
              Department of the University  of Virginia.  The Australian principal organizer
              is  Dr. Lilia Ferrario of the Astrophysical Theory Center of the  Australian
              National University.    The subject of the workshop is accretion disk systems. 
              These  systems are found in such diverse locations as protostellar  systems,
              binary systems containing black holes, white dwarfs or  neutron stars, and the
              centers of active galaxies.  The workshop  brings together researchers
              conducting observations and  theoretical calculations pertaining to basic
              physical mechanisms   involving these diverse systems.  The workshop provides
              the  Australian investigators the opportunity to interact with top  American
              and a few third country astrophysicists, while  acquainting the American
              participants with recent observational  and theoretical research in Australia. 
              It is anticipated that  considerable new collaborative investigations will
              emanate from  this workshop in the area of magnetohydrodynamical and fluid 
              dynamical codes which find application to modelling the physics  of accretion
              disks, jets and winds.    Astrophysics is one of the major fundamental sciences
              supported  by the Australian government.  The Australian support for the 
              workshop is primarily provided by the Australian Department of  Industry,
              Science and Technology (DIST).  The proceedings of the   workshop will be
              published by through the Astronomical Society of  the Pacific.
