Abstract    :
              This research consists of two related projects.  The first is a  theoretical and
              empirical investigation of the connection between  investment flow, employment
              growth, and productivity growth at  the plant level, as well as the consequent
              aggregate  implications.  This research will include the development of 
              theoretical models and an empirical evaluation of the resulting  propositions
              using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD).   Important issues to be
              investigated include: the relevance of  non-convexities in the capital and
              labor adjustment process, the  connection between these factor flows and
              productivity growth and  associated aggregate i  implications.  The second
              topic analyzes financial markets and  the flow of inputs across plant sits. 
              The theme here is that the  financial markets facilitate the flow of capital
              across  production units due to differences in productivity at the  various
              sites. Theoretical models stressing the implications of  plant and sector
              specific shocks will be analyzed under  alternative assumptions about the
              structure of factor and  financial markets.  The LRD will then be used to
              evaluate  implications of the models developed under these alternative 
              hypotheses.
