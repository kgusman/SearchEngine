Abstract    :
              9515005  Stafford  The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal
              study of a representative sample of U.S. individuals (men, women, and children)
              and the family units in which they reside.  It emphasizes the dynamic aspects
              of economic and demographic behavior, but its content is broad, including
              sociological and psychological measures.  As of 1995, the PSID had collected
              information about more than 40,000 individuals spanning as much as 28 years of
              their lives. In the last five years, the PSID added enormously to the stock of
              knowledge about important areas such as health and wealth; added detailed
              information on the residential areas in which respondents live, on mortality,
              and on relationships among family members; and increased the accessibility of
              the data to users.  The purpose of this grant is to transform this unique and
              premier social science data resource into a "steady state" panel representing
              the full U.S. population in perpetuity.  A steady state panel is one designed
              to be self-regenerating, and so will greatly facilitate the study of the
              evolving income, assets, and well-being of American families over their
              life-cycle and, intergenerationally, that of their children.  The PSID will
              also through supplements collect information that will increase its use in the
              future for:   intergenerational studies;   savings, technology and capital
              formation;  health and aging; child development; and  immigration.    Most data
              panels are what can be called "transient" panels.  A particular population is
              identified. An initial sample is drawn and an initial set of measurements
              collected, possibly including retrospective histories.  The sample is followed
              for some specified or even indefinite length of time, so long as attrition, in
              combination with recontact efforts, and mortality permit.  The panel is
              transient in that no plans are made to add new members of the same population
              at a future time.  A steady-state panel has some mechanism or mechanisms
              designed to regenerate samples o f the same (or related) population at a later
              point in time.  In the PSID, built-in mechanisms for regeneration include
              adding children born to sample parents as sample members in their own right and
              following splitoffs.  But these mechanisms increased the sample size and the
              cost of the PSID and they do not capture the changes in the character of the
              U.S. population caused by the larger influx of immigrants since the start of
              the PSID in 1968.  The PSID will be transformed into a "steady state" panel
              that would remain about the same size, attain and maintain long-term national
              representation (inclusive of new entrants), and prove less costly to run
              through the following changes:  1.  Add a refresher sample of post-1968
              immigrants to ensure that the PSID is representative of U.S. households in
              1997.  The immigrants would be added in proportion to their approximate
              representation in the U.S. population that year.  Based upon the 1997 core
              sample size, this means adding about 750 immigrant households.  2.  Delete the
              nonsample respondents currently followed (about 122), and extreme low weight
              cases (about 200).  3.  Identify a longer periodicity group of 2,939 original
              1968 families and related recontacts to suspend in 1997 and interview in 1999
              with non-NSF funding.  4.  Interview the remaining 5,929 core sample families,
              plus 750 immigrants and 300 recontracts, and their splitoffs, every other year,
              that is, in 3 of the 5 years: 1997, 1999, and 2001.  5.  Conduct additional
              recontact efforts and follow the successful recontacted respondents so as to
              balance attrition in each of the survey years.  6.  Continue Internet
              development for timely user access to the data.  ??
