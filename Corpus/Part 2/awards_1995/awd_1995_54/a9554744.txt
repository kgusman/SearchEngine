Abstract    :
              (The Problem)  Few opportunities to learn new methods of physics  instruction
              exist for physics faculty who teach in  technical/community colleges in the
              northern New England state of  Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont due to limited
              funds to pay for  travel and registration at national and, in man cases,
              regional  AAPT meetings often held in the southern New England states.  (The 
              Objectives)  This proposal seeks funding for two faculty  enhancement workshops
              to be held during the summers of 1996 and  1997 to provide opportunities for 24
              physics instructors from two-  year and four-year colleges and universities in
              both the northern  and southern New England states to learn ways of presenting
              physics  instruction via the Internet and the World Wide Web.  (Methods to 
              accomplish the objectives)  During the workshops, participants will  learn how
              to create platform-independent physics lessons using the  hypertext markup
              language of browsers such as Netscape which can be  shared with other
              instructors from neighboring New England states.   (Collaborations)  They will
              work with the nationally recognized  leaders in distance education from
              institutions including the USAF  Academy and Indiana University, Purdue
              University Indianapolis who  have developed innovative new ways to teach using
              the World Wide  Web.   (Significance/impact of the project)  The workshop will 
              offer the unique opportunity for physics faculty to discuss during  a two-week
              period critical issues in the teaching of college  physics using distance
              education at the two and four-year level and  to develop a strategic plan to
              promote stronger partnerships  between two-year and four-year colleges through
              the sharing of  information and resources.
