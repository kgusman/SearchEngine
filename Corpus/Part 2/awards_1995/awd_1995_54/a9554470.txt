Abstract    :
              Shacklett  95-54470    The NSF Networking Infrastructure for Education
              Implementation Grant will provide a process  model for integrating a networking
              infrastructure into the Morse High School Center for Tech-  nology and Pacific
              Rim Studies magnet. The infrastructure will support Morse High School's  effort
              to implement reform concepts contained in the master plan for high schools in
              California:  Second to None: A Vision of the New California High School. The
              project centers on the develop-  ment of an interdisciplinary career path
              curriculum supported by multimedia technology. The  goal of the proposed
              educational reform is that every high school graduate will have the knowl- 
              edge and skills needed to make the choice of immediately entering the workforce
              or to continue  in post-secondary education before engaging in a career. The
              project will result in a process model, documented on CD ROM and disseminated
              through the Internet. that can be used by other schools which are integrating
              technology and implementing educational reforms to improve student achievement
              in  math and science.    The project will develop a process model for
              implementing Second to None that includes the following components:     
              development of an interdisciplinary curriculum for five magnet career paths:
              Aeronautics, Engineering, Science, Tourism, and Languages    integration of
              high quality math and science courses in each career path    a Certificate of
              Initial Mastery (CIM) program    a "Tech Prep" certification program    early
              entry to college-level study through telecourses and community college courses
              on and off campus    a collaborative model K-16    a process for delivering
              staff development for teachers and other staff functioning in a Second to None
              teaching and learning environment    a process for involving industry as full
              partners in the Second to None teaching and learning environment    a process
              for integrating a networking infrastructure that will support and enhance
              student learning, staff developmen t, industry and parent/community
              involvement, and administration/ classroom management.    Over the three year
              period, the project will:      network the entire school    train teachers and
              other school personnel in the use of technology    utilize
              school/parent/industry design teams to develop the career path curriculum   
              replicate school/industry/university models providing students hands-on
              experience using technology and on-the-job experiences    infuse math and
              science in each career path    redesign courses using applied, problem-solving
              approaches    integrate technology and accompanying new teaching/learning
              methodologies, including ethics, in the classroom curriculum    develop
              academic support programs using technology for students who fail to meet
              minimum standards in math, science, and reading
