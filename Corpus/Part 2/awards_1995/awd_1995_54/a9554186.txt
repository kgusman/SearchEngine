Abstract    :
                  abstract    ESI 9554186    Patricia Campbell    Institution:  University of
              Maryland at College Park with subcontract to Baltimore City Schools   
              Mathematics:  Application and Reasoning Skills (MARS) is a 4-year Local
              Systemic Change project at $5,999,000 to enhance all of the approximately 2300
              K-5 teachers of mathematics in the Baltimore City Schools.  The enhancement is
              aligned with national standards and the Maryland State Outcomes in Mathematics.
               It is focused on adult-level mathematics content, instructional methods to
              promote student understanding and problem solving, research on children's
              learning  of critical mathematics constructs, mathematics curriculum standards,
              performance assessment, strategies to increase math achievement and preparation
              of urban students, and community resources for continuing mathematics
              education.  Cohorts of schools will participate in two-year enhancement cycles.
               All teachers in a building will receive at least 100 hours of enhancement
              starting with a 14-day summer institute which includes work with students in a
              summer program.  Teachers will be required to complete 15 hours of professional
              development during the first year of implementation and an additional 13 hours
              in the second year of implementation. Three lead teachers, selected from within
              the building, will receive 60 hours of advanced leadership training  and
              support during the year prior to that building faculty's first summer. A cadre
              of exemplary teachers will be released from the classroom for up to six years
              to be prepared and to serve as project resource teachers.  There will be one
              resource teacher for every three schools to act as peer coach, program monitor,
              teacher consultant and give day-to-day support in that school.  Principals will
              participate in quarterly meetings during this period.  MARS establishes faculty
              partnerships across higher education facilities in the City of Baltimore to
              support the co-development of continuing mathematics education courses
              addressing mathematics  content, mathematics pedagogy, and the integration of
              mathematics and science.  There is collaboration with the Baltimore USI
              project.  Cost-sharing is reported at $1,587,819 or 26% of the NSF support.
