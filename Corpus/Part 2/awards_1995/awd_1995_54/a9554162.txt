Abstract    :
                9554162  Tinker    The Concord Consortium and ten collaborators provide a
              unique approach to delivering courses to grade 9-12 teachers through computer
              networking and other technologies.  Collaborators include six USIs (Chicago,
              Columbus, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix), one RSI (American
              Indian Science and Engineering Society), three school districts (in California,
              Massachusetts, Kentucky), and Fermi Lab (Illinois).  They are responsible for
              all local support for the courses.  The project uses innovative delivery
              techniques and new technologies to support asynchronous instruction.  The first
              eighteen months emphasize examining and improving the effectiveness of the
              course delivery, monitoring and structure.  The last half of the project
              expands the scope to include more disciplines as well as a broader range of
              teachers.  Using a combination of on-line instruction, real and "virtual" study
              groups, video, and other techniques, participants receive the equivalent of 125
              contact hours.  The emphasis is on getting teachers involved in extended
              investigations and supporting these with just-in-time assistance in the
              requisite skills and knowledge in core disciplines and educational strategies. 
              Continuing Education Units are available and university graduate credit is
              anticipated.  An impressive list of instructors ensures expertise in
              mathematics and all school science disciplines.  Although beginning with just
              75 participants, 925 are anticipated.  Cost-sharing and other in-kind
              contributions will make the project self-sustaining at less that $900 per
              teacher for approximately 8 credits.  Cost sharing is 9%.          1   1
