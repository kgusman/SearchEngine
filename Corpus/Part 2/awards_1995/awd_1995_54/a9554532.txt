Abstract    :
                9554532  Kamen    U.S. FIRST is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to
              create a demand for science and mathematics learning among today's students. 
              Creating this demand requires a change in attitudes and preconceptions that had
              been turning American students away from technology.  The Robotic Competition
              is one way we are currently accomplishing this goal on a national level.  The
              model for this competition is based on a course at the Massachusetts Institute
              of Technology (MIT) where engineering students are challenged to create a
              product under time contraints in an interclass competition.    The U.S. FIRST
              National Robotic Competition extends this idea by involving partnerships
              between high schools, universities and the corporate engineering world.  In
              seven weeks, teams of engineers, teachers and students work together to design
              and build radio-controlled devices from a standard kit of parts provided by
              U.S. FIRST.  Teams then compete against each other in matches in regional and
              national tournaments.  The machines must be operated by two students,
              accompanied by two coaches -- other students, teachers or engineers.  The
              National Champion is the winner of the national tournament.    By providing
              real-life role models for students and by using the same techniques used by
              large consumer product companies, students become motivated and begin to see
              science as fun, prestigious and professionally rewarding.  ***
