Abstract    :
              Digital signal processors (special-purpose fast microprocessors),  made possible
              through advances in integrated circuits, have added  a new element to the
              environment of digital signal processing  (DSP).  These processors have found
              their way into a number of  applications including communications and controls,
              graphics,  instrumentation, speech, and image processing.  They have emerged 
              as a response to the ever-increasing number of real-time DSP  applications. 
              This workshop will combine both the lecture and  laboratory components of DSP,
              with a special emphasis on the  laboratory component, providing the
              participants valuable hands-on  experiences.  The undergraduate faculty
              participants will implement  a wide range of real-time experiments and
              mini-projects such as a  digital oscillator, finite and infinite impulse
              response filters,  adaptive filters, and the fast Fourier transform.  Available
              tools  and techniques will be provided to the faculty participants who  will
              quickly realize how software and hardware experiences can be  used to motivate
              their senior students.  They would then be able to  integrate these software
              and hardware experiences into senior-level  courses at their home institutions.
