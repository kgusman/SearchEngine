Abstract    :
              9554230  Allen      The Darden College of Education at Old Dominion
              University(ODU), in conjunction  with the Norfolk Public Schools (NPS), will
              develop a proposal for a competitive  Networking Infrastrcture for Education
              project, in support of the Norfolk Public  Schools' PRIME (Public School
              Restructuring for Innovative Mainstream Education)  Project, a long term(10
              year), comprehensive education restructuring initiative.  The  planning grant
              will make it possible to:    Develop a plan to network the six PRIME
              schools(complete building network), with  internet access from each class room;
              homes, schools, and community agencies will  eventually be linked;    Help fund
              release time for teachers and administrators to collaborate in the  development
              of the technology infrastructure plan and its instructional uses, and plan  for
              staff development to accelerate the learning curve for becoming technologically
               exemplary teachers;    Collaborate with members of the national Academy of
              sciences Draft National  Science Education Standards and the National Council
              of Teachers of Math  Guidances in the development of a compressed, contextual,
              math and science  curriculum;    Develop a cadre of involved and committed
              parents at each school, from a cross  section of SES levels, who will be
              involved in planning grant activities, and to plan  school labs with labtop
              lending for parents and community, with school based  computer and
              telecommunications training;    Further seek and develop collaboration with
              industry and business, and strengthen  existing ties and forge new links with
              the U.S. Navy, which has a large presence in  the Norfolk area; develop links
              with social organizations, for example, libraries,  social services, and rest
              home for mutual benefit;    Develop a plan for a full scale test of curriculum
              compression; develop measurable  evaluation criteria for the effects of
              curriculum compression on student achievement  and teacher effectiveness, and
              to measure the effects of parental and community   involvement on student
              achievement.    Teams of teachers, administrators, parents, ODU faculty, NPS
              central office  personnel, and grant staff will meet for three weeks in July
              and August, 1995, and  once each month for seven months, in preparation for
              performing tasks such as:  gathering baseline data on current instructional
              technology practices, hardware and  software configurations, and parental
              levels of technological expertise using surveys;  consulting with members of
              the national standards of learning for math and science  communities, and
              assessment planners; developing business partnerships through  parental
              contacts and intensive direct solicitation; strengthening a partnership with 
              the Brunswick County Public Schools; identifying staff development imperatives,
               technology, curriculum and change management.    A unique, systematic,
              restructuring project located in an economically challenged  area, PRIME is a
              prototype for school reform which may be replicated in any school  district. 
              PRIME, through its emphasis on technology and telecommunications, seeks  to
              completely redefine the process necessary to prepare students, including those 
              most at risk, for leading roles in a technological, multi cultural global
              village.   Technology will not be viewed as an "add on" to sustain the
              traditional curriculum.   The opportunities provided by a technologically rich
              environment will extend to  parents and community to overcome the isolation of
              poverty, create trust between a  cross section of the population, nationally
              and internationally, that would otherwise  remain isolated for each other.
