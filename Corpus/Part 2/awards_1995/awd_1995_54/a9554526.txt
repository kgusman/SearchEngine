Abstract    :
              GER-9554526  King  Traineeships will fund five NCSU  graduate students working
              in  Instructional Technology for  Science Education. Trainees will  enroll in
              either Physics Education  (Physics), Science Education  (Mathematics and
              Science  Education), or Spatial Information  Systems (Forestry) and complete
              new  interdisciplinary seminars focusing  on research n the frontiers of 
              instructional technology in science  education. Internationally  recognized
              faculty from other  departments who have conducted  extensive research on
              electronic  delivery of instruction will also  participate in these seminars as
               well as teach other graduate  courses in instructional  technology. Trainees
              will attend  professional research conferences  and participate in NCSU's
              multiple  regional and national service  activities in science education, 
              including the American Physics  Association's Physics Academic  Software
              Project, housed at NCSU;  the NSF-and industry-funded Science  House, which
              sponsors outreach  projects to rural and African  American K-12 students and
              NC's  science and math teachers; and the  GIS Literacy Project. Traineeships 
              will assist NCSU in focusing its  multiple research programs in the  Colleges
              of Physical and  Mathematical Sciences, Agricultural  and Life Science,
              Engineering,  Education and Psychology,  Humanities and Social Sciences, and 
              the School of Design that are  integrating instructional  technologies with
              cognitive science  to develop truly innovative models  of science education.
