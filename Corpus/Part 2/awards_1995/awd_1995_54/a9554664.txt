Abstract    :
              A three-year project is proposed to train faculty in the  integration of new
              teaching techniques that utilize interactive  methods, personal computers, and
              miltimedia.  Faculty will also be  educated as to the student needs resulting
              from the recent growth  in diversity in the student population.  Thirty
              participants will  be selected from two and four-year colleges within the New
              York  metropolitan area.  These institutions include Long Island  University,
              Kingsborough Community College, St. Francis College,  Pace University, and New
              York City Technical College among others.   Participants will be required to
              submit a plan for dissemination as  a condition for acceptance into the
              project.  The options under  this plan are: present the results of the
              utilization of the  teaching methods learned at the workshops at one of six 
              dissemination seminars conducted during the last two years of the  project;
              present techniques learned from the activities of the  project to faculty at
              the participants' home institutions; mentor  two faculty members at the
              participants' home instititutions in the  teaching techniques learned from the
              project.  The workshops and  dissemination seminars will be subject to
              formative and summative  evaluation procedures.
