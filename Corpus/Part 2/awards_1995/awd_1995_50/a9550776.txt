Abstract    :
              The goals of the proposed program will be to increase the number of  minorities
              entering SMET careers by providing a foundation for  life-long interest in
              science and mathematics for at least 50  participants annually; and, to provide
              activities which encourage  the participants to consider SMET as possible
              career choices.  The  specific objectives are to:  motivate students to remain
              in school  and interest them in studying the sciences and mathematics; to help 
              students understand science and future scientific questions through  hands-on,
              mind-on activities; help students become more self-  reliant in their school
              work while raising their self-esteem;  provide enriching learning experiences
              to improve the qualitative,  quantitative and analytical skills of the
              participants and to show  the importance of science, mathematics, and
              communication skills in  our daily lives; expose students to a board range of
              participatory  activities and to professionals in the area of science, math, 
              engineering and computer science; offer students information and  guidance in
              the career exploration process and the academic  preparation needed for a
              variety of professions, especially  potential math and science careers;
              heighten students' awareness   of science and mathematics disciplines as
              potential career choices,  including science teaching, encourage students
              through science  participation, knowledge and attitude to take prerequisite
              courses  for college majors in science and/or math; and, capture the  attention
              and assistance of more parents by preparing them to  support their children
              through actual involvement of the program's  activities.    The methodology
              will include providing academic enrichment in SMET  during a 5-week Summer
              Science Camp and Academic Year Follow-Up  Activities.  During the summer,
              Classroom and laboratory activities  in mathematics (including algebra),
              science (life and earth),  computer literacy and scientific communications will
              be offered.   Research methodology and career expl oration activities will also
              be  included.  Academic year follow-up activities will include an  extension of
              the summer content/activities on Saturdays and  participation in the South
              Carolina Middle/Elementary School  Academy of Science (SCMESAS) activities.  In
              this effort the  College will join with the middle schools in Richland County
              School  District One to establish SCMESAS clubs in their schools.    The
              desires outcome for the program will be an increase in the  number of
              minorities enrolling in SMET courses in both high school  and college with a
              subsequent increase in both the program  participants and their peers entering
              SMET careers.
