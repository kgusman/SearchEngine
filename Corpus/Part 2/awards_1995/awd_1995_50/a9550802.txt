Abstract    :
                   Given recent advances in network and MUD (Multi-User Domain)  technology,
              it is now possible to build a networked simulation of  the international
              financial system containing within it several  simulated national financial
              systems.  We propose to build that  simulation, and to call it Money MOO.      
                 Few current financial or economic simulations illustrate  interactions
              inside the financial system as a whole.  Fewer still  combine national and
              international financial systems to illustrate  their interconnectedness. 
              Although the economic system itself is  dependent on interactions among
              individuals and institutions,  currently available simulations do not typically
              base their  outcomes on that reality.  Instead, most existing financial 
              simulation software is designed to be used by an individual student  working in
              isolation, not cooperating or interacting with other  students.          Our
              proposed simulation, Money MOO, will have the following  characteristics:      
                  a.   The simulation will be interactive and its outcomes will           
              depend on the combined decisions of the student-players.       b.   The
              simulation will be made freely available to all            educational
              institutions through the Internet.          c.   The simulation will be fun to
              play.  It will be a version            of the most popular networked
              interactive game format            which exists, the Internet MUD.           
              This networked simulation tool will permit courses such as  Introductory
              Macroeconomics, Money and Banking, and Financial  Institutions and Markets to
              be taught much more effectively than  they can be if the only available tools
              are textbooks and  single-user simulations.
