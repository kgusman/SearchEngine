Abstract    :
              Development of the national information infrastructure is a top  priority
              direction by which this country has chosen to drive its  technology to the
              future, innovate its social and economical  interests, and maintain its
              international competitiveness and  technological lead.  At the backbone of this
              information  superhighway lies the breakthrough technology of optical networks.
                This research outlines the relevance of the mathematical techniques  of
              algorithmic graph theory and combinatorial optimization in the  design and
              operations of backbone all-optical networks.  Three  prototype classes of
              problems will be investigated.  The first  class is new and it exemplifies
              minimization of investment cost.   The second class is also new and it
              exemplifies optimization of  service.  The third class exemplifies maximization
              of technological  benefits, and has been previously examined under different
              model  assumptions.  The significance of automation in high speed network 
              studies and relevance of algorithms and optimization in the  manufacturing of
              all-optical devices for all-optical networks will  be outlined.    Interactive
              activites include:  teaching a graduate course on  Approximation Algorithms and
              Applications, teaching an  undergraduate course on Introduction to Algorithms,
              organizing a  workshop on Computational Support for Very High Speed Networking,
               and organizing student field trips to visit laboratories at  Bellcore.
