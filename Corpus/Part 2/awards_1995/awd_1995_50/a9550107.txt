              involvement in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)
              offers significant opportunities to help inform change during this critical
              time.  TIMSS results will test and to advance the theoretical underpinnings of
              systemic reform by providing empirical analyses as well as new methodologies. 
              The request for funding contained in this proposal is for data analysis and
              dissemination activities.  In particular this proposal asks for: 1) continuing
              support for the U.S. National Research Center; 2) the development of an
              analytical strategy for linking the intended curriculum (curriculum analysis)
              to the curriculum implemented by teachers in the classroom and finally to what
              students learn; 3) the analysis of the U.S. TIMSS data and writing of the
              corresponding reports with an eye toward informing current policy initiative
              and reform efforts and 4) public relations and dissemination activities
              designed to make these results available to various constituencies especially
              the general public and business communities.  Two current policy initiatives
              are important to this proposal: (1) t he National Educational Goals and (2)
              content-driven systemic school reform.  This proposal states our purpose to
              perform the work that not only is grounded in the comparative education
              tradition and also will enable the TIMSS data to address central policy
              questions of interest to the United States and disseminate the knowledge gained
              to interested national audiences: policy makers, researchers, educators,
              business and community leaders and parents.                         ;
