Abstract    :
              9550507  Garibaldi    The Model Institutions for Excellence award to Xavier
              University od Louisiana will support the initiation and implementation of
              systemic changes in the University that will result in significant improvements
              in (non-health) Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) student outcomes as
              follows:   o a 98% increase (from 43 to 85) in the number of Xavier students
              graduating in SEM disciplines based on a projected 75% rate of retention;   o a
              quadrupling of the number (from 16 to 64) of Xavier SEM graduates enrolling,
              annually, in graduate and professional schools;   o the development of an
              academic and physical infrastructure that will sustain, with the full
              commitment of the University's administration, the new projected level of
              student outcomes; and   o the establishment and documentation of a successful
              and replicable model for SEM undergraduate student preparation for
              graduate/professional school or professional placement.    To attain these
              goals, major changes will occur in the areas of facilities, curricula, student
              services, and student scholarship assistance. These changes will be coincident
              with and complemented by the commitment of the University to secure funding of
              approximately $7 million to construct a new facility (by the end of 1997) to
              accommodate existing and projected needs of faculty and students in the SEM
              academic areas of interest.    The SEM disciplines of particular interest in
              this project will include Biology (non-premed), Chemistry (non-ppemed),
              Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and the Dual Degree Engineering Program.
                 The development of this project has been accomplished through a process that
              involved extensive and open discussions among most of the senior administrative
              officers of the University including the President, Executive Vice President,
              Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Development, Dean of
              Arts and Sciences, Academic Department Chairs, special Program Directors, and
              other selected faculty and staff. Thi s process of communication and
              cooperation will continue and will be expanded to include the input of the
              corporate and public sectors and representatives from other Universities as
              part of an Advisory Council/Committee.    Evaluation of this project will be an
              on-going activity built on the establishment of baseline data on existing
              student outcomes and assessed against the specific visions, Goals and
              Objectives set forth in the program description. The evaluation process will be
              performed in close collaboration with Technical Assistants identified by the
              National Science Foundation     The project, from the planning stage and
              through its implementation, will be carefully documented to provide the optimum
              opportunity for the formulation of a Model Process and Program that is
              replicable in comparable academic environments around the country.        2
