Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              automated speaker verification (ASV).  Speaker verification is the process of
              determining whether a given voice sample belongs to a particular person. 
              Analog complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) speech-recognition chips are
              presently under development, combining integrated silicon cochleae and neural
              networks based on auditory system modeling.  ASV will expand on this technology
              base.  ASV is a computationally intensive task but can be solved efficiently
              with massively parallel strategies  Phase I will develop an algorithm that uses
              a developed front-end cochlear processor in conjunction with a focused gamma
              neural network (FGNN) and a novel structure called a local receptive field
              gamma neural network.  Each gamma filter will be modified to behave as a
              speaker-matched filter.  Phase II would map an ASV algorithm onto dedicated
              silicon (analog or digital) to realize a reliable, compact, low-cost ASV
              processor.        ASV is useful for low-security access-control systems.  A
              low-cost, compact ASV technology will find applications in existing consumer
              electronics as a component of the human-machine interface.  In the home,
              answering machines, telephone long-distance access, and other low-security
              devices will be protected so that only particular speakers have access;
              specific cable-TV channels will be safeguarded by parental control; and
              speaker-trained toys will be programmed to know their `owner.`  Computers in
              sleep or screen-saver mode could be activated by an authorized voice.  Many
              other potential consumer applications are possible.
