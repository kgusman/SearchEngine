Abstract    :
              9560960  Dixon    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks
              to discover a fundamental new approach to a problem older than Noah; namely,
              how to keep the bottoms of boats free from biofouling in an environmentally
              acceptable manner.  Since Noah first used pitch, man has relied on toxic
              materials to inhibit biofouling.  Unfortunately these materials have tended to
              persist in the marine environment.  Increased use of marine resources by man
              has tended to compound the problem to the point where today selection for use
              from only a very short list of toxicants is permitted, and even choosing
              substances from this list is undesirable.  The objective of this research is to
              demonstrate that the use of persistent toxicants is unnecessary.  Laboratory
              formulation of phototoxic surfaces are proposed as well as tests of their
              resistance to biofouling in the marine environment.  If successful, the
              approach will largely replace coatings which rely on persistent toxicants such
              as copper and organotin compounds.   Bottom paint, which represents a
              multimillion dollar worldwide market, is primarily manufactured and sold by
              foreign firms using technology which is a century old.  Their products are
              solvent based and hazardous to apply and remove.  Paint chips must be collected
              and disposed of as hazardous waste.  Replacing this technology with one that is
              more environmentally acceptable is very desirable and is becoming increasingly
              essential as country after country bans toxicants for antifouling.
