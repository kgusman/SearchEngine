Abstract    :
              9510460  Watson    Colloidal crystals, fabricated from microsphere dielectric 
              particles, can be tailored to satisfy the Bragg condition  for visible and near
              infrared light.  The interaction of  light with the optical lattice results in
              photonic band  structure that is analogous to electronic band structure in 
              atomic crystals.  Spectroscopic and interferometric  determination of photonic
              band structure  will be extended  from the visible to the near infrared.  In
              addition to  continued investigation of photonic band structure in theses 
              crystals and its implications for photon localization, new  initiatives include
              the study of (1) impurity modes in  photonic stop bands and (2) interaction of
              band structure  effects and nonlinear optical properties.  %%%  The
              technological developments of the past 50 years,  initiated with the invention
              of the transistor, were  possible only by the extensive and continued research
              of the  physical properties of semiconductor materials.  Future  photonic
              analogs of today's electronic devices, where light  action replaces that of the
              electron, may sustain these  technological advancements at the current rate. 
              The  behavior of light in photonics crystals wil l be  experimentally studied
              by numerous optical methods in an  attempt to understand the issues of photon
              transport and  localization in future devices, and its relationship to 
              electron transport and localization in current devices.***
