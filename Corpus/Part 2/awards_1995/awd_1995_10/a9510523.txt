Abstract    :
              Speth    Under the direction of Dr. John Speth, Mr. Renato Kipnis will  collect
              data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  archaeological excavation
              at two sites - Grande Abrigo de Santana  do Riacho and Lapa do Boquete - both
              located in eastern Central  Brazil. Primr excavations at both indicate that
              they have  excellent organic preservation, including rich botanical and  animal
              remains, perishable wooden and reed artifacts and human  burials. They have
              several occupation levels that span most of  the last 12,000 years. Through his
              excavation, Mr Kipnis will  increase the samples of floral and faunal remains
              as well as  cultural artifacts such as ceramics and stone tools. Excavation 
              will be specifically aimed at recovering controlled samples which  will permit
              quantitative analysis and intra- and inter-site  comparison. Sediment column
              samples will be collected for pollen  analysis. On this basis it will be
              possible to reconstruct  detailed changes in environment and document human
              response to  these.    The goal of this research is to investigate how human
              societies  at a simple level of cultural and technological organization  adapt
              to severe environmental change. Over the last 12,000 years  such variation has
              occurred in Central Brazil and these two  archaeological sites with excellently
              preserved remains offer Mr.  Kipnis to address this question. Archaeologists
              have posited  different adaptational strategies. One involves resource 
              diversification and intensification where the focus is on change  in local use
              of the environment. Another is primarily social and  involves the establishment
              of networks among groups and the  increased movement of goods and individuals.
              The work which Mr.  Kipnis will conduct should help to determine which of these
               alternatives is most likely.    This research is important for several
              reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed
              new light  on how societies interact with their environment and assist in  the
              training  of a promising young scientist.
