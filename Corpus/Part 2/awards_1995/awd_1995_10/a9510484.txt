Abstract    :
              Dr. Rosemarie Szostak, Chemistry Department, Clark Atlanta University, is  
              supported under a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and   Engineers
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the
              Chemistry Division to incorporate theoretical modeling   into a program in the
              experimental design of  zeolites and zeolite based   catalysts. Dr. Szostak
              will join the Biosym  Catalysis and Sorption   Project, which is a partnership
              developing effective software for the   solution of catalysis and sorption
              problems.  Dr. Szostak will apply the   newly designed methodologies to examine
              faulting in zeolite structures   and to predict organic cations that will
              alleviate faults in zeolites.  Zeolites are widely used industrial materials
              which have numerous   applications including as catalysts, molecular sieves,
              and ion and gas   separation materials. While zeolites have  been studied
              experimentally   for many years, the ability to theoretically predict their
              structures or   properties is only now becoming possible. This Career
              Advancement Award   will permit Dr. Szostak, a well respected zeolite
              experimentalist, to   obtain the skill needed for her to apply theoretical
              tools to the   understanding of these materials. By membership in the Biosym 
              Catalysis   and Sorption Project she will be able to integrate her experimental
                program with the most recent computational techniques.
