Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the 1995 Sigma Xi forum.  The forum
              marks the 50th anniversary of Vannevar Bush's seminal report Science:  The
              Endless Frontier, with an examination of his assumptions about the role of the
              federal government in supporting scientific research.  The aim is to develop an
              updated national mission statement for science in the aftermath of the Cold War
              and to contribute to a guiding national vision for science and technology in
              the decades ahead.  Sigma Xi's extensive network of 500 chapters and clubs,
              with outreach into the academic, industrial, and governmental sectors, provides
              a solid base from which to stimulate this discussion.  The forum's format,
              patterned on previous successful forums, includes speakers, panels, and
              breakout groups over a period of two days.  Speakers include leaders in
              university and industrial research, as well as government and foundation
              officials.  Participants will include scientists and officials from private and
              public sector organizations.  A proceedings volume will include breakout group
              conclusions and recommendations as well as the texts of plenary addresses.
