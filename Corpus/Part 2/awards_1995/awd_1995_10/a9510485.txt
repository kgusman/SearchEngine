Abstract    :
              Dr. Amy Mullin of Boston University is supported by the Experimental   Physical
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division with a Research   Planning Grant to
              study the collisional and reactive dynamics of highly   vibrationally excited
              polyatomic molecules.  These species will be   prepared by ultraviolet laser
              excitation followed by rapid internal   conversion to high vibrational levels
              of the ground electronic state.    Preliminary studies will concentrate on
              energy transfer between   vibrationally excited pyrazine or pyridine with
              carbon dioxide and water.    Product state distributions and absolute cross
              sections will be   measured.  Ultimately, experiments will be conducted to
              investigate the   ability of high levels of internal excitation to drive
              otherwise   unreactive systems over an activation barrier.   Most chemical
              reactions take place on the ground electronic states of the   reactants.  Large
              activation barriers can prevent reactions from taking   place, even when the
              systems are at elevated temperatures.  In this   project, Professor Mullin will
              use laser excitation to populate high   vibrational levels of these molecules,
              corresponding to vibrational   temperatures of 3000K, a temperature which would
              normally decompose the   molecule.   This method of preparation allows a large
              amount of energy to   be present in the reactant without decomposing it and
              enhances the   reaction by providing enough energy to overcome the activation
              barrier.
