              Abstract for ATM-9510170  Warren, Stephen, University of Washington  Title:
              Global Distribution of Diurnal Cycles and Long-term Changes          in Cloud
              Amounts from Surface Observations    Clouds have large effects on the earth's
              radiation budget, both  shortwave and longwave.  These effects are different
              for different  cloud types, and the net forcing usually changes sign from day
              to  night.  A study of how clouds have changed in the past may help to  clarify
              the interactions of clouds with other parts of the climate  system and to infer
              changes in cloud radiative forcing.  For  global-changes studies involving
              clouds, a long period of record  with global coverage and with no change in
              observing procedures is  necessary.  Routine surface weather observations of
              clouds,  beginning about 1952 from ships in the ocean and 1971 from land 
              stations, meet these requirements. Creation of databases and  analyses of those
              databases are proposed to determine the changes  of cloud types and their
              diurnal cycles over the past 40 years.    Surface weather observations from
              land and sea have previously been  used to produce a global climatology of
              total cloud cover type  amounts, covering the 30-year period 1952-1981 over the
              ocean and  the 11-year period 1971-1981 over land.  These results were 
              published in a series of four climatic atlases, which have found  numerous uses
              in climatic research.  Recently an improvement to the  analysis procedure has
              been developed establishing an illuminance  criterion for nighttime
              observations.  By screening nighttime  observations based on the availability
              of sufficient moonlight or  twilight more accurate diurnal cycles of cloud
              amounts can be  obtained.    This illuminance criterion will be used to
              determine the  geographical distribution of cloud type amounts, their diurnal 
              variations, interannual variations, and long-term trends.  The  trends will be
              analyzed separately for day and night, since cloud  radiative forcing is
              generally negative in daytime but positive  at  night.  The research consists
              of the creation of a hierarchy of  three databases for climatic analyses of
              clouds, spanning the 45  years 1952-1996.    (1) Edited Cloud Reports Archive

              Global analysis of the geographical distribution of interannual  variations and
              multi-decadal trends in amounts of the different  cloud types (1954-1996 for
              ocean; 1971-1996 for land).    This work is important because cloud processes
              are among the most  important in climate change and long-term data about clouds
              are  essential to an improved understanding of cloud processes.    This project
              is co-funded by NSF (ROCEW and Geosystem Databases)  Global Change initiatives
              and NOAA's Office of Global Programs.
