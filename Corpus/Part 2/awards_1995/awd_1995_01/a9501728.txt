Abstract    :
              U. Cal Los Angeles  This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in
              support of   the research and teaching activities of  Dr. David C. Myles. The
              research   will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of self  
              assembled mono- and bilayers that serve as membrane mimics that will be   used
              to study fundamental parameters of interfacial recognition, orient   complex
              structures in the membrane, and carry out catalytic   transformations.
              Receptors such as bis-aminopyridines  will be tethered   to the surface of the
              monolayer membrane to study the effects of the   environment on the surface and
              the binding and detection of ligands such   as alkylbarbiturates.  The
              information gained through this research will   be used to self assemble
              membranes that model cell membranes by   incorporating helical peptides.  These
              systems will be used to model   complex membrane proteins such as
              bacteriorhodopsin.  The teaching plan   will address issues specific to
              communicating chemistry to the large   classes encountered at UCLA without
              losing sight of the individual. The   focus will be on individualized
              education, organic chemistry curriculum   development, mentoring , and outreach
              programs in elementary and junior   high schools.  The goal of this research is
              to gain insight into membrane bound   phenomena through study of well defined
              chemical events in the context of   structurally proscribed systems. Such
              studies are surface and interfacial   analogues of molecular recognition in
              solution and are relevant to   recognition phenomena in cell membranes. This
              research will also provide   high quality research opportunities for both
              graduate and undergraduate   students.
