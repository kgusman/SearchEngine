Abstract    :
              9501531  BAUER    Organic carbon pools will be studied at two open ocean sites
              that  reflect potential differences in carbon cycling and transformations  in
              polar and temperate regions.  Carbon isotopic signatures   ( 14C, 13C) and
              concentrations of dissolved, colloidal and  particulate organic carbon
              (DOC,COC,POC) will be measured at  Station M in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and
              in the Antarctic Ocean  south of the Indian Ocean.  The following carbon pools
              will be  studied: ultra-violet and high-temperature catalytically-oxidizable 
              fractions of DOC (DOCuv and DOChtc), suspended and sinking POC  (POCsusp and
              POCsink), COC specific organic constituents (total  hydrolyzable amino acids 
              THAA , total carbohydrates  TCHO , total  lipids) of suspended and sinking POC
              and of COC, detrital  aggregates on the seafloor, marine snow, and dissolved
              inorganic  carbon (DIC).    The following questions will be addressed: 1) Do
              the  14C profiles  in Antarctic DOC, POCsusp, and COC support the hypothesis
              that deep  DOC is transported quasi-conservatively through the world's deep 
              ocean? 2) How does the lateral transport of shelf/slope derived  organic matter
              to the deep sea change with time and what is the  extent of adsorption of DOC
              onto POCsusp and POCsink in the water  column? 3) From what depths do specific
              organic constituents of the  COC,POCsink, and POCsusp, originate and how are
              they recycled?   4) What are the sources of carbon to detrital aggregates and
              marine  snow, and are the labile, surface-derived compounds utilized 
              exclusively during remineralization? 5) What is the overall labile  and
              refractory nature of DOC with respect to its heterotrophic  utilization, and
              what does the  14C signature of microheterotrophic  biomass reveal about the
              assimilation of DOC/COC/POC in the deep  ocean?
