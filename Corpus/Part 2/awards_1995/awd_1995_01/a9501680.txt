Abstract    :
              Active noise control is the suppression of unwanted noise via  destructive
              interference using a digital signal processing system  with sensors and
              actuators.  The goal of this research is to  achieve significant performance
              gains and computational complexity  reductions in active noise control
              technology through fundamental  research in multichannel algorithm design and
              analysis, to enable  the wider use of this technology in industrial and
              consumer  markets.  These efforts include:           1.     the development of
              computationally-efficient, gradient-  based adaptive controllers employing
              simplified updating  strategies;         2.     the application of
              least-squares and orthogonalization  methods for robust and
              statistically-efficient filter adaptation;         3.     the design of
              multichannel subband implementations of  active noise controllers using
              adaptive infinite impulse-response  filters; and         4.     analysis and
              development of multichannel system  identification methods that require a
              minimum of processing  capability and that provide robust performance in
              time-varying  situations.    The research effort includes both system
              simulation and hardware  development to verify the underlying principles,
              performances, and  constraints of real-world active noise control systems.   
              To be most useful, an engineering education must forge a  relationship between
              the capabilities of various technologies and  the needs of the community
              at-large.  The goal of this effort is to  maintain the relevance of an
              engineering education by bringing the  industrial, societal, and academic
              communities closer together  through individual and group interaction. 
              Activities to foster  this interaction include:           1.     promoting
              joint university/industry technical projects  through participation in the
              University of Utah Engineering Clinic  Program;         2.     incorporating
              research activities in active noise control  within the undergraduate and
              graduate curriculum through individual  clas s projects;         3.    
              developing an integrated electrical engineering  curriculum through
              departmental committee work; and         4.     reaching out to the community
              through Engineering Career  Days and the advising of prospective transfer
              students.    The educational effort involves the design of new course projects,
               committee work at the Department level, and extensive interaction  with
              students, other educators, and members of the local community.
