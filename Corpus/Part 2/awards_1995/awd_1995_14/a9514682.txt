Abstract    :
                   This project explores what appear to be deep and surprising  connections
              between two areas of linguistic structure that are  superficially quite
              diverse: on the one hand, clitic elements  (such as Romance pronominals,
              Warlpiri Auxiliaries, etc.) and on  the other, formal reflections of the
              morphological properties of  words. A theory of the structure of words and of
              their relations  to one another, developed in previous research by the P1 and 
              known as "A-Morphous Morphology," has as one important component  the claim
              that clitics serve a function within the phrase which  is closely parallel to
              that filled by affixes (and other  morphological markers) within words. This
              research intends to  develop and explore the consequences of that observation. 
                   The research to be conducted will enrich our understanding  of a number of
              areas of linguistic structure (phonology,  morphology and syntax) and their
              inter-relation. It will also  lead to refinements in our understanding of a
              range of current  linguistic theories, including A-Morphous Morphology,
              Optimality  Theory, and Minimalist syntax. As a by-product of research into 
              such theoretical questions, the project will also result in  descriptive
              studies of languages with rich but poorly documented  systems of clitics, such
              as the Rumantsch dialects of Switzerland  and Italy.
