Abstract    :
              9514575  MANDLER    This research will examine the development of conceptual
              thought  in infancy and early childhood.  Until recently there has been  little
              experimental work on this topic, but it has been assumed  that infants first
              form concepts about concrete objects, such as  dogs, chairs, and cars, and only
              later develop broader concepts  of animals, furniture, and vehicles.  However,
              prior research  from Mandler's laboratory indicates that the broader concepts 
              actually precede the more specific ones.  For example,  6-month-olds can see
              the difference between dogs and cats but  conceptually they treat them both as
              the same kind of thing.   This research will extend these findings to show how
              infants from  9 to 15 months form their first inductive generalizations about 
              the characteristics of animals, vehicles, and other classes, for  example, how
              they determine what kind of objects eat and what  kind of objects get ridden. 
              Several recently-devised techniques  will be used to study these issues.  One
              technique is to measure  how infants categorize little models of real-world
              objects.  Another technique is to see whether infants are more willing to 
              imitate appropriate behavior on these objects (such as giving a  dog a drink)
              than inappropriate behavior (giving a car a drink).  The research will also
              study early comprehension of object  labels, to see how broadly or narrowly
              infants interpret their  meaning.  The overall goal of the research is to
              provide a  systematic body of knowledge about the preverbal foundations of 
              concept formation and thought and its relation to early language  acquisition
              and preschool learning.  ***
