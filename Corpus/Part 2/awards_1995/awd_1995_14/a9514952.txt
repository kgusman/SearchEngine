Abstract    :
              9514952  Rosenau    This project, the sixth phase of a long-term collaborative
              project, will seize the opportunity offered by the dramatic developments that
              have transformed world politics in the years since the end of the Cold War. 
              The purpose is to advance understanding of the dynamics whereby the United
              States responds and adapts to a world that is no longer marked by the euphoria
              of the Cold War's end.  While Phase VI of the Foreign Policy Leadership Project
              (FPLP) is partially designed to assess the stability of earlier findings, its
              primary intent is to explore how the belief systems of American leaders have
              been affected by the continuing disarray of world affairs and the diminishing
              prospects for a new global order founded on multilateral principles.    The
              earlier studies of the American leadership community found that a) a
              pre-Vietnam foreign policy consensus had been replaced by several internally
              consistent, largely mutually exclusive and durable belief systems; b) for the
              most part these sharp cleavages were not bridged in the face of numerous
              challenges; c) discernible ideological and partisan differences prevail between
              the foreign and domestic policy belief systems of leaders; and, d) nonetheless
              certain issues, notably those involving Israel and trade, stand out as
              anomalous with respect to the overall findings.  Using the same survey methods
              employed in the earlier research, this project applies and tests a theory of
              political adaptation designed to account for 1) any major changes that have
              occurred in leadership belief systems as a result of such seminal events as the
              recent failures of the United Nations, the intensification of tensions with
              Russia, the outbreak of conflict in Chechnya, and the advent of tensions over
              trade with Japan; 2) how the long-standing habits of thought developed during
              the decades prior to the collapse of the USSR have been affected by the end of
              the Cold War; 3) the degree to which unilateralist and isolationist tendencies
              have been fostered by di sappointments abroad as well as domestic terrorism and
              mounting tensions over the country's social and economic agenda; 4) those
              dimensions of the various belief systems that have remained stable in the face
              of changes in world and national politics; and, 5) the ways in which the
              transformations at home and abroad may have induced tendencies toward a more
              widespread consensus or toward ever deeper cleavages within the American
              leadership community.    This is a data resource that will be used widely by
              scholars interested in the topic.  ***
