Abstract    :
              9514149  Mark    This U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative Research award will study 
              "Environmentally Friendly Manufacturing of Polymeric Materials  from Neutral
              Wastes."  The principal researchers are Dr. J. E.  Mark of the University of
              Cincinnati, and Dr. B. S. Fakirov of  Sofia University.  Theoretical
              developments indicate that  unusually good mechanical properties can be
              obtained by drying  swollen networks of semi-rigid chains while they are in the
               deformed state.  This approach was recently demonstrated for  cellulosic
              esters and ethers and for some poly(n-  alkylisiocyanates), yielding increases
              in Young's modulus and  tensile strength by factors of 4 to 5.  The proposed
              study aims  at extension of these successful experiments to collagen in the 
              form of highly-degradable gelatin.  This material is particularly  suited for
              the development of such techniques for a number of  reasons, including: (1)
              possibility of production from natural  wastes using very mild processing
              conditions; (2) water  solubility; (3) biodegradability, with absence of
              pollution  problems; (4) low cost; and (5) consumability as a food product.  
              The expectation is to develop laboratory-scale technology for  manufacturing
              gelatin fibers and films with improved mechanical  properties potentially
              usable as commodity materials and goods.   Depending on the results obtained,
              an attempt could be made to  commercialize the optimized technology.    This
              research in chemistry fulfills the program objectives of  bringing together
              leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to  combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality,  reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***
