Abstract    :
                9514974  Grossman    This Accomplishment-Based Renewal of the NSF grant
              entitled "the  Political Economy of International Trade Relations" continues
              the  study of the formation of policies that affect international  trade.  The
              analytic approach involves formal modeling of the  incentives facing
              politically motivated elected representatives,  and the actions taken by
              special interest groups in pursuit of  particularlistic benefits.  The ongoing
              research concentrates in  three main areas.  First, it examines the dynamics of
              trade  policy in response to a one-shot change in the terms of trade and  to
              recurring shifts in comparative advantage.  The analysis  incorporates
              politicians who have short-time horizons and who  cannot commit the future
              course of trade policy.  Second, it  studies the design of political rules and
              institutions, both  domestic and international, that can promote more efficient
              trade  policy outcomes.  Finally, it integrates this work and related  research
              on the political economy of trade policy, in the form of  an integrative
              monograph covering a range of topics and  approaches.         Recent public
              debate over trade policy has pitted  environmentalists against free trade
              interests.  The previous  work by the investigators demonstrated that there is
              no  presumption that trade liberalization will be harmful to the  environment. 
              In this project the investigators examine the  political economy of the
              interaction between different policy  issues.  Suppose that environmentalists
              expect that environmental  standards at home will be looser if trade is freer
              than if trade  barriers protect special interests in the import-competing 
              industries.  Then the environmentalists might support protection  in order to
              secure stricter standards and prevent "downward  harmonization," even if trade
              protection is not directly in their  own interest.
