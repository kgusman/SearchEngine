Abstract    :
                The Bayesian Method of Moments (BMOM) approach to statistical and econometric
              estimation, prediction, and model formulation allows to the researcher to
              obtain parameter estimates without the distributional assumptions required for
              traditional Bayesian analysis.  The objectives of this research project are (1)
              to develop further and provide additional applications of the BMOM approach;
              (2) to compare BMOM and traditional Bayesian and non-Bayesian inference
              techniques and develop procedures for choosing between and/or combing BMOM and
              traditional Bayesian results; and (3) to utilize BMOMs and other procedures in
              applied model formulation and forecasting applications involving multivariate
              dynamic statistical and econometric models useful in gaining understanding of
              past experience and in point and turning point forecasting.  Applications will
              involve modeling and forecasting output growth rates for 18 or more
              industrialized economies and analyses of U.S. regional petroleum markets.  Past
              experience has indicated and it is anticipated that new experience with the
              BMOM approach will indicate that it is operational, simpler than previous
              approaches, and yields very satisfactory results.
