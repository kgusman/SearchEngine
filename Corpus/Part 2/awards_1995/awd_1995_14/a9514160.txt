Abstract    :
              9514160  Zagare    This investigation refines and extends a generic two-stage
              escalation model of incomplete information.  In this game-theoretic model,
              Defender is provided with two distinct ways (other than outright capitulation)
              to resist a challenge.  The Challenger is unsure of Defender's willingness to
              resist either by responding-in-kind or by escalating.  Previous examinations of
              this model find that the status quo is almost as tenuous under policies that
              requires flexibility at the local level as it is under deployment policies that
              rely completely on strategic threats to deter aggression.  Limited conflicts
              are most likely in the policy space between the extremes of Massive Retaliation
              and Flexible Response.    The research  generalizes and extends the underlying
              models to explore certain theoretical issues raised in the course of  the
              investigator's prior research, and moves it toward an empirical test.  To
              increase model verisimilitude, Defender's capability is treated as a variable,
              the number of conflict stages are increased, the sub-strategic options
              available to Defender expanded, Defender's decision-making separated at each
              stage, and the asymmetry assumption dropped.  The end result is a firmer
              understanding of how acute interstate crises can be managed, how escalation can
              be controlled, when and why extended deterrence works and, especially, how
              limited conflicts can be kept limited.  The breakup of the Soviet Union and the
              subsequent disintegration of the Warsaw Pact heightens both the significance
              and urgency of these important policy problems.  ***
