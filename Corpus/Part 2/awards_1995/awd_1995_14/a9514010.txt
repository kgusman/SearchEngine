                                          Abstract    Jeanne  9514010    The number of workers
              in some social insect colonies can  reach millions, yet they cooperate with one
              another and the  colonies smoothly accomplish all their necessary tasks.  It 
              has recently been discovered for a tropical social wasp that  the larger the
              colony, the greater its productive output per  worker.  This pattern
              contradicts previous understanding and  has direct implications for the
              evolution of colony size.  The purpose of the proposed research is to learn how
              the  behavior of workers in large colonies is organized  differently from that
              of small colonies and how these  differences give rise to the differences in
              productivity.      The research will be conducted on colonies in the field. 
              New colonies are founded by swarms of workers and queens.  Newly-founded
              colonies of different sizes will be made to  repair nest damage to provide data
              on numbers of workers  performing each type of work and their individual rates
              of  work.  Experimental manipulation of nest repair activity  will be used to
              reveal the behavioral cues workers use to  make decisions about whether to
              become active or idle.  At  the end of 25 days the colonies will be collected
              and the  size measured (number of workers).  The behavioral results  will be
              correlated with colony size to determine how the  changes in behavior at
              different colony size translate into  per capita differences in output.    The
              results of this study will explain the relationship  between the behavior of
              group members and group size.  The  resulting knowledge of the underlying
              mechanisms will  enhance our understanding of the evolution of large colony 
              size in social insects and may provide insights into how  human groups
              organize.
