Abstract    :
              9514329  Hendrix  Partical support is requested for a conference entitled 
              "Virus Assembly" to be held under the auspices of the Federation of American
              Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) from June 22 to June 27, 1996, at
              theVermont Academy, Saxtons River, Vermont.  The purpose of the conference is
              to bring together scientists working on all aspects of virus assembly and
              structure (including the initial disassembly steps associated with viral entry
              into cells) for bacterial, plant, animal and human viruses.  The intention is
              to encourage communication of ideas and hypotheses about virus assembly and
              structure, across the usual taxonomic barriers, and to promote dissemination of
              results obtained with a variety of different viruses using a variety of
              different experimental approaches, including biochemical and genetic methods as
              well as X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and image reconstruction. 
              There are no other confereces devoted entirely to problems of virus assembly
              and structure, across the viral taxonomic groups, except the  previous two
              FASEB conferences on this topic held in 1990, 1992 and 1994.  The previous
              conferences in  this series were enormously successful and achieved the kind of
              communication desired.  It seems likely, given the current rate of progress in
              this field, that the FASEB conference of 1996 will be the fourth in an ongoing
              series of conferences on the topic of virus assembly and structure.  %%%  The
              assembly of component parts into complete viruses is an area of intensive
              current study.  Many aspects of this work involve both structural and
              biological features, and the disassembly/reassembly processes that occur when
              viruses enter cells.  In order to bring together the latest results in these
              areas this conference will include most of the scientists actively engaged in
              this research. The conference will lead to greater understanding of the
              processes of viral assembly.  ***
