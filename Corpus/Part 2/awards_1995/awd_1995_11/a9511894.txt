Abstract    :
              Stiner    This award under the NSF Faculty Early Career Development  competition
              will provide five years of support to Dr. Mary Stiner  to further her
              paleoanthropological research in Israel, to permit  her to develop a laboratory
              at the University of Arizona and to  allow the incorporation students into her
              project. The funding  will permit her and a student to travel to Israel each
              year to  conduct preliminary analyses of faunal materials recovered  through
              archaeological excavation. A sample will be shipped to  the Arizona facility
              where they will be subjected to extensive  examination. Funds will also permit
              the purchase of necessary  research and training equipment and laboratory
              supplies and will  provide student support.     Dr. Stiner's study centers on
              the analysis of recently excavated  faunas from Hayonim Cave in Israel. The
              work investigates the  human foraging niche in the Near East during the late
              Middle  through early Upper Pleistocene geologic periods, a question 
              fundamental to understanding the origins of modern humans in this  region. The
              long faunal sequence at Hayonim is important because  it fills a unique and
              crucial gap in our knowledge about the  emergence of anatomically modern
              humans. During this period  between ca. 200,000  to 50,000 years ago two
              different kinds of  humans were present in the Near East. One of these was
              directly  ancestral to modern day peoples and archaeologists wish to 
              understand their behavior and how they adapted to their changing  environment.
              Through the analysis of faunal remains, it will be  possible to reconstruct
              environmental change over time and to  gain insight into the ways in which
              people utilized the range of  animal resources available to them.    This
              research is important for several reasons. It will shed new  light on
              human-environment interactions. It will provide insight  into the emergence of
              modern behaviors, support the research and  teaching career of a promising
              young scientist and assist in  student training.
