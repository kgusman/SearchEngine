              Stanford University SBR-9511208   This proposal consists of four related
              projects.  The first project is joint with Drew Fudenberg and involves the
              completion of ongoing research on boundedly rational learning in games.  The
              second project aims to provide an axiomatic approach to  uncertainty aversion
              -- the tendency of people to avoid situations in which the probabilities of
              different outcomes are unknown-- and to link it with satisficing behavior. 
              This work could help account for such puzzles as the Ellsberg paradox.  The
              third project is joint with Bent Holmstrom and will seek to provide a
              theoretical foundation to the prevalence of unsecured promises in social
              transactions. The fourth project is a dynamic extension of previous work by the
              P.I. on unforeseen contingencies.                         ;
