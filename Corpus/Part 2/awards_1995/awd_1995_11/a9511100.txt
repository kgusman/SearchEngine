Abstract    :
              Crime and violence have pervasive impacts on the development of America's human
              capital.  The fear, disruption of activities, physical mayhem, and financial
              losses that they produce clearly reduce the productivity of the workforce,
              limit the effectiveness of our schools, destroy our families, weaken our
              neighborhoods, increase disadvantage, and pose the most serious threat to those
              plagued by poverty and deprivation.  The development of a scientific
              understanding of the causes and consequences of crime and violence, how to
              prevent them, protect their victims, and justly punish their perpetrators
              should be a top public priority.    Media coverage of crime tends to be
              sensationalistic and episodic, focusing on crimes that are heavily laden with
              violence and/or racial elements.  The increasingly sensationalistic tendencies
              of the mass media and continued racial divisions within American society have
              fueled public debate over the meaning of crime and the appropriate social
              responses.     This study the links between media coverage of crime and
              attitudes about race and attitudes about violence.  The general premise is that
              race-related considerations play an important role in the public's
              understanding of crime and that these considerations account for the general
              shift toward a punitive and retributive orientation. A set of experimental
              manipulations of TV news stories is designed to examine their impact and focus
              of public attention.  Two classes of explanations are distinguished in these
              experiments.  The first rests on the pattern of news coverage.  The second set
              rests on effect of longstanding racial stereotypes in addition to racial cues
              provided by the media on public interpretation of the news.
