Abstract    :
              IBN-9511971  Clemens, Lynwood G.      Reproductive success in most species
              depends on both humoral and  neural responses acting coordinately.  The
              majority of studies have  focused on the male as the critical component for
              determining  successful outcomes, however, female reproductive tract function
              is  also significant, and yet underinvestigated.  In the present work,  Dr.
              Clemens will focus on the effects of hormones on uterine  contractions and the
              role of these contractions in the initiation  of pregnancy.  By recording
              electrical activity of uterine muscles,  it will be possible to determine what
              stimuli are important for the  induction of uterine activity around the time of
              ovulation and  whether these responses are associated with the release of
              hormones  from the ovary involved in the initiation of pregnancy.  The 
              experiments will provide new and exciting information on the role  of the
              female reproductive system in pregnancy initiation and  reproductive success in
              mammals.
