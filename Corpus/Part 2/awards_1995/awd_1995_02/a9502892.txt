Abstract    :
              DMS-9502892 Eaves  This research is to be directed along three  closely related
              concepts,  namely, the solution of equations and  paths of equations with 
              homotopies, the solution of parametric  or short paths of equations  with
              infinitesimals and ordered  fields, and the formalisms of a linear  problem and
              linear  algorithm. The essence of the first concept is  following the  path of
              solutions where there is one dimension of  freedom, while  perhaps, using
              approximations, subdivisions, and/or  Newton's  method. The essence of the
              second concept is doing  arithmetic  with infinitesimals and, transferring
              algorithms, problems  and  solutions from one ordered field to another. For
              certain problems   and algorithms a parametric version of the problem can be
              solved  by  lifting it to an ordered field containing an infinitesimal to 
              obtain a  single problem, the original algorithm is run in the  new ordered
              field,  and the solution is lowered to the original  field to obtain a short
              path  of solutions to the parametric  problem. The essence of the third 
              concept is the precise  identification of what a linear problem is and  what
              type of  algorithms solve them.   This research is to be directed along  the
              concepts related to the  solution of systems of equations;  the pertinent
              systems of equations  are widely applicable in  engineering, science, and
              management.
