Abstract    :
              9502109  Sutherland   This Faculty Early Career Development award will focus on
              the environmental aspects of industries that build or use machine tools.  The
              research focus is on environmentally conscious design and manufacture (ECDM) as
              it pertains to machine tool systems.  Design research issues will define and
              develop product value models to weigh tradeoffs on materials, features, etc.,
              that affect their reuse or re-manufacturability.  Manufacturing research issues
              emphasize ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of fluids in machining
              systems.  The research plan will integrate well with MTU's participation in the
              NSF/ARPA funded Machine Tool Agile Manufacturing Institute, as well as an EPA
              sponsored Center for Clean Industrial Treatment Technology.  The educational
              focus complements this with courses that emphasize the environmental issues in
              the design and manufacture of discrete parts.  These courses will be available
              at MTU, but also to industry using distance learning technology.  Sutherland
              brings an outstanding background as an educator, winning campus or statewide
              awards for his teaching and mentoring activities, which adds to the strength of
              this proposal's clear and achievable educational plan.   The high probability
              of new discovery in this fertile area, coupled with education plan for both
              students and practicing engineers, will have a high future impact for industry
              and overall competitiveness.  ***
