              PRIVATE    Agris RNA synthesis, chemistry, structure and function are central
              to the viability of all biological systems and thus, are important to
              agricultural, medical and environmental research. This research has led to
              biotechnological applications of RNA as both target and reagent. Even though
              the first RNA structure was resolved some twenty years ago, only now are we
              beginning to understand RNA interaction with proteins through combined use of x
              ray crystallography, NMR, biochemical, molecular biological and genetic
              approaches. New and exciting RNA structures have been discovered and are
              revealing interesting new functional modes of interaction with proteins. 
              However, no meetings have focused exclusively on the topic of RNA protein
              interactions to create an environment of intellectual exchange and a forum to
              share data and techniques. Many different groups are using a variety of
              approaches to understand the plasticity of RNA and how RNA structure is
              recognized by proteins. Thus, a Symposium on RNA Protein Interactions would be
              timely. Seven major researchers (six from the USA, one fro m Europe) have
              already accepted invitations to speak at a Symposium on October 13 15, 1995 in
              the North Carolina Research Triangle. Funds amounting to almost half the
              estimated cost of the conference have already been obtained.  This proposal
              requests NSF funding for stipends for one major speaker and three young
              investigators. The requested funds are approximately 10% of the estimated total
              budget. %%% RNA synthesis, chemistry, structure and function are central to the
