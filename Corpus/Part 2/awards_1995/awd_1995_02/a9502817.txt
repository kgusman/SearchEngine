Abstract    :
                  9502817  Vernekar         The objective of this project is to investigate
              various aspects of the behavior of the Indian  monsoon.  The principal
              investigator will develop a regional model which is appropriate for  testing
              hypotheses concerning mechanisms governing the onset of the monsoon, the
              northward  propagation of the onset over the Indian subcontinent, monsoon break
              periods, and monsoon  withdrawal.  Towards this end, the principal investigator
              already has successfully linked the  National Meteorological Center's (NMC) eta
              model to the global general circulation model to  simulate monsoon behavior. 
              The eta model is used primarily for short-range predictions and  simulates a
              number of physical processes including the physics of the boundary layer, the
              diurnal  cycle, radiation interactions with clouds, and convection.  The
              surface physics module, currently  a simple slab energy and bucket hydrology
              model, will be replaced with a state-of-the-art  biosphere model.  This
              biosphere model should provide more realistic representations of the 
              hydrologic cycle as governed by soil moisture and vegetation.  Once
              implemented, the coupled  model's simulated surface fluxes will be compared
              with observations.  The coupled model will  then be used to simulate the
              monsoon from the beginning of May to the end of September.  To  assess the
              ability of the model to simulate the space-time variability of the monsoon, the
              time-  averaged fields as well as the transient characteristics produced will
              be compared with those  from observation.  Finally, the various hypotheses of
              monsoon behavior will be tested with the  coupled model.    ***
