Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Manglik  U/ Cincinnati  CTS-9502128    The research in this proposal
              will aid in understanding the effect of non-Newtonian fluids (which includes
              most fluids in the food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, pulp and paper,
              chemical processing and biomedical industries) on heat transfer due to
              convection in duct flow and in pool boiling. The experimental work will be
              complemented by a numerical study of flow through geometries of the type common
              to extended surface heat exchangers. This work could affect the future design
              of heat exchange equipment used in the industries mentioned above.    The
              educational plan will bring the research program directly into the classroom
              through introduction of a senior elective course in Industrial Heat Exchange
              Engineering and Design and the development of new experiments in the
              undergraduate heat transfer and fluid mechanics laboratory. These will involve
              modern measurement methods such as liquid crystal thermography, LDV, and
              contemporary flow measurement techniques, as well as experiments that
              demonstrate heat transfer measurements in contemporary applications such as 
              plate-fin exchangers, heat recovery systems, and micro-electronic cooling.
