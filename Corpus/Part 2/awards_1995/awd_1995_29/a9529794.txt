Abstract    :
              9529794  Leaman    In conjunction with companion projects by Drs. S.Riser of the
               University of Washington and R. Schmitt of the Woods Hole  Oceanographic
              Institution, approximately 145 profiling P-ALACE  (Profiling Autonomous
              Lagrangian and Circulation Explorer) floats  (at least half of them with
              salinity) will be used to study  specific water-mass transformation processes
              in the tropical and  subtropical Atlantic as part of the Atlantic Circulation
              and  Climate Experiment (ACCE).  The basin-wide grid will be used to  provide
              relatively uniform sampling to track upper layer salinity  and heat content
              changes throughout the basin.  Higher resolution  arrays will be deployed in
              important local regions where water  masses such as the high-salinity
              Subtropical Underwater (Leaman),  relatively uniform 18-degree water (Riser)
              are formed or  transformed, or where important air-sea exchanges are highly 
              variable such as under the ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone)  (R.
              Schmitt).  The higher-resolution will allow tracking of  seasonal and
              interannual changes in the volume and structure of  the upper ocean features,
              and relate these to modeled/observed  estimates of surface heat and fresh water
              fluxes.    Analysis of these data will provide time series of three- 
              dimensional maps of the velocity, temperature, and salinity  fields within the
              upper 1500 m of the tropical and subtropical  gyres over the duration of the
              ACCE field experiment.  Additionally, statistical analyses will provide spatial
               distributions of mean circulation and quantities like eddy  kinetic and
              potential energies, and eddy mixing, in addition  to the flux estimates.  These
              gyre-wide estimates will provide  strong constraints for the future climate
              models that must be  developed to adequately include the physics of the
              tropical and  subtropical Atlantic, particularly the fresh water budget.  ***
