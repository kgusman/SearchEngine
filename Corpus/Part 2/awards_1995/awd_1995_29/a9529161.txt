Abstract    :
              9529161  RATNER       The Engineering Research Center for Engineered
              Biomaterials  (UWEB) at the University of Washington is established with the 
              primary objective to exploit specific biological recognition  mechanisms in
              order to develop new generation of biomaterials for  medical implants that will
              heal in the body in a facile,  physiologically normal manner.  A new generation
              of biomaterials  will be developed that can interact with specific cell
              receptors or  bind with appropriate proteins, and then initiate the desired 
              biological responses allowing control of healing.  Direct spin-offs  from this
              approach include affinity chromatography supports,  biosensors, nonfouling
              surfaces, manipulation of inflammation and  cell culture substrates.  An
              interdisciplinary team of materials  scientists, molecular and biologists,
              biomolecular engineers, and  physicians will collaborate in three independent
              thrust areas:  (1)  Design, synthesis and characterization of new molecular
              materials,  (2) Modulation of cell signaling to develop biomaterials that heal,
               and (3) Medical application and healing.  The major knowledge  advancement
              will be mainly in the area of understanding the biology  of healing at the
              molecular level and consequently, on the ability  to manipulate the macrophage
              cells.  The technology advancement  will be the coupling of materials
              engineered at the molecular level  into macroscopic signaling system of the
              human organism which will  lead to radically different kinds of medical
              implants.  The UWEB  will begin with twenty seven sponsoring companies
              collaborating in  the research program and technology transfer activities. 
              Industry  will participate in research as resident technical fellows, and  will
              be involved in clinical research and testing which will not be  funded by the
              NSF award.  The Center will provide integrated  education and training in life
              sciences and engineering to the  graduate and undergraduate students through
              new courses, teaching  laboratories, and self-paced t utorials.  The
              University's K-12 and  High School Outreach Programs will be expanded to
              include the  activities of the UWEB.  The ERC will collaborate with the NSF 
              supported ECSEL Coalition Program.  ***
