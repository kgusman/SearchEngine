              Hershkowitz/University of Wisconsin    Title:  Helicon Wave Studies    In this
              research, a high density helicon plasma source will be developed. The helicon
              plasma source is anticipated as the highest density plasma source for
              semiconductor plasma processing applications. In these experiments the high
              density helicon source will be generated through use of increased rf-power and
              multiple antennas to couple efficiently to all regimes of the helicon
              dispersion relation: one antenna for low power operation in the collisionless
              regime to initiate the plasma and a second antenna operating at higher power to
              increase helicon plasma density in the collisional regime.  A short pulse (10
              ms) of 50 kW of rf will be injected via the second antenna into a low power
              steady state to obtain densities of > 1014 cm-3.  In addition to providing a
              high density large volume plasma source, these experiments will test the
              parameter scalings and physical models in regimes not fully explored.   The
              non-appearance of the m=-1 mode, an open fundamental question, will be
              especially explored using an antenna configuration designed to force its
              generation.  A very important part of the proposed research is the development
              of new diagnostics needed for such high density plasmas. Diagnostics for these
              experiments will include a ruby laser Thompson scattering system for electron
              temperature measurements, to replace the Langmuir probes which would not
              operate under the experimental conditions; and a microwave interferometry
              system available from he Phaedrus-B Tandem mirror to allow measurement of wave
              dispersion.  Segmented endloss detectors, retarding field energy analyzers, and
              Pt grid bolometric radiation detectors will provide data to determine power
              scaling and power balance of the high density pulsed plasma.
