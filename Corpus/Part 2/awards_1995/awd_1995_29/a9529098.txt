Abstract    :
              AST  95-29098  PI:  Sandra Faber         Spectroscopic Surveys of the Distant
              Universe         Current spectroscopic surveys of distant galaxies are  now
              probing down to 22 magnitude in the I wavelength band  (in the infrared).
              However, the refurbished Hubble Space  Telescope is providing images yielding
              morphology and  photometry down to I = 26, or 40 times fainter. Lack of 
              spectra on these very faint galaxies limits the amount of  information
              available from the HST images. To close the gap,  two separate but parallel
              spectroscopic surveys are planned,  using the 10-m Keck I telescope and its
              LRIS spectrograph.  The first survey, comprising Phase I of the DEEP (Deep 
              Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe) Project, will be of about  600 distant field
              galaxies; the other will be of about 400  high-redshift galaxies in nine
              clusters. The data will be  used in concert with Hubble images to catalog the
              galactic  content of the distant Universe between z ~ 0.5 and 1.0, and  use
              this comparison to characterize the nature of galactic  evolution over roughly
              the latter half of the lifetime of  the Universe. A public archive of all the
              data taken under  the aegis of this proposal, both spectroscopic and imaging, 
              will be made available electronically after a two-year  proprietary period.
