              9529810  Maga=F1a-Rueda  This proposal will organize a group of scientists from
              Mexico, the United   States, Central America, and the Caribbean with the main
              objective of   bringing together, into an Inter-American Institute (IAI)
              Regional Center,   members of those scientific communities with common
              interests in the study   of the IAI scientific theme "El Ni=F1o Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO) and   Interannual Climate Variability," as well as in the
              theme   "Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions in the Intertropical Americas."  
              Specifically, the objectives of the Regional Center will be achieved through  
              periodic meetings during which members of the group will inform, discuss and  
              examine their work within the framework of the IAI Science Agenda.  The  
              objectives of the meeting are:  to promote greater collaboration and flow of  
              information and expertise among the members of the IAI Regional Center; to  
              constitute a scientific forum where critical discussions abut the  
              achievements in joint scientific projects can be held; to encourage  
              participation of individuals at all levels in multinational projects in the  
              field of climate variability; and to promote educational and training  
              activities in the field of climate change.  Meteorological and   climatological
              data bases for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean will   also be
              compiled.  Preliminary versions of these data bases will be   distributed among
              members of the Research Center to prepare stud ies aimed at   proposal
              preparation for joint work.  The proposed Regional Center would be composed of
              a group of research   institutions which share their resources for the study of
              particular   problems.  The Regional Center would also be a forum in which
              critical   discussions of the collaborative studies could be held, and it would
                promote scientific excellence.  The collaborative projects of this proposed  
              Regional Center would enhance the interest in studying various aspects of  
              climate change and would educate new generations of scientists.  The   results
              of these projects would be made available to other scientists   studying
              cross-cutting issues such as human dimensions of climate change   and training
              and education.  %%%  This proposal will organize a group of scientists from
              Mexico, the United   States, Central America, and the Caribbean with the main
              objective of   bringing together, into an Inter-American Institute (IAI)

              theme   "Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions in the Intertropical Americas."  
              Specifically, the objectives of the Regional Center will be achieved  through
              periodic meetings during which members of the group will inform,   discuss and
              examine in a critical manner their work within the framework of   the IAI
              Science Agenda.  The objectives of the meeting agenda are: to   promote grater
              collaboration and flow of information and expertise among   the members of the
              IAI Regional Center; to constitute a scientific forum   where critical
              discussions abut the achievements in joint scientific   projects can be held;
              to encourage participation of individuals at all   levels in multinational
              projects in the field of climate variability; and   to promote educational and
              training activities in the field of Climate   Change.  There is also a plan for
              the cr eation of a meteorological and   climatological data bases for Mexico,
              Central America and the Caribbean.   Preliminary versions of these data bases
              will be distributed among members   of the Center to prepare studies aimed at
              proposal preparation for joint   work.  ENSO and other climatic events involve
              interactions between the ocean and   atmosphere.  The signal of ENSO on Mexican
              climate also relates to   interactions with land, on local and on regional
              scales.  It has not been   until the last decade that some physical mechanisms
              associated with the   summer rainy season over Mexico have been identified. 
              For example, cold sea   surface temperature anomalies along the equatorial
              eastern Pacific seem to   lead to a strengthening of moisture convergence along
              the western coast of   Mexico and to an enhanced rainy season over the Mexican
              western coast. Most   of the climatic processes that affect Mexico are not
              geographically unique.  The richness of the climatic phenomena in Mexico,
              Central America and the   Caribbean has not been examined in as much detail as
              its mid-latitude or   tropical western Pacific counterparts.  This is due in
              part to the small   number of atmospheric scientists in the region, their
              traditional and   empirical approaches used to study meteorology and climate in
              the   operational centers, along with often incomplete databases.  In addition,
                inter-institutional collaboration in studying climate has been meager.  A  
              potential solution for these problems is cooperation through this proposed  
              Regional Center for the study of El Ni=F1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and  
              Internal Climate Variability, as well as Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions  
              in the Intertropical Americas.  The following countries are participating   in
              this proposal:  Costa Rica; Cuba; Mexico; Panama; and the United States.  
              These countries are Members States of the IAI, a U.S. initiative to   stimulate
              cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific  
              institutions of the Americas .  The U.S. National Science Foundation is the  
              U.S. Government agency designated to carry out U.S. responsibilities within  
              the IAI.  ***        --========================_13293532==_--
