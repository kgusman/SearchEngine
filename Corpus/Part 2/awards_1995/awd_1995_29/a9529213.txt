Abstract    :
              9529213  SETLOW       Changes in climate and other natural systems may have 
              profound impacts on health and the human condition in a variety  ways.  Natural
              system changes can have direct impacts on human  physiology, and they can have
              indirect affects by altering the  development and transmission of disease.  At
              the request of the  Committee on Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) of
              the  National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and the White  House Office
              of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the  Institute of Medicine and the
              National Research Council will  convene a two-day symposium in Washington in
              September 1995 to  address the complex interactions between human health and
              global  environmental change.  More than 300 scientists, health  professionals,
              and key decision makers from the public and  private sectors will participate
              in discussions designed to  identify aspects of human health-natural systems
              interaction that  require more research in the future.  A published proceedings
               will help disseminate results of those discussions to a much  broader
              audience.  Support for the planning and conduct of the  symposium is being
              shared by a number of CENR agencies.  This  award effectively provides support
              from NSF ($15,000), the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration
              ($25,000), and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ($15,000). 
                   This symposium will be an important gathering that brings  together
              leaders from a number of different communities whose  interests intersect
              because of the complex dynamics that link  human health and global change.  The
              symposium will provide  valuable insights into important problems, and it will
              provide  guidance to federal agencies participating in the U.S. Global  Change
              Research Program and other CENR-related activities.
