Abstract    :
              9529317  Cooper    This is an award to support conduct of a symposium the 
              objective of which is to bring together investigators who  are conducting
              research on the applications of ionizing  radiation in environmental
              engineering practice.  The  sources of ionizing radiation to be considered will
              include  gamma radiation for radioactive substances but will  concentrate on
              ionizing radiation produced by electron beam  accelerators.  The applications
              include processing of solid,  liquid and gaseous wastes to reduce their
              pollutional impact  on land, water and air resources and to improve the 
              efficiency of other physical, chemical and biological  processes used in waste
              treatment systems.    This symposium will be conducted in conjunction with the 
              International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies  that will be held
              in Honolulu, Hawaii from December 17-22,  1995.  The Congress is  sponsored
              jointly by the Canadian  Society for Chemistry, the Chemical Society of Japan,
              the  American Chemical Society, the New Zealand Institute of  Chemistry and the
              Royal Australian Chemical Institute.  Results of this symposium are expected to
              provide guidance  to the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in planning 
              support of further research on applications of ionizing  radiation in
              processing of contaminated and infected  liquids, solids and gases to reduce
              their pollutional  impacts on land, water and air.
