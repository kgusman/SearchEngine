Abstract    :
                Rea  OPP 9527067    Abstract  This award supports a project to define the
              paleoclimatic  variability during times of important climate change on 
              Antarctica, in the latest Cretaceous and Paleocene, late Eocene  and early
              Oligocene, and the early Pliocene.  Preliminary data  suggest that the
              Maastrichtian and possibly Paleocene environment  of Antarctica was dry enough
              to permit generation of sufficient  dust to form an important component of the
              sediments surrounding  the continent.  This research will determine if and when
              this  semi-arid climate did exist on Antarctica and when it was  superseded by
              more moist conditions.  The transition to fluvial  and hemipelagic dominated
              erosional processes may shed light on  the initial formation of glaciers in the
              Antarctic hinterland.  At the time of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, changing
              sediment  accumulation rates and the relative proportions of hemipelagic  and
              ice-rafted material will provide information on when the  Antarctic ice sheet
              became well-established, effectively shutting  off the supply of fluvial
              sediment to the Southern Ocean. And  finally, any significant change in the ice
              sheet configuration  during the early Pliocene should be readily observable in
              the  concomitant changes in the nature and rates of terrigenous  sedimentation.
               To accomplish these goals, this project will examine the  terrigenous
              component of deep sea sediments of the Southern  Ocean.  These materials
              contain a dual record of the environment  of Antarctica and of the sedimentary
              transport processes.  Techniques of mineral grain extraction, grain-size
              analysis,  magnetic fabric determination, geochemical characterization, and 
              flux calculation, all of which have proven diagnostic in the  interpretation of
              paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic conditions,  will be applied within this
              project to unravel the history of  environmental change on the Antarctic
              continent.
