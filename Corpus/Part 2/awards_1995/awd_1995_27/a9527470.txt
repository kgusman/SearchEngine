              Berry This is an award to support expenses for young investigators in two
              categories to attend the Tenth International Conference on Frankia and
              Actinorhizal Plants, held at the University of California, Davis, California,
              on August 6-11, 1995.  Travel expenses were provided for four outstanding young
              investigator,  invited symposium speakers,  whose work has led to major recent
              advances in the field of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.  Funds were also used to
              provide partial support for young investigators with excellent research
              programs and whose students made presentations, or who otherwise had need for
              financial support. The topic of this meeting was both timely and important in
              understanding the extent of biodiversity which exists. It is well known that
              bacteria alone function to continually introduce molecular nitrogen into the
              biosphere, a process upon which all eucaryotic life owes its existence.  In
              this plan, plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixation occurs via two recognized systems,
              the rhizobium/bradyrhizobium nodulation mechanism and the  frankia /plant
              association.  Based on present know ledge, the latter plant association occurs
              predominantly in association with fast-growing trees (both temperate and
              tropical region) and tropical grasses.  Unfortunately,  this route for nitrogen
              fixation has received limited attention, although it is perhaps the most
              important  entry  port for molecular nitrogen into the biosphere in
              environmental bioreclamation projects, particularly in tropical regions.   As a
              result of this and because of the importance of learning more about how this
              activity operates, the conference proceedings will be published as a volume of
              Physiologia Plantarum.  A significant number of highly productive young
              investigators attended the conference, which provided an important forum to
              share information and to establish research and communication networks for the
              future. This Award was jointly supported by the Metabolic Biochemistry and the
              Microbial Genetics Programs, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
