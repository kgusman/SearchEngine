Abstract    :
              Macosko - Abstract - 9527940      Immiscible polymer-polymer blends are a
              growing part of the polymer industry.  They can offer synergistic properties,
              the best features of both components.  They also provide a means for the
              recycling of mixed polymer waste.  Because the component polymers are
              immiscible, their blends must by stabilized against coalescence.  To obtain the
              desired properties, the minor component must by well dispersed and its size and
              shape controlled, typically at the submicron scale.  To achieve this dispersion
              level, blends are usually prepared in a twin screw extruder and block or graft
              copolymers are added to compatibilize the blend, i.e. to aid in dispersion and
              prevent coalescence.  These copolymers are expected to reside in the interface
              between the two components also aiding mechanical adhesion.  There are two ways
              to add copolymers to a blend:  (1) Synthesize the block copolymers in a
              separate step and then add it with the other components during blending; and
              (2) Create the block or graft copolymer in situ, ruing the blending process by
              coupling reactions across the interface between the components.  In this
              project, several strategies for making pre-made copolymers more effective are
              explored.      The objectives of the research program are:  1. Develop a model
              for morphology generation during polymer melt blending that accounts for
              interfacial stabilization via reactive coupling.    2. Establish the
              competitive advantage to reactive blending versus addition of pre-made block
              copolymer.    3. Apply results of 1 and 2 to isotactic polypropylene.    4.
              Evaluate the effects of optimized two-phase morphology on mechanical
              properties.  5. Establish viable means of producing functional polymers in
              usable quantities.  6. Quantify the role of interfacial thickness and reaction
              kinetics on the efficiency of reactive blending.
