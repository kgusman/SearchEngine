Abstract    :
              9527263   Rose  Debris flows are hazardous when they occur.  In the past such
              events have destroyed and damaged property and killed tens of thousands of
              people.  This study will seek to improve the understanding of debris flows and
              hyperconcentrated flows through experiments, theoretical and modeling efforts,
              and study of deposits from experiments.  This proposal is a part of a larger
              study plan consisting of three major parts:  1) small scale laboratory
              experiments in flumes 1 to 8 m long and 5 to 30 cm wide at McGill University;
              2) large scale experiments in a flume 2 m wide and 95 m long at the U.S.
              Geological Survey flume in Oregon; 3) a field study of noncohesive debris-flow
              deposits.  This proposal seeks funding for parts 1 and 2 of the plan.  Part 1,
              small scale laboratory experiments, is supported, in part, by a Canada
              International Fellowship to the principal investigator from the National
              Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.  Experiments in small
              flumes have the advantage that setting up and finishing a large matrix of
              experiments in a short time is feasible and that steady uniform flow is easily
              attained, but they are drastically scaled down from the natural processes that
              they are meant to stimulate.  In small flumes, data can more easily be
              collected, but some of the conclusions drawn from it may be suspect because of
              the difficulty in scaling large flows, especially those that contain large
              proportions of gravel sized debris.  It is therefore critical to perform
              experiments in a large apparatus to determine the effects of scaling and to
              reproduce natural flow conditions and deposits more accurately.
