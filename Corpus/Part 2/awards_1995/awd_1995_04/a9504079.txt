Abstract    :
              Sonar is an attractive sensing modality for robotics because it is  relatively
              simple to implement and process, has low cost and energy  consumption, can be
              used in conjunction with camera vision, and for  some applications it is the
              only practical sensing modality. This  research investigates a form of adaptive
              sonar sensing, in which  the sensor changes its physical configuration during
              the sensing  process in reaction to the observed echoes.  This approach, 
              analogous to some approaches to active computer vision,  is  motivated by
              biological systems that turn their ears toward the  direction of the sound
              source and move to observe an object from  different directions. As part of
              this research, signal processing  algorithms are investigated to develop a
              sensing system that can  identify objects by their acoustic signatures. The
              current model of  echo production is extended to predict the echoes observed by
              the  sonar system. The sonar allows the robot to navigate around an 
              unstructured environment precisely and to construct accurate sonar  maps by
              using environmental objects as naturally-occurring beacons.   This approach
              should support more autonomous and flexible operation  of both mobile robots
              and robot arms, thus improving their  functionality in manufacturing
              applications.
