Abstract    :
              DMS-9504122 Avellaneda  This project covers two areas of current  interest in
              Applied Mathematics. The first part concerns problems  in pattern formation
              arising from hyperbolic conservation laws  with random initial data. The
              statistical properties of  solutions, their probability distribution functions
              and the  complex patterns will be analyzed from a mathematical standpoint. 
              These problems arise in various settings in Statistical Physics,  in turbulence
              modeling and in Cosmology. The second part of this  project is concerned with
              the mathematical modeling of advanced  composite materials with piezoelectric
              constituents.   The  mathematical methods that will be brought to bear on these
               problems include asymptotics for partial differential equations,  including
              homogenization theory, probability and numerical  modeling.Polymer/piezoceramic
              composites are ideal materials to  construct high-performance sensors and
              actuators that can be used  in a variety of industrial and medical
              applications.
