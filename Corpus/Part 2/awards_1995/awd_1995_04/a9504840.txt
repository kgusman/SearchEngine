Abstract    :
              9504840  Kompala  This  project  is on research to characterize the  dependence 
              of  foreign  gene  expression  on  cell cycle  phase  of  recombinant 
              mammalian  cells, and to exploit this dependency  for  maximizing  the
              production of heterologous glycoproteins in high cell density  perfusion 
              bioreactors.   The  three  major  objectives  of   the  proposed  research are:
              (1) to investigate the  hypothesized  key  role  of  promoters in determining
              the cell cycle phase in  which  the foreign proteins are expressed in
              recombinant Chinese Hamster  Ovary  (CHO)  cells  by  using the two-parameter 
              flow  cytometic  analysis,   and  to  identify  and  characterize  a   strong  
              G1  phase-specific promoter for maximizing foreign protein expression  at  low
              growth rates; (2) to investigate whether the two opposing  trends  in the
              relationship between the specific production  rate  and  the  cell  growth  in 
              continuous  suspension  cultures   of  recombinant  CHO cultures are caused by
              G1- and S-phase  specific  expression from the upstream promoters, and to
              exploit  a  strong  G1  phase  specific  promoter to maximize  the  production 
              of  a  secreted  foreign protein in perfusion bioreactors with  attached 
              inclined  settlers;  and (3) to investigate whether  the  smaller  dying 
              apoptotic cells can be removed before their  intracellular  glycosidases and
              proteases are released into the medium.  ***
