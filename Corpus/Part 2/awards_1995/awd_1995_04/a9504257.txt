Abstract    :
              9504257  Cavanaugh   Studies of stable isotopes allow valuable insight into 
              various aspects of carbon cycling.   For example, such  stable carbon isotope
              data have been used to lend support to  the putative dependence of several
              hydrothermal vent animals  on organic matter produced by chemosynthetic
              endosymbionts.  Unfortunately the observed isotope fractionations in various 
              ecosystems have not always been readily understood, leading  to equivocal
              conclusions regarding tropic relations between  species in a given ecosystem. 
              Again, the hydrothermal vent  ecosystems provide an example of this.   del13C
              values  measured for symbiotic bivalves (del13C = -27% to -35%)  mimic those of
              free-living chemoautotrophs, indicating the  symbionts' nutritional role.  In
              contrast, the food sources  are less clear for tubeworm-chemoautotroph
              symbioses since  these tissues exhibit surprisingly heavy stable isotope 
              values (del13Cs = -9 to  -35%).   While a number of theories  have been
              presented, the heavier isotope values for the  symbioses have never been
              adequately explained.   The  recognition of different Rubisco forms being
              expressed may  have far reaching implications, beyond interpretations of 
              carbon cycling at hydrothermal vent ecosystems.   The recent  discovery of a
              form II Rubisco in a dinoflagellate indicates  that this enzyme is not confined
              to the bacterial  autotrophs, and may well explain the isotopically heavy 
              del13C values of organic matter recovered from the open  ocean.   Accurately
              resolving the effects of various forms  of the carbon fixation enzyme, Rubisco,
              may have a  tremendous impact on interpretation of del13C data in  ecological
              and paleontological studies.  ***
