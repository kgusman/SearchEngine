Abstract    :
              9504299  Vilonen       The investigator will work on the following subjects, to
              a large   extent using topological methods: representation theory of Lie
              groups,   representation theory of algebraic groups, automorphic sheaves and
              the   geometric Langlands conjecture, and perverse sheaves and micro-local  
              perverse sheaves.  The goal is to develop further the geometric   techniques
              that he used with Schmid in solving the Barbasch-Vogan   conjecture on the one
              hand and on the other hand the techniques in his   joint work with Mirkovic on
              modular and integral representations of   algebraic groups.       One typical
              type of a problem in mathematics is to discover and   understand connections
              beteen things that from the outset seem unrelated.    One of the deepest and
              most mysterious types of such connections has been   suggested by Langlands and
              is now generally called a Langlands   correspondence.  A main feature of the
              investigator's work is to   develop geometric techniques to discover and
              establish such connections.  The situation is indeed the most interesting when
              the two things to be   related are not geometric but the connection between
              them is established   by geometry.  This is the nature of the investigator's
              joint work with   Schmid that proved the Barbasch-Vogan conjecture.  His other
              work   involves the Langlands correspondence alluded to above.  In his work
              with   Mirkovic he managed to get quite far in understanding one aspect of  
              Langlands duality by developing new geometric techniques.    ***
