                   Psychology, Including Use of a Shared  Computer Laboratory   Facility     
                   Although psychology is an empirical discipline, there are too  few
              opportunities for psychology majors at West Chester   University to obtain
              direct, hands-on experience with psychological  principles.  The proposed
              project will implement a laboratory  component in each of four core courses
              within experimental  psychology.  Development of laboratory courses is
              underway, and  inauguration of the new courses will coincide with the
              department's  acquisition of a newly renovated building.  NSF support is 
              requested for equipping a shared computer laboratory,with  appropriate
              instructional software,and acquiring some of the basic  equipment for
              establishing these teaching laboratories.  This  equipment includes one rack of
              cage housing for laboratory rats, an  operant conditioning apparatus, and a
              general purpose video  tracking system.  The shared computer laboratory would
              consist of  25 student workstations and an instructor's station (which will act
               as file server for a peer-to-peer local network within the  laboratory),
              capable of projecting video or computer images for  viewing by the entire
              class.  Group data collection, data analysis,  and tutorials are facilitated by
              the video projection system.  The  shared computer laboratory would also serve
              as a re.source for  independent student research and other courses, including 
              statistics, research design, and cognitive psychology.
