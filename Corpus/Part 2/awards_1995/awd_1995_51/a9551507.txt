Abstract    :
              The summer field course is the single most important  undergraduate geology
              course because it unifies all the diverse  aspects of the science.   Unlike
              other parts of a geology  curriculum, the field course in most colleges has
              remained  unchanged dor several decades.   This project adds a new  dimension
              to traditional field training by integrating it with  several new
              computer-based technologies that are currently  revolutionizing the earth
              sciences.   Through the use of  Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global
              Positioning  Satellites (GPS), computer mapping, and 3-D visualization, the 
              new field course teaches students how these technologies can be  utilized to
              improve their ability to handle the increasingly  difficult task of dealing
              with the large and diverse data sets  needed to solve today's complex problems.
                When the new  technologies are used in a classical field course, the 
              traditional emphasis on data collection can be shifted to data  synthesis and
              interpretation.   Students' critical thinking  skills can only be enhanced by
              such a change.   Formulation and  testing of hypotheses based upon field data
              are a cornerstone of  the new curriculum.   As a result, students can be better
               prepared for the interdisciplinary role that today's geologist  must play in
              dealing with complex problems.
