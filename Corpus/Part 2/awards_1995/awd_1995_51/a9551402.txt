                              Interdisciplinary    Title: Improvement of a Science Teaching
              Center for Pre-Service     Teachers           Science instruction at the
              secondary level must change if we  expect to improve the level of science
              literacy in the U.S.  Many  students now age 13 will be the consumers of
              science-based  technological advancements in the year 2061 and beyond!  
              Furthermore, a science teacher who graduates in 1995 may not retire  until the
              year 2030.  With this in mind, it is essential that  pre-service teachers learn
              to use the most current classroom  technology.  This project is the upgrading
              of the Science Teaching  Center (STC).           The courses which use this
              laboratory emphasize hands-on  activities in a laboratory of 15 computers and
              other demonstration  equipment.  Faculty work with pre-service science
              education majors  to better prepare them for entry into the modern science
              classroom.   Three courses (SED 307, SED 308, and seminars for SED 408) are 
              targeted in this proposal.           Each of four activity centers in the STC
              are being furnished  with two networked computers.  Five computers are being
              placed in  the student work area, and two computers are being placed in the 
              curriculum library.  Data collected by the pre-service students is  stored and
              displayed on the networked computers.  These data are  the basis for increasing
              the students' understanding of science  concepts and how to teach these
              concepts to students in grades  7-12.  The STC is also being furnished with
              computer accessories  (i.e., transparency adaptor, MacHandwriter pen input pad,
              color  scanner, color printer, and nView LCD projector), commonly found in 
              secondary schools.           Project evalu ation includes usage of the
              facility, student  surveys of student perception of the impact on their
              learning and  preparation for teaching, and follow-ups of the students in their
               field and teaching experiences.  The outcome of this project will  be
              disseminated through presentations at professional meetings and  in educational
              journals.
