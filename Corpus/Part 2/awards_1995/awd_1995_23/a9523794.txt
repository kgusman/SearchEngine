Abstract    :
              9523794  Suuberg    The objective of this project is to conduct fundamental
              research  on a pyrolysis process that can be used to convert scrap tires  into
              activated carbon.  The research involves establishment of  optimum temperature,
              pressure and gaseous environmental  conditions that are necessary to produce
              carbon that has porosity  characteristics that permit its use in adsorption
              processes such  as devices to remove pollutants from water and air.  Chars 
              produced will be evaluated for their adsorption behavior relative  to
              significant classes of adsorbates potentially present in  water, wastewater and
              in gaseous products of combustion such as  organic substances, nitrogen oxides
              and mercury.    The results of the experimental work will be used in
              formulation  of models that can be used in engineering design of processes for 
              converting waste carbonaceous materials into "activated carbon,"  a useful form
              of carbon for removing pollutants from water,  wastewater and gaseous products
              of combustion.  The investigator  plans to collaborate with personnel of
              Advanced Fuel Research,  Inc., a firm that conducted research under NSF Grant
              No. 92-15045  on the feasibility of using discarded vehicle tires for producing
               marketable forms of carbon.
