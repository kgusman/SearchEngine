Abstract    :
              This project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic 
              Chemistry Program will support the continuation of studies of transition  
              metal polymerization catalysts by Professor J.  Boncella of the   University of
              Florida.  Studies of transition metal complexes of   polydentate, polyanionic
              ligands will be undertaken with the following   objectives: 1) continued
              development of catalysts for olefin metathesis   polymerization and
              depolymerization with emphasis on the mechanism of   action of a recently
              developed tungsten-based catalyst of  
              N,N'-bis(trimethylsilyl)-o-phenylenediamide, 2) possible applications for  C-H
              bond activation reactions that are observed  with this tungsten   compound, 3)
              development of catalysts that will perform both metathesis   polymerization and
              Zeigler-Natta type polymerizations at the same metal   center, and 4) the
              synthesis of a new class of polyanionic ligands based   upon the pyrrolide
              ligand, including some that carry more charge than   ligating atoms.  This new
              class of ligands is expected to lead to the   synthesis of high oxidation state
              early transition metal complexes that   have unusually low coordination numbers
              and which may have enhanced   reactivity.  The properties of transition metal
              catalysts are critically dependent   upon the type and number of groups
              (ligands) that are attached to the   active metal center.  This project
              involves the synthesis and study of   several new catalysts.  Among objectives
              of this research are 1) the   development of new types of polymerization
              catalysts that are thermally   robust and allow for the polymerization of
              monomers that cannot currently   be polymerized because  of catalyst
              instability, and 2) the development of dual function   catalysts that can be
              used to co-polymerize two monomers that undergo   polymerization by different
              mechanisms.
