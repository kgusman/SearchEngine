              Abstract  ATM-9523237  Thompson, Lonnie G.  Ohio State University  Title: A
              Cooperative Ice Core Paleoclimate Study of Monsoon                Variability
              as Archived in the Dasuopu Glacier, China    This award supports the retrieval
              and analysis of ice cores from  the tropical Dasuopu glacier located in the
              south central Himalayas  where conventional, long-term climatic data are
              completely absent.   Tropical records are of particular interest as 50% of the
              global  surface lies between 30oN and 30oS and 75% of the Earth's population 
              inhabits these climatically tropical lands.  The records from these  cores will
              complement the long histories recovered from Dunde and  Guliya ice caps, on the
              northeastern and northwestern margins of  the Qinghai-Tibetan (Q-T) Plateau. 
              Located on the southern margin  of the Q-T Plateau the new drilling site lies
              well within the  spatial extent of the monsoon system.  Dominance of monsoonal 
              circulation produces distinctly annual cycles in oxygen isotopic  ratios and in
              the deposition of visible dust which permit the  reconstruction of high
              resolution (annual) records of climatic and  environmental conditions.  Dasuopu
              is located just north of the  Himalayas with annual precipitation about 300 mm
              water equivalent  (H2O eq.).  The high elevation of this site ensures that ice 
              temperatures will be well below OoC, hence this glacier may be  "polar: in
              character and is likely to contain a long, well-  preserved record.  The
              initial field program includes a complement  of geophysical and surface studies
              designed to determine the  suitability of this glacier for the recovery of high
              resolution,  well-preserved ice core records.  Studies of the climate of China 
              are plagued by the absence of data from major sections of the (Q-T)  Plateau
              and the surrounding high mountain ranges.  The successful  retrieval of
              previous records (Dunde and Guliya) suggest that ice  cores from carefully
              selected ice caps in Asia are excellent  archives for climatic and
              environmental histories.   These records  are essential to fill one of the
              major spatial gaps in the Earth's  climate history.
