Abstract    :
              This research project will analyze the role and nature of business and strategic
              planning in driving  the effective implementation and continuing development of
              Total Quality Management (TQM).  The study  will characterize effective
              planning processes, identify barriers to implementation and other areas  which
              cause difficulty, and examine the way in which planning systems evolve in
              conjunction with the  development of a TQM system.   An important aspect of the
              research will be the examination of  processes for resource allocation in
              conjunction with the planning process; in particular, researchers  will
              investigate the way in which difficult-to-measure costs are incorporated into
              the decision-making  process.  A key goal of the research will be to improve
              the integration of business planning and  quality systems planning.  The
              research methods involve in-depth and on-site assessments of the  planning
              systems of organizations in varying stages of development of their TQM systems.
               Interviews  with employees at all levels and review of company documentation
              will be the primary data sources;  survey methods may be used as a supplement. 
              Companies participating in the study include AT&T  Transmission Systems, First
              Chicago Bank, and Hewlett Packard.
