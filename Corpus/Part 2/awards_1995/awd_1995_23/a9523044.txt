Abstract    :
              9523044  Bigio   This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
              project will provide the analysis and modeling support to design an innovative
              new injection molding machine.  Conceptual design and theoretical analysis
              indicate that it is possible to eliminate a step in going from several virgin
              homopolymer stock to a final molded product made from a blended polymer.  The
              current practice is to use extrusion to blend several polymers in an
              intermediate step, and the extruded blend is used for feed stock for an
              injection molding machine.  There is often waste at this intermediate step. 
              The proposed approach will do the blending and mixing on the injection molding
              machine, using a single stage non-intermeshing twin screw injection molding
              machine.  The twin screw is the innovation, because while one of the screws
              rotates, it moves axially relative to the other.  This makes it possible to
              close the control  loop to maintain both blend and molding outputs.  A
              prototype machine will be designed and built by Engel Injection Molding Machine
              Company, the University of Maryland's industrial partner.  Modeling and
              experimentation will be used to determine the operating protocol for the
              multivariate problem of controlling blending and molding with the new twin
              screw design.  A factorial designed experiment using this novel machine concept
              will be used to evaluate the functional performance of glass fiber blended with
              polypropylene and nylon.       The impact of this project is elimination of a
              processing step and the attendant recycle stream, and the real time control of
              the blended stock and the molded product at the molding machine.  With better
              local blend control, more recycled stock can be used in molded products.
