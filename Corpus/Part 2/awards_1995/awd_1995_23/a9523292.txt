Abstract    :
               DMS-9523292 Bruno  The mathematical investigations associated with this
              proposal relate to the classical theory of Partial Differential Equations and
              its applications to the study of the physical properties of materials and
              media; they constitute a natural continuation of my research of the last five
              years. By using methods of homogenization, integral equations, spectral
              analysis and regularity together with computational techniques I intend
              mathematical techniques will be developed to study and predict the physical
              properties of composite materials, shape memory materials and plasmas, as well
              as the scattering of electromagnetic radiation by general obstacles.   In the
              area of electromagnetism some computational methods are introduced recently to
              new areas, including remote sensing of obstacles as well as the mathematically
              related problem of detection of damaged biological tissue (perhaps cancer) by
              means of electromagnetic scattering. In its previous applications these methods
              were highly successful; These methods will be used to deal with shape memory
              alloys. These materials can be used in a variety of applications (including
              generation of electricity from low temperature sources, medical devices, etc.)
              by exploiting their ability to recover their shape, after they have been
              deformed, by means of appropriate changes in their temperature.
