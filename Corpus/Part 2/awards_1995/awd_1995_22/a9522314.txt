Abstract    :
              9522314    The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve (Wells NERR)  is part
              of a national system created to promote and support  estuarine research.  It is
              the sole on-site research  facility for the study of marsh dominated estuarine 
              ecosystems on the Gulf of Marine coast, and its site  encompasses estuarine
              ecosystems of such systems from Cape  Cod to Maine's mid-coast.  It contains
              one of the few  undeveloped barrier beaches in Maine and two marsh dominated 
              estuaries, one nearly pristine, the other in use as a harbor  and surrounded by
              development.  The Reserve has a Research  Program that is growing to meet the
              pressing need for  estuarine research in the Gulf of Maine region.    The Wells
              NERR is a partnership between governmental and  private entities.  A unique
              feature of the NERR program is  that research and resource management work
              together, so that  new research findings will be used to guide management of 
              coastal resources.  The Wells NERR has fulfilled many of the  research
              objectives set out in its first Management  Plan,  which was approved in 1990. 
              It is beginning to work on a  major revision of its Management Plan this year. 
              The  Research Program is cooperating with this effort.  The  research director
              will work with an independent panel of  scientist, herein called the Research
              Planning and Review  Committee, to review and develop the long-term goals of
              the  program and formulate achievable objectives for the next  five years,
              including establishment of a university  affiliation.    After the planning
              activities and conference are completed,  the Wells NERR will make the
              necessary changes that will  allow it to establish its place in the research
              community  and meet the demand for ecological research focused on marsh 
              dominated estuaries in the Gulf of Maine.
