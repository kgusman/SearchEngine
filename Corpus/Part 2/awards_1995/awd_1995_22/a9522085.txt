Abstract    :
              9521673 Lewis  This project will investigate investigate neural network,  (NN),
              for control of nonlinear dynamical systems.  Its objective is to provide a
              framework for repeatable design of stable NN controllers for large classes of
              nonlinear systems.  It will use nonlinear stability theory  (e.g. input -output
              stability and passivity notions introduced in the 60's by one of the PIs) to
              study  approximation properties of NN, with emphasis on guaranteeing NN
              controller performance in terms of small  tracking errors and bounded NN
              weights (implying bounded inputs).  Re eatable design algorithms will be given
              for NN controllers.  Without guaranteed for performance  and sensible design
              algorithms, NN controller s will rightfully not be accepted bye the control
              system community or US industry.  NN controllers have the potential to
              significantly improve manufacturing process control in the US, since they are
              model-free and do not require explicit dynamics of the plant.  The UTA work
              will be done at the Automation and robotics Research Institute (ARRI), so that
              technology transfer to industry will occur.  The NN controllers developed will
              be implemented on the Flexibly-Link Systems Testbed, and then installed on the
              Manufacturing Surface Finishing Station.  The ARRI Surface Finishing Consortium
              has offered matching money to finance the extensive technical work needed for
              this industrial application.  ARRI Manager J. M. Fitzgerald, PE, and Dr. Kai
              Liu will be  assigned on a matching fund basis to supervise this project,
