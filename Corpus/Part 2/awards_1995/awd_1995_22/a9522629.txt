Abstract    :
              9522629  Yates  The Construction Decision Support System for Delay Analysis (DAS
               - Delay Analysis System) for use on personal computers was  developed to
              integrate existing project control systems and  scheduling programs by adding
              the capability of determining  possible causes for delays and suggesting
              alternative courses of  action to prevent further delays.    The DAS was
              designed to demonstrate the importance of providing  an interactive environment
              for knowledge acquisition to improve  project controls and analysis processes. 
              The development of the  interactive system enhances information processing and
              decision-  making capabilities.  The ability to monitor the progress of a 
              project, and to determine possible causes of delays and suggest  corrective
              actions with the aid of a personal computer provides  consistent evaluation of
              project performance.    The objective of the second phase of the DAS research
              is to  include additional knowledge bases related to contract and  project
              parameters such as different types of projects, different  locations of
              projects, and different types of firms to increase  its usefulness to the
              diverse segments of the construction  industry.  The data collected will be
              analyzed using hypothesis  testing to determine whether there are correlations
              between the  different parameters and types of delays.  The results of this 
              analysis will be used to refine the DA system submodels.    Additional research
              objectives include conducting research in the  area of international delays,
              including cultural factors, and  creating new submodels that will contain
              knowledge on delays  related to international construction.  Research will also
              be  conducted in to resolution upon completion of construction  projects.  ***
