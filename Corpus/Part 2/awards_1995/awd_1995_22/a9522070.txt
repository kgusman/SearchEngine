Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
              Department of Chemistry  at the University of Minnesota acquire upgrades for
              three existing liquids NMR spectrometers that will  be used in research
              investigations in the following areas of chemistry:  organic chemistry (natural
               products synthesis, development of synthetic methodology, drug design, and
              chiral catalysts), inorganic  chemistry (organometallic chemistry, metal
              clusters, and bioinorganic chemistry), and biological  chemistry (oligopeptide
              structure, methods for oligosaccharide sequencing, metalloprotein structure,
              and  protein-DNA/RNA interactions).    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the 
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific  arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules  in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out  frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas
              such as polymers and catalysis,  and in biology.
