Abstract    :
              Abstract  9522597  Shaw    Funds are provided to the State University of New
              York -  Buffalo in the Support of 7th US/Japan Workshop on High-  Temperature
              Superconductivity (HTS) during October 23-27,  1995. The objectives of the
              Workshop are: 1) to bring  together specialists from both countries in the
              development  of HTS; 2) to visit R&D laboratories to gain an  understanding of
              the level of equipment and personnel  support in HTS; and 3) identify the
              problem areas that are  particularly suited for international cooperative
              programs  to further the progress of HTS. The workshop will be held at  the
              National Research Institute on Metals in Tsukaba, Japan  on October 23-24th.
              The technical tour consists of three  visits to key research centers/labs
              during October 25-27th.  This is the second Workshop in Japan. The previous one
              was  held in Houston.  %%%  This workshop is organized to address research
              issues that  will advance progress in five technical areas related to  national
              needs:  1. tapes and coils, and their applications;  2. bulk materials and
              applications; 3.  thin-films and new  materials; 4.  vortex structure and
              critical currents; 5.  theory and characterization.
