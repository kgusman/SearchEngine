Abstract    :
              9522756  Abernathy  In electronics applications, narrow budget and/or high
              doping levels are usually needed in order to minimize the resistances arising
              from Ohmic contacts.  Similar contact schemes must be developed for
              nitride-based p-n junction devices.  In addition to a low contact resistance it
              is especially important that the contracts be thermally stable as the devices
              will often have to operate in a high temperature environment.  The first
              objective of this proposal is to fabricate stable non-alloyed Ohmic contacts on
              both n-type GaN and graded n-InxGa1-xN/n-GaN layers to determine the contact
              resistance as deposited over a wide range of measurement temperatures and drive
              current densities.  Next, Ohmic contacts on structures containing an additional
              graded layer of InASyN1-y on top of the graded   InxGa1-x N will be fabricated
              to determine what improvement if any these contacts show at room and elevated
              temperatures.  Contact resistances as a function of measurement temperature for
              Ti/Pt/Au, Pd/Ge or Si sometimes deposited as a single crystal/Ti/Pt, W, and
              possibly other metallization schemes will be measured using  the transmission
              line method (TLM) over the range of 230C to 5000C at current densities ranging
              from 103  A.cm-2.  For all of these structures, extensive characterization of
              the  metal-semiconductor interface will be carried out using Auger Electron
              Spectroscopy (AES) to determine the degree of interdiffusion and transmission
              electron microscopy (TEM) to evaluate the structural integrity of the
              semiconductor/contact.  This information will be used to determine the failure
              models of these structures to provide insight into methods for improvement and
              a more in depth understanding of  how Ohmic contact is formed.    Contacts to
              p-type GaN will be investigated as well.  Using non-alloyed contacts to p-GaN
              as a baseline, structures containing heavily carbon doped GaASyN1-y contact
              layers will be fabricated and compared.  As discussed above, contact
              performance and integrity will  be measured over a wide range of ambient
              temperatures.    In this program, the University of Florida will supply the
              epitaxial used for Ohmic contact information, while EPSD will provide contact
              processing and testing.  ***
