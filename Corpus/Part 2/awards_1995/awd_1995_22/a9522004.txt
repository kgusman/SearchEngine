Abstract    :
              9522004  Church    Pb isotopes will be used as tracers to quantify the
              atmospheric  inputs to and biogeochemical processes in the surface waters of
              the  Sargasso Sea off Bermuda, and data will be gathered in the South  Atlantic
              as part of a proposed third IOC trace element cruise  during the same period.
              This is a coordinated effort between the  University of Delaware Principal
              Investigators and other  institutions. Included are those currently active in
              studies of the  Bermuda atmosphere as part of the AEROCE program in its third
              phase  with support from NSF-ATM, and other scientists investigating the  major
              nutrient cycles, productivity, and associated carbon based  flux (JGOFS-BATS
              and associated activities) in the waters off  Bermuda under NSF-OCE support. 
              Existing archived samples of  precipitation and oceanic flux particles will be
              utilized first if  they satisfy clean collection criteria.  The proposed study
              will  focus on the element Pb and its isotope tracers which include  stable Pb
              (204,206,207,208), and the radioactive nuclide 210Pb with  the associated
              parent/daughter pairs which are part of the series  226 Ra, 222Rn,  210Bi, and
              210Po.  Lead and its isotopes will be  measured in individual and integrated
              atmospheric samples to be  taken at the AEROCE Bermuda site, and on board
              several cruises off  Bermuda. The radioactive lead (210Pb) and its
              disequilibrium with  the daughters 210Bi and 210Po will reveal of atmospheric
              and  surface ocean scavenging.  The half lives of these isotopes (5 and  138
              days respectively) should be commensurate with processes such  as aqueous
              scavenging of particle reactive elements (such as Bi),  and bio-active elements
              (such as Po).  Through modeling of  dissolved 210 Po profiles in the surface
              mixed layer down to the  thermocline, eddy diffusion co-efficients in the
              surface waters  will be determined and subsequently used to place constraints
              on  new production rates.  Generally, lead isotope modeling will  constrain
              vertical and horizontal contribution s to the surface  waters, and calibrate
              the mixing and particle scavenging of Pb.
