Abstract    :
              9522534  Simpson                                   When one kidney or part of a
              kidney is surgically removed or becomes  dysfunctional, the mass of the
              remaining kidney increases in a compensatory manner to maintain normal or near
              normal renal function.  The processes that regulate the compensatory changes
              are not understood.  In this proposal, Dr. Simpson puts forth the hypothesis
              that compensatory growth is the result of the inhibition of a organ-specific
              factor in the blood that normally suppresses tissue growth.  Thus, when this
              factor is inhibited, specific tissues begin to proliferate.  The growth is
              typified by an increased rate of cell division.  He suggests that the
              suppressant material is produced by the organ (kidney in this case) itself to
              prevent over growth.  Removal or loss of an organ reduces the plasma
              concentration of the suppressant and consequently permits cell growth.  He will
              test this hypothesis by infusing plasma from a normal animal into one where two
              thirds of the kidney has been removed.  This should prevent cell growth.  Cell
              growth (division) will be tracked by DNA synthesis (incorporation of
              3H-thymidine) 24 hours after the infusion of donor plasma.  These experiments
              have the potential of providing valuable insights into normal and abnormal cell
              growth an regulation.  ***
