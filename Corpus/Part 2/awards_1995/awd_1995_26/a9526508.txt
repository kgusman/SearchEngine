Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program will support Charles S.   Parmenter
              of Indiana University in Bloomington to continue his studies of  
              state-resolved energy transfer in various molecules.  The gist of his  
              experiment is to use a supersonic molecular beam technique to generate  
              molecules in a few, very specific rotational states.  Laser pumping is   then
              used to excite the molecule to the first singlet electronic excited   state,
              and dispersed fluorescence detection of states populated by   inelastic
              scattering yields relative cross sections for single collision   energy
              transfer channels.   Past efforts involved scattering of glyoxal   (12
              vibrational modes) from rare gases or diatomic molecules.  During   this
              funding period, the investigator will extend his studies on glyoxal   to
              collisions with helium or diatomic hydrogen.  He will also study   relative
              cross sections as a function of center-of-mass energy between   collision
              partners.   Finally, the crossed beam experiments will be   extended to
              deuterated formaldehyde, a molecular system far different   from glyoxal due to
              its nonplanar excited electronic state, presence of a   dipole moment and
              extreme anharmonicity in an active vibrational mode.    The research is
              directed at the problem of vibrational and rotational   energy flow within
              polyatomic molecules.  This is central to the problem   of how molecules
              acquire the activation energy needed for reactions.  The   collision-free
              vibrational energy flow is a fundamental aspect of   dissociation or
              isomerization of molecules with high vibrational   excitation.
