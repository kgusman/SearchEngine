Abstract    :
              This research focuses on developing the scientific foundation and implementing
              practical tools for optimizing and synthesizing rule-based expert systems to
              meet specified response time constraints.  Real-time rule-based expert systems
              are embedded artificial intelligence systems increasingly used in
              safety-critical applications such as airplane avionics, medical monitoring
              instruments, smart robots, and space vehicles.  In addition to functional
              correctness, these systems must also satisfy  stringent timing constraints. 
              The result of missing a deadline in these systems may be catastrophic.  If a
              given rule-based system cannot deliver an adequate performance in bounded time,
              then it has to be optimized or resynthesized.  The first part of the project
              investigates several approaches (state-space-based and semantics-based) for
              optimizing the rule base of expert systems.  The second part of the project
              investigates the optimization of the match phase, which has a highly
              unpredictable runtime.  The development of a systematic methodology to tackle
              the optimization problem opens up new avenues to further enhance the runtime
              performance of rule-based systems in time-critical environments.  This
              technology will play a key role in tomorrow's complex information and computing
              systems such as multimedia tools, virtual reality systems, smart robots, and
              high-bandwidth networks, where an intelligent interface is essential and time
              becomes an increasingly critical resource.
