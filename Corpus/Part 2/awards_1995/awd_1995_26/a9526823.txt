              understood aspects of the Alleghanian orogeny in the southern Appalachians is
              the origin of the granitic magmas that accompanied orogensis.  Determining the
              tectonic setting of the granites is directly linked to our understanding of the
              tectonic evolution of eastern Laurentia during late Paleozoic time.  Various
              models have been proposed to explain the origin and tectonic setting of the
              Alleghanian plutons, including their formation in a west dipping subduction
              system, generation by lithospheric delamination, generation by thermal
              blanketing, and formation in a transpressional regime by crustal arching.  The
              wide variation in these models reflects the lack of a coherent geochemical data
              base for the plutons and a paucity a high precision crystallization ages for
              the granites.  Recent work has produced a large chemical and isotopic data set
              for the Alleghanian granites that places significant new constraints on likely
              source regions.  However, the current lack of precise ages of the granites
              limits our ability to detect temporal trends in the geochemical data, constra
              in the tectonic setting of the granites, and to decipher the nature of the
              unexposed portions of Appalachian terranes.  This study will determine
              crystallization ages of Alleghanian plutons from all of the major southern
              Appalachian lithotectonic belts by using high-precision U-Pb zircon and
              monazite geochronologic technique.  The goals of the study are to (1) determine
              the initiation and duration of Alleghanian magmagenesis; (2) determine whether
              temporal geochemical trends exist (3) determine further the nature of unexposed
              Appalachian crust by dating zircon xenocrysts; and (4) constrain the timing of
              deformation events in selected terranes by dating pre-, syn- and post-tectonic
              plutons.                          ;
