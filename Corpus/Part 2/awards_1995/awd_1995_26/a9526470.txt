               The eastern margin of Baja California is an example of a continental margin
              that has experienced young (Plio-Quaternary) oblique rifting which appears to
              have overprinted, slightly order orthogonal rifting.  This style of deformation
              may lead to formation of detached continental blocks that then travel parallel
              to the margin, eventually becoming  allochthonous terranes  attached or
              reattached to continental margins far from their point of origin.  The goals of
              this collaborative project to test the hypothesis that orthogonal rifting was
              overprinted by oblique rifting, to document fault interactions, to investigate
              segmentation of structures along the margin and to study the associated land
              forms produced by these tectonic events.  Results should help understand the
              origin of the  Gulf of California and, by analogy, may help understand
              allochthonous terranes.                                            Oh     +'  0
