Abstract    :
              9526862  Johnson    This research involves the acquisition of medium and high- 
              resolution seismic images of the low-angle Santa Rita normal fault,  near
              Tucson, Arizona, to resolve the question of its connection to  shallower,
              steeper, potentially seismogenically active faults  identified at the surface. 
              Focal mechanisms for large (M=6 or  larger) normal-faulting earthquakes in
              extensional terranes suggest  that seismogenic normal faults have dips that
              range from 30 to 70  degrees.  At the same time, geologic relationships suggest
              that  large, low-angle normal faults (dips of less than 30 degrees) may  have
              accommodated large-scale crustal extension.  These disparate  observations are
              often reconciled by arguments that low-angle  faults slip aseismically, or,
              low-angle faults at depth rotate to  high angle at the surface.  This work will
              attempt to provide an  example of the latter argument.  This research is a
              component of  the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.     ***
