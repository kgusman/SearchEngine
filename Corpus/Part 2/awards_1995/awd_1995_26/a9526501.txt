Abstract    :
                    This award provides partial support for the Board on Earth Sciences and
              Resources (BESR) over the next 30 months.  NSF provides approximately 20% of
              the total cost of core support for BESR; additional support is also requested
              from the Department of Energy, Department of Interior, and the National
              Aeronautics and Space Administration.    BESR coordinates the National Research
              CouncilOs advice to the federal government on solid earth science issues.  The
              Board identifies opportunities for advancing basic research, reports on
              applications of earth sciences in such areas as disaster mitigation and
              resource utilization, and analyzes the scientific underpinnings and credibility
              of earth science information for resource, environmental and other applications
              and policy decisions.   The BoardOs actions address the overall health of the
              earth sciences and the education or earth scientists that is vital to
              maintaining and increasing the nationOs capability to make wise use of the
              Earth and its resources.    As enunciated in the BoardOs 1993 report,
              OSolid-Earth Sciences and SocietyO, the challenge to the earth science
              community is to develop an integrate approach to the solid earth and its
              resources.  Worldwide improved living standards and population increases
              combine to pose new problems extending from basic issues of the physics and
              chemistry of the earth to complex considerations of resources, environment, and
              land utilization.  The Board is giving increased emphasis to the impact of
              transition from a field traditionally focused on resource discovery,
              assessment, and extraction to one increasingly dominated by environmental
              concerns.
