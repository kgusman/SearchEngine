              Schwartz  This Americas Program award will support a research collaboration
              between Dr. Susan Schwartz, University of California  Santa Cruz, and Dr.
              Marino Protti, Universidad Nacional , Costa Rica.  They propose to install a
              continuously operating broadband seismic  and space-based geodetic monitoring
              system on Volcan Arenal, an active volcano in north-central Costa Rica.   Their
              goal is to use the data collected to gain a better understanding of volcanic
              processes, such as magma conduit initiation and magma transport, and to
              integrate this knowledge with observations of precursory deformation, leading
              to improvements in volcano eruption forecasting.  Only a few volcanoes
              world-wide are presently being monitored with geodetic instrumentation.  In
              almost all of these, measurements are made too infrequently, or the land-based
              techniques are too imprecise to define the time-varying signal associated with
              volcanic deformation.  The researchers will remove these limitations by
              installing a continuously operating monitoring system .  This information will
              be beneficial not only to the two parti cipating countries, but also  to other
              countries with active volcanoes.  ***
