Abstract    :
              This award supports Joanne Romagni, a Ph.D. student of Professor Thomas Nash at
              Arizona State University, for a ten week period of dissertation enhancement
              research at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany.  She will
              work in the Department of Biogeochemistry with Drs. Franz Meixner and Juergen
              Kesselmeier and members of their research groups.  The specific objectives of
              her research visit are to learn methodologies to measure trace nitrogen gases,
              to gain additional experience with trace sulfur gas analyses, and to construct
              and test gas sampling chambers appropriate for her research on lichens and
              leaves.  This experience will be very useful in her research to quantify
              sources and sinks of nitrogen and sulfur trace gases in a blue oak woodland
              ecosystem in California.  Such information will improve our understanding of
              the biogenic origins of atmospheric trace gases which play a role in climate
              change.  The Max Planck Institute for Chemistry is one of the most respected
              research institutes in the world in the area of atmospheric chemistry and the
              interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere.  The scientists with
              whom Ms. Romagni will work are experts in the study of trace gas fluxes and
              global biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and sulfur.  They have developed new
              and efficient micrometeorological methods to monitor trace nitrogen and sulfur
              gases in vegetation and soils.  Gaining experience with these techniques will
              directly benefit Ms. Romagni's doctoral dissertation research on trace gas
              fluxes in a woodland ecosystem.
