              Barbour. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a family of enzymes which catalyze the
              release of fatty acid from phospholipids in cell membranes.  Mammalian cells
              express several structurally diverse isoforms of PLA2.  As these enzymes
              catalyze the same reaction, one must question the purpose of this redundancy. 
              Furthermore, although many studies have provided indirect evidence that PLA2s
              are important for cell phospholipid metabolism, a lack of specific inhibitors
              has hampered confirmation of these studies.  The goals of this research effort
              are to provide direct evidence for the roles of the PLA2s in cell phospholipid
              metabolism and function, and to determine which isoforms of the enzyme are
              involved in these processes.  Antisense RNA will be used to block the
              expression of each of the three isoforms of PLA2 expressed by the
              macrophage-like cell line P388D1.  Phospholipid composition and phospholipid
              metabolism will be compared in control cells and cells lacking each of the
              PLA2s.  Functional assays will be performed to determine whether cells that
              lack the PLA2s retain the capacity to function as m acrophages.  Together,
              these experiments will directly assess the role of PLA2 in phospholipid
              metabolism and cell function, and provide insight into the need for diverse
              isoforms of the enzyme. %%% Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a family of enzymes
              which break down a specific group of fats called phospholipids. The goal of
              this research is to distinguish the function of the various forms of this
              enzyme in the physiology of cells. This research project involves preparing
              cells which lack specific forms of PLA2.  A mouse cell line, P388D1, was chosen
              for the experiments because these cells express three types of PHA2.  Antisense
              RNA technology will be used to block the synthesis of each of the PHA2s in
              P388D1 cells.  The antisense cells will be used to distinguish the
              physiological roles of different forms of PLA2s. ***                         ;
