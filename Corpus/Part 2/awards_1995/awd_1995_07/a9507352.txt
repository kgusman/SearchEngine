              Campbell A working model for these studies is that assembly of a replication
              fork at a yeast chromosomal origin of replication occurs in multiple stages:
              recognition, unwinding, priming of DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase  alpha
              primase, and recruitment of pol delta and/or pol epsilon. In a complicated,
              multicomponent process such as DNA replication, even the most exhaustive
              characterization of the individual proteins cannot describe the dynamics of the
              actual physiological events. In order to do that, interaction between the
              components, no matter how many there are, must be studied. The experimental
              theme of this project is therefore to design both biochemical and genetic
              experiments to characterize the dynamic interactions between the replication
              proteins, especially the helicases that unwind and the polymerases that form
              the primosome and elongation apparatus. Ultimately we would like to
              reconstitute an unwinding and initiation event at an origin with purified
              proteins. The experiments described  center on DNA helicases. In particular,
              the  P.I. has identified a new yeast DNA replication m utant, dna2, using a
              screen for mutants defective in DNA replication in permeabilized cells. The
              genetic and biochemical experiments proposed will test the mode of involvement
              of the Dna 2 helicase in yeast DNA replication. In particular, the interaction
              of the helicase with the three essential DNA polymerases and the essential
              origin recognition protein, ORC, will be studied. Interestingly, the Dna2
              helicase copurifies with a nuclease whose specificity is similar to the HeLa
              MFl nuclease, that is involved in maturation of Okazaki pieces during lagging
              strand DNA synthesis in the SV40 replication system. A gene encoding a nuclease
              with similar specificity in yeast, called YKL510, suppresses the dna2 mutation
              when present on a high copy number plasmid. This suggests that YKL510 encodes
              the nuclease that is associated with Dna2p il vitro and that YKLS 10 can
              interact with Dna2p in vivo. If the interpretation of these preliminary
              experiments is correct, then they also point to a role for Dna2 helicase in
              replication. A second portion of the proposal will test the hypothesis that the
              nuclease associated with Dna2 is YKLS 10, that they do associate in vivo, and
              that YKLS 10 is involved in processing Okazaki pieces or some other aspect of
              replication in yeast. %% In the past five years there has been a revolution in
              the study of cell biology. Molecular approaches have been possible in
              elucidating the cell cycle, the process by which a new cell arises from a
              parent cell. Fundamental to the cell cycle are two processes; duplication of
              the genome (DNA replication) and segregation of the genome to daughter cells.
              This proposal focuses on DNA replication. The P.I. has discovered a new,
              essential enzyme for this process. Studies of the replication enzyme (the DNA
              helicase) described in this proposal will enhance our understanding of how
              normal cells transmit the genetic information contained in their DNA from one
              generation to the next. ***                                 @
