Abstract    :
                   The errors young children make during the course of language  acquisition
              give researchers strong evidence that grammar is not  learned through pure
              imitation. One error that is a  characteristic of the acquisition of English is
              the pronoun case  error. It is typical for a 2 or 3 year old child to say
              something  like "*Her crashed" when the child apparently means to say "She 
              crashed". These errors are actually a form of overextension, that  is, children
              overextend the use of a pronominal case form, in  this example "her", into the
              syntactic environment of another, in  this example, that of "she". Although
              psycholinguists have known  of these overextensions for a relatively long time,
              only recently  have they proposed testable hypotheses about the nature and 
              causation of these pronoun case overextensions. This research  project tests
              unique predictions of the Pronoun Paradigm Building  Hypothesis of pronoun case
              overextension, and asks three research  questions: (1) Are "he" and "they"
              overextended more often than  "she"?; (2) Do the overextensions of third person
              pronouns  exhibit a positive correlation between bias and rate of 
              overextension?; and, (3) Is "her" overextended more than "him"  and "them"? In
              the study, 30 children between the ages of 30 and  36 months will be audiotaped
              as they interact with their primary  caregivers in three activities designed to
              encourage the use of  third person pronouns: (1) playing with a Little Tikes
              toy set,  (2) the viewing and description of a family photo-album, and (3) 
              reading a picture book. The project will take one year to  complete.
