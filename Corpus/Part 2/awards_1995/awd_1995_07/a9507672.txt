Abstract    :
               This dissertation project involves the research of a cultural anthropology
              student from the University of California-Davis.  The project involves
              ethnographic interviews with a group of mixed-heritage Cherokee Native
              Americans in Oklahoma.  The student will administer a demographic survey to
              about 300 Cherokee tribal members in Tulsa and in Tahlequah, the political
              center of the Cherokee nation.  Then a sample of pictures of mixed-race faces
              blending `white`, `black` and `red` phenotypes, along with brief hypothetical
              biographies will be used as stimuli for in-depth interviews to probe for biases
              and decision rules used by Cherokee to attribute Indian and non-Indian
              identity.  In addition the student will collect oral histories from traditional
              community leaders, study published media about Cherokee identity and relations
              with `mixed-bloods`, and will conduct at least 50 open-ended, in-depth
              interviews with different sub-types of Cherokee identities on mixed heritage
              identity formation.   This research is important because it will clarify the
              issues seen by Native Americans in attributing identity as tribal members.  In
              a society where the national government insists on clear criteria for inclusion
              into Native populations, but where the lived history and genealogy of
              individuals is extremely diverse, the advance in understanding of how different
              types of people use racial and ethnic attributions will be valuable information
              for understanding how and why people react to policies.
