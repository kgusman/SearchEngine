Abstract    :
              9507612  Weil  Among three related alleles of the maize waxy (Wx) gene. each
              caused by a 2 kilobase Ds insertion into precisely the same site, one allele,
              wx-m5:CS7 ((Ds) (CS7), reverts germinally as much as 90 fold less than the
              other two even though all three alleles show the same frequent, somatic
              reversion in the endosperm. The suppression of CS7 germinal reversion is
              genetically linked to Wx, independent of the transposase source and does not
              suppress excision by Ds insertions at other loci, suggesting a cis-acting
              mutation subjecting the CS7 Ds to a novel type of developmental control. The
              overall hypothesis tested in this proposal is that, because of a mutation in
              the CS7 Ds, the host plant can now suppress this transposon by developmentally
              restricting how accessible it is to proper transposase binding. Specifically:
              1. The Ds elements in SD7, CS8, and CS8311B will be sequenced and compared, 2.
              DNA methylation will be compared and the excision rate quantitated at different
              stages during plant development, 3. The interaction of the DS elements will be
              tested by assaying the suppressiol of CS7 germinal reversion in CS7/CS8
              heterozygotes, 4. cis- and trans-acting factors controlling CS7 excision will
              be identified and 5. maize proteins that bind the CS7 Ds and the CS8 Ds
              differently will be identified.  %%%  The goal of this research is to
              understand genetic control mechanisms in plants by examining mechanisms whereby
              plants regulate transposable element activity and how they interact with each
              other. Three transposons of corn which have inserted into identical positions
              on the corn genome have different germinal excision frequencies although such
              frequencies are identical in somatic cells. Studies will be initiated to
              determine the mechanisms controlling such differences in the corn plant. These
              studies will contribute to a more general understanding of factors regulating
              gene expression as well as allowing more insight into the participation of
              plant host factors in transposition.  ***
