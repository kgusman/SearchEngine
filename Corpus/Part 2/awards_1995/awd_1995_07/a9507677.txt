              9507677 Turpen    Amphibians are a unique model system for studying the
              hematopoietic and immune systems. Two mesodermal regions of the Xenopus 
              embryo, ventral blood islands and dorsal lateral plate, give rise to
              hematopoietic stem cells, the ppecursors of all red and white blood cells. This
              project will examine the contribution of dorsal and ventral regions to the
              profile of  blood cells developing in the liver, which is colonized by
              hematopoietic cells.  Since blood formation undergoes marked changes in the
              liver during metamorphosis the stem cell population will be examined to see if
              it changes during this period.   The origin of  T cells within the thymus, from
              the stem cells,  will also be examined.   The structure of the leukocyte common
              antigen , which is found on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells will also
              be determined.  This antigen is linked to two adjacent cytoplasmic phosphatase
              domains and is involved in the transduction of signals from the surface of the
              cell to its interior.  This project will isolate cDNA for the leukocyte common
              antigen expressed  by developing hema topoietic stem cells and use  DNA
              sequence analysis to compare the structure of the stem cell form to the form on
              other white blood cells.   %%%   This project which is looking at development
              of the hematopoietic and immune systems in Xenopus, will contribute to our
              understanding of the basic biology of the developing hematopoietic and immune
              systems. ***                          ;
