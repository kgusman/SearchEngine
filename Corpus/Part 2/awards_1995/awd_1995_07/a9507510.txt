Abstract    :
              9507510  Feather    This U.S.-Slovak cooperative research project between Dr.
              Milton  Feather of the University of Missouri-Columbia and Dr. Jan Hirsch  of
              the Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences, will  address a series
              of disaccharides, as starting compounds in the  Maillard reaction (nonenzymatic
              browning), a naturally occurring  reaction between sugars and proteins and/or
              amines.   These  sugars will be used to study the effects of position and 
              substitution of the nonreducing residue on the course of the  reaction.  In the
              process, the researchers intend to chemically  synthesize several series of
              disaccharides derived from D-xylose  and D-glucose to convert them into Amadori
              compounds (1-amino-1-  deoxy-2-ketose sugar compounds).  These compounds will
              then be  studied for degradation reactions.  Results are expected to  provide
              insight into far ranging natural processes such as those  that affect food
              flavor and aroma production to an in vivo  reaction involving protein
              modification related to aging and  diabetes.    This biochemistry project in
              organic dynamics fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling  leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe
              to  combine complementary talents and pool research resources in  areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence.      ***
