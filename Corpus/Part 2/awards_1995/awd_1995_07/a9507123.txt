Abstract    :
              9507123  Sheppard      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral 
              Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to
              twenty-four months of research abroad. The  program's awards provide
              opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary
              facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will
              support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Scott T. Sheppard to
              work with Dr. Ekkehard  Niemann at the Research Institute of Daimler Benz AG in
               Frankfurt, Germany.    This research project will develop silicon carbide
              (SiC)  integrated circuit technology for integration with SiC  microsensors
              being developed at Daimler-Benz.  The general  goal is a smart sensor
              technology, which is a combination of  a semiconductor microsensor (pressure,
              acceleration,  deflection) and its corresponding driving and readout  circuit. 
              The research will be done in three steps:  1)  Development and verification of
              new SPICE circuit models for  SiC up to 500 degrees Celsius; 2) Implementation
              of new  SPICE models to investigate different types of amplifier  circuits in
              SiC; and 3) Fabrication and demonstration of a  prototype IC amplifier suitable
              for integration with  microsensor tranducers and UV photodiodes. ***
