Abstract    :
              Barrick  9507992     The question of whether dinosaurs lacked effective
              temperature control and were heterotherms or were endothermic homeotherms has
              important implications for their life histories, evolution, rise to dominance
              in terrestrial ecosystems, and eventual extinction.  A great deal of evidence
              has been amassed regarding dinosaur endothermy which includes brain size,
              feeding mechanics, paleobiogeography, posture and gait, behaviors, bone
              histology and predator/prey relationships (Carroll, 1988; Weishample et al.,
              1990).  These studies have changed the general perception of dinosaurs and they
              are now thought of as active animals, though considered to be ectothermic or
              mass homeotherms (Ostrom, 1980).  During the initial phase of funding
              (EAR91-06660), we investigated the application of a new high precision   18O
              isotopic technique for the analysis of bone phosphate.  By using the isotopic
              difference between core body and extremities and the phosphate paleotemperature
              equation, realtive body temperature differences can be calculated to determine
              if an fossil animal was a heterotherm or homeotherm.  Of the 13 species of
              dinosaurs analyzed, all appear to be homeotherms with one Jurassic species
              exhibiting regional heterothermy.  These homeothermic bone isotope patterns
              cannot be ascribed to diagenetic alteration, because none of the specimens have
              isotopic equilibrium between the co-existing phases of bone phosphate with
              structural carbonate or calcite cements (co-existing phase test).  This
              proposal seeks funds to expand our modern bone isotope data base by working
              with the NCSU School of Veterinary Medicine on 5 modern target species.  The
              species will also propose to expand our fossil data base to complete our survey
              of different dinosaur clades, and also to search for the origins of homeothermy
              in therapsids and in a Triassic assemblage from Argentina.
