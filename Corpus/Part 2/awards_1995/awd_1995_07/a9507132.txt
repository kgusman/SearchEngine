              C. MCB-9507132 The goal of this project is to characterize the biochemical
              features of the anaerobic degradation of toluene by strain T1.  This is a novel
              isolate obtained in  this laboratory and preliminary work has already been done
              on the anaerobic pathway for toluene utilization in the microbe.  Toluene has
              two fates in T1, either productive metabolism and eventual conversion to carbon
              dioxide and biomass, or transformation to two dead-end metabolites,
              benzylsuccinate and benzylfumarate.  The formation of the same dead-end
              products during anaerobic toluene metabolism has also recently been reported in
               certain sulfate-reducing environments, and in several other denitrifying
              toluene degraders.  Thus, ths transformation may be environmentally
              significant.  It is proposed to develop enzyme assays using anaerobic cell
              extracts with an emphasis on identifying the reactants and products of key
              enzyme steps in the toluene metabolism by  T1.  Emphasis includes, determining
              the initial enzyme step in the toluene  utilization  pathway, designated the
              TUT pathway, as well as defining the initi al step in the formation of the
              toluene dead-end metabolites.  The research proposed is complementary to work
              currently underway by colleagues in the laboratory working on the genetic
              features of anaerobic toluene degradation by strain T1, and will make use of
              mutants unable to use toluene in order to resolve toluene degradation pathways.
              %%% Toluene is a major industrial chemical as well as a component of fuel.  It
              is also a hazardous waste in soil and aquatic environments.  A good deal has
              been learned about the degradation of toluene in air.  However, oxygen in
              pollution sites is rapidly used up, which makes the study of anaerobic
              metabolism so important.  The goal of this project is to characterize the
              beginning reactions performed by T1 anaerobically metabolize toluene.  Toluene
              has two fates in T1, either mineralization or transformation into two  dead-end
               chemical products that accumulate in the growth medium.  Studies will first be
              undertaken to identify initial reactions of toluene metabolism in extracts from
              cells, with the intention of continuing on to identify  key  enzymatic
              reactants and products in the separate degradation pathways.  This project will
              help provide a better understanding about the natural degradative processes in
              the environment and to use them effectively  to remediate contaminated sites.
