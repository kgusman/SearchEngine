Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of a never-before-possible, 
              next-generation lab for the teaching of x-ray diffraction (XRD).    Although
              XRD is one of the most heavily used and depended upon of  all analytical
              techniques in materials science and engineering,  it has been extremely
              difficult to teach because of the time  needed to run a typical x-ray scan.  
              Hence, most of the class  period is consumed by acquiring a scan, while any
              on-line,  real-time analysis of the XRD data is impossible.  Through this 
              project, a new XRD system is developed for real-time analysis of 
              crystallographic structures by using an x-ray generator with the  high-speed
              acquisition capabilities of a position sensitive  detector.   The XRD hardware
              is linked to analysis software and  databases by way of a local area network of
              PC-based engineering  workstations to provide on-line, real-time analysis of
              XRD data  and crystal structures.   In this way, the major difficulty in 
              teaching XRD, namely, the time needed to acquire a scan, is  substantially
              diminished.   This method revolutionizes the  teaching of XRD because extended
              exposure to advanced studies  involving XRD methodologies is available to
              undergrads for the  first time.
