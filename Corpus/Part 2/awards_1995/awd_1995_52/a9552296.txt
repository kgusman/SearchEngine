              University has historically based its successful  undergraduate program upon
              extensive formal and informal laboratory  experience, and in addition, many
              students do independent research  as an extension of the formal coursework.    
                  This project introduces a one semester course on Materials  Physics as a
              yearly offering into our curriculum.  This four credit  lecture/laboratory
              course will address topics in four broad  materials categories: (1) metals, (2)
              ceramics, (3) semiconductors  and (4) polymers.  Approximately ten experiments
              per semester will  be performed which will give an overview of the important 
              properties of each material type.  Modern techniques and equipment  will be
              employed and a computer interface utilized where  appropriate.  The experience
              resulting from this course will  prepare the student to be competitive in the
              research/industrial  workplace in a wide range of subdisciplines.  In addition,
              students  planning to pursue advanced degrees will be prepared to move into 
              Materials Science, Ceramic Engineering, Electrical Engineering,  Polymer
              Science and other areas in addition to the traditional  Physics graduate
              programs.  Such breadth of experience provides  students greater flexibility in
              choosing a career and will help in  making the physics degree more marketable.
