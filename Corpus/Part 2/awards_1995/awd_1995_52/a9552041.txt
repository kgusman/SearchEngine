                     Laboratory    The present proposal is aimed at asking for funds in the
              form of  equipment grant for adding the metal forming section in the 
              manufacturing processes laboratory. The Mechanical Engineering  Department of
              the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez offers two  compulsory courses, a
              lecture course (INME 4055) of 3 h/w and a  laboratory course (INME 4056) of 3
              h/w, to the senior undergraduate  programs of Mechanical Engineering as well as
              Industrial  Engineering Departments.    While the lecture course INME 4055
              deals extensively with the  theories and analyses of metalforming processes,
              such as rolling,  extrusion, forging, drawing, high energy rate forming, etc.,
              the  laboratory course INME 4056 offers no experiment on metalforming,  that is
              needed for complementing theory with laboratory practice.  The laboratory
              offers practice on machining, casting, welding and  metrology. A total void of
              laboratory in the area of metalforming,  therefore, produces an extreme
              imbalance of practical experience  between material removal processes
              (machining, grinding etc.) and  material forming processes (bulk deformation,
              sheet metal forming  etc.). This proposal, if and when accepted, will serve the
              propose  of filling the void between theory and practice in INME 4055 and  INME
              4056.
