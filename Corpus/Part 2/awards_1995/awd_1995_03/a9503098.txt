Abstract    :
                  This project will design, implement and experiment with an  operating system
              that satisfies the requirements of emerging  applications such  as multimedia,
              parallel computing, and  distributed information retrieval. These  performance
              critical  applications can be characterized by their intense use of 
              communication, and by their need for tight control of the  machine's resources.
               Existing operating systems often limit  the performance of such applications, 
              thereby preventing  users from reaping the power of high-performance computer 
              systems. As a result, lagging operating system technology  threatens to delay 
              the acceptance of parallel computing,  multimedia, and other services in the 
              emerging national  information infrastructure.    The major themes of the 
              project  are (1) designing OS  communications support that delivers performance
               close to  that provided by the network; (2) achieving OS performance  that 
              scales with the underlying computer system's  performance; and, (3) 
              investigating open service  implementations that allow customization of OS 
              services to  match precisely an application's requirements.  The goal is  to 
              deliver the resources provided by high-performance  computer systems to 
              applications, without sacrificing  functionality, fairness, safety, and 
              portability. Methods  include the re-evaluation of current operating systems in
               light of changing application requirements and hardware  performance 
              characteristics; design, implementation, and  experimentation with appropriate 
              solutions; and,  dissemination of results through publication and  distpibution
               of software artifacts.    Education plans of this CAREER project include the 
              development of an interactive teaching style, introduction  of a hands-on
              course  in parallel programming using networks  of workstations, and the
              organization of  a summer program  designed to expose junior high students to
              computer and  information technology.
