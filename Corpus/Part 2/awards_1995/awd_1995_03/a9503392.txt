               STUDIES IN NONLINEAR ANAYSIS: ABSTRACT     The proposed research is directed
              towards two types of problems   concerning the behavior of solutions to
              nonlinear differential   equations.  The first of these problems concerns the
              existence and   intermediate asymptotic behavior of self-similar solutions to
              the porous   medium equation (a degenerate nonlinear parabolic equation) and to
              the   Navier-Stokes equations of gas dynamics.  The objective here is to obtain
                the asymptotic description of various critical transitions in the flows  
              involved, such as the closing of holes (focusing) in porous medium flow   or
              the implosion of shock waves in gas dynamics.  The second problem   concerns
              the study of the dynamics of of load coupled arrays of Josephson   point
              junctions. These arrays are modeled by nonlinear systems of   ordinary
              differential equations, and the object of the study is to   understand the
              onset of stability and instability of various kinds of   phase locked
              solutions.  Particular emphasis will be placed on   predicting the loss of
              stability of phase lock and the dynamical   consequences of such a loss.    
              Self-similar solutions to partial differential equations are   solutions of a
              particularly simple structure determined by the underlying   symmetries of the
              equation.  They often arise in the asymptotic   description of critical
              transitions in the flow, because these   transitions are characteristic of the
              equations themselves and do   not depend on the details of the particular flow.
               An example of this   phenomenon occurs in engineering practice in connection
              with coating flows   of very viscous fluids.  The process of filling holes in
              such flows is   often described by a porous medium equation, and our results
              will be   useful in developing numerical methods for the study and control of
              such   processes.  Large arrays of load coupled Josephson junctions are used in
                many electronic devices such as  microwave generators and parametric  
              amplifiers.  In all these devices the most desirable operating condition   is
              one in which all of the junctions oscillate in unison.    Unfortunately, for
              various junction characteristics and load   configurations this phase locked
              state is not stable. It is therefore   important to know how to predict the
              stability and instability of the   phase locked state in terms of the parameter
              values for any particular array.
