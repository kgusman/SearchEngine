Abstract    :
              9503673  Bardet  This is an extension to the VELACS (Verification of
              Liquefaction  Analysis by Centrifuge Studies) project, the purpose of which was
               to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the existing  numerical and
              constitutive models used in the analysis of soil  liquefaction.  The motivation
              is to resolve the difficulties  encountered in the Class A predictions of
              VELACS, and to isolate  the main cause of these difficulties.    VELACS
              revealed that the current procedures used for the analysis  of geotechnical
              structures are not suitable, in general, for  predicting the consequences of
              soil liquefaction.  Some of the  most promising procedures available for the
              analysis of soil  liquefaction and its consequences will be identified in this 
              project.  A series of carefully-performed triaxial and torsional  tests are to
              be conducted and carefully examined, so as to  provide a small but reliable
              data base.  These data will be used  for the calibration of constitutive
              models, which in turn will be  used for a Class A prediction exercise of two
              centrifuge model  experiments.  The predictions will be compared with the 
              experimental results, and reasons for potential discrepancies  will be
              discussed.  Multiple checks for reliability will be  conducted in an effort to
              isolate reasons for the lack of  reliable predictions of the experiments
              already considered in the  VELACS project.  ***
