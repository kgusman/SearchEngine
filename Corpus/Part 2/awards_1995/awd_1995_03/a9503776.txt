Abstract    :
              The small flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of  the mustard family,
              has become the model system for plant  biology.  Its unique features allow it
              to be applied to a  wide variety of research problems, including plant 
              physiology, the molecular genetic study of organ  development, and
              plant-pathogen interactions.  The  importance of Arabidopsis to plant biology
              is increasing  with the international development of germplasm and DNA  stock
              resource centers, genetic and physical maps and their  techniques, plus
              expressed sequence tag and genomic  sequencing projects.  Furthermore, because
              flowering plants  evolved recently, characterizing a gene in Arabidopsis often 
              simplifies the isolation of a corresponding gene in another  flowering plant. 
              The primary mission of this project is to  provide a  specialized electronic
              database that can be used  by the  scientific community to collect,
              cross-reference,  organize, distribute and maintain the scientific data and 
              their  results.  The immediate goals are to create an  initial  prototype
              database with input from the user  community, and  to maintain the existing
              public Arabidopsis  database, AAtDB, in the interim.  It is expected that the 
              prototype developed  under this award will become a basis  for the next
              generation  Arabidopsis database that will meet  the needs of the researchers
              for the foreseeable future.
