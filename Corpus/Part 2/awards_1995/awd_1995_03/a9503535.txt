Abstract    :
              9503535  Steinfink    This award provides partial support of the purchase of a
              state-of-  the-art high resolution powder x-ray diffractometer.  The primary 
              users will be faculty, graduate students, research associates,  and
              post-doctoral students at the University of Texas at Austin.  The instrument
              has been chosen with accessories to meet the  specific needs of the research
              requirements of the user group.  The instrument will have at least a 4KW
              generator to produce a  high-intensity x-ray source from a sealed-off x-ray
              tube.  The  goniometer will be based on a theta/theta geometry with a Peltier 
              cooled solid state detector.  A variable goniometer radius will  permit an
              ultimate peak resolution of 0.025  2, especially  important in data collection
              for Rietveld structure refinement.  It will be equipped with a 486/66 or better
              computer with  software analysis capabilities equivalent to or better than
              those  sold by Materials Data Inc. (MDI).  The instrument will be  equipped
              with high and low temperature stages in which the  atmosphere can be
              controlled.  A thin film attachment will be  part of the system.  This
              equipment will be situated in an  existing laboratory that has the required
              space and utilities.  %%%  Several research topics that require a
              state-of-the-art powder  diffractometer will be pursued.  Its use will be
              heavily devoted  to the investigation of phase transitions in oxides and 
              chalcogenides as a function of temperature and atmosphere, to the  study of
              thin films especially for photocatalytic applications,  and the collection of
              data for crystal structure refinement by  the Rietveld technique.  These
              projects are supported by a  variety of public and private sources.  It is
              expected that these  procedures will constitute the major time allocation for
              this  instrument.  In addition to the furtherance of research projects,  the
              presence of this equipment in the Materials Science and  Engineering
              Laboratories will provide training of graduate  students in techniques of
              importan ce in materials science, an  area that is increasingly recognized as
              indispensable if this  country is to maintain competitiveness and leadership in
              the Age  of Materials.  ***
