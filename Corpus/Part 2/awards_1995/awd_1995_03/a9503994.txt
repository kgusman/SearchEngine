Abstract    :
              9503994  Samet     One of the emerging areas of research is the integration of
              databases containing nontraditional data with conventional databases.  New
              indexing methods are required in order to store and retrieve nontraditional
              data efficiently.  These methods must capture the nature of the data and sort
              on this information.  In this research the methods for integrating symbolic
              images into relational database systems will be extended to a more general case
              of images.  The problem is how to match the stored image with an observed image
              that is presented to the database as a query, but is taken from a different
              viewpoint.  A solution based on utilizing methods that are used in computer
              vision to solve these problems, and integrating these results into a relational
              (or any other) database system will be investigated.  The solution is based on
              the use of geometric invariants.  An additional research goal that extends this
              work into other nontraditional data types such as video data will also be
              performed.  As video is becoming a common data type in information systems,
              data management systems should support this new kind of data.  The important
              issue is how to extract contextual, spatial and temporal information from the
              video sequences in order to index on video data based on its contents.  A
              solution that is based on gathering information about methods that are used for
              this purpose in computer vision, and adapting them so they can be used in the
              framework of database systems will be outlined. In particular, using a system
              the recognizes facial expressions from video sequences of a human face is
              suggested as a testbed.  ***
