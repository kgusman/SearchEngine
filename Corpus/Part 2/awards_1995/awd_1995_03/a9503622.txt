Abstract    :
              9503622  Chang    This  U.S.-Mexico  award will help to support attendance  to 
              the  Fourth  International  Union  of  Materials  Research  Societies' 
              International Conference on Advanced Materials (IUMRS-ICAM 1995),  that  will 
              take  place in Cancun, Mexico  from  August  27th  to  September 1, 1995. 
              Support will be aimed at attracting promising  investigators   at   the   start
               of  their   research   careers.  Applications will be submitted in response to
              announcements to be  published  in  major  U.S.  materials societies' 
              bulletins.   An  international  organizing  committee, chaired  by  the 
              principal  investigator,  Dr. Robert Chang of Northwestern University,  will 
              select the U.S. participants.    This conference, which is co-sponsored by the
              International Union  of  Materials Research Societies (IUMRS) and the Mexican 
              Academy  of  Materials  (AMM), will provide an opportunity  for  materials 
              scientists  from  around  the  world  to  discuss  their   latest  discoveries.
               Thirty-two symposia on advanced materials  will  be  presented by leading
              scientists in their fields, and a series  of  proceedings of the conference
              will be published.  In addition  to  providing a valuable forum to exchange
              ideas, the conference will  encourage  the development of collaborations,
              particularly  among  scientists from Canada, Mexico and the United States. 
              This award  is  jointly  supported by the Division of Materials Research  and 
              the Division of International Programs of NSF.  ***
