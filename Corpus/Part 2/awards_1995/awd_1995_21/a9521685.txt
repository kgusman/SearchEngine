Abstract    :
                             This proposal documents an instrumental  improvement important in
              the dissertation           research of Andrew Bullen. This research examines 
              the conduction and integration of           electrophysiological signals in the
              dendrites of  cultured mamrr~ CNS neurons using fast           optical
              recording techniques. Andrew is a student  at the University of Pennsylvania
              School of           Medicine who is undertaking his doctoral research  at
              Baylor College of Medicine in order to           exploit the unique
              instrumental resources available  in the laboratory of Dr. Peter Saggau.       
                       The primary instrumental resource used in  these investigations is a
              novel High-Speed           Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscope previously 
              developed in Dr Saggau's lab. The           bandwidth of this system (200,000
              points/second) is  considerably greater than existing scanning          
              microscopes. This bandwidth is achieved through the  incorporation of
              acoustic-optic deflectors as           its only scanning mechanism. This
              instrument was  previously used to record from brain slices           (Saggau
              et al., 1990).                 This microscope has been further developed  for
              simultaneous multisite recording from two           fluorescent indicators in
              the dendrites of  mammalian CNS neurons. These modifications have          
              allowed studies of neuronal integration within a  single cell and
              investigations of signaling between           cultured neurons (Bullen &
              Saggau, 1994). These  studies employed voltage-sensitive dyes and          
              calcium indicators, but other probes are planned  for future experiments.      
                        Notwithstanding its fast scanning rate and  large bandwidth, the
              current system has several           limitations that have been highlighted by
              these  recent experiments. These limitations include           modest spatial
              resolution, small scanning field  size and poor signal-to-noise ratio in fine
              neuronal           processes.                 A simple  improvement is proposed
              to overcome  these limitations and further enhance the           performance of
              this instrument. By replacing the  existing acousto-optic deflectors with
              equivalent           devices able to produce more spots (70 vs 10 spots)  over
              a larger initial deflection angle           (40 mrad. vs 5 mrad.), the scanning
              field size will  be significantly enlarged and the relative spatial          
              resolution improved. The absolute spatial  resolution will also be increased
              because the net spot           size will be smaller (2 ~m vs 10 llm).
              Furthermore,  the smaller spot size will enhance the signal-           to-noise
              ratio and allow events of smaller  magnitude to be resolved. These irnproved
              deflectors           will also provide homogenous illumination and  thereby
              facilitate a uniform signal-to-noise ratio           throughout the scanning
              field.                 The proposed change can be implemented  without
              compromising the existing bandwidth           of the system or any major
              structural alterations.                 In summary, a minor change to an
              existing  High-Speed Laser Scanning Fluorescence           Microscope is
              proposed. This modification will make  this instrument more sensitive and able
              to           sample a larger area with greater spatial  resolution. The impact
              of these features will allow           simultaneous mulitsite optical
              recordings of small  events from fine neuronal structures.          
              Measurements of this nature were not previously  possible and should
              significantly advance the           understanding of information processing in
              the  dendrites of mammalian CNS neurons.                     NSF FORM 1358
