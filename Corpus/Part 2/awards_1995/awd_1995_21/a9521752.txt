Abstract    :
              9521752  HOLSINGER   Amphipod Crustacea are a very diverse group of invertebrate
              animals with both freshwater and marine members.  In both aquatic environments,
              these animals, often present in large population numbers, are important
              elements of food webs.  Yet, as with many invertebrate groups, the amphipods
              include many undescribed species, are in need of revisionary or monographic
              systematic analysis, and have few systematic specialists capable of conducting
              such research.  Dr. John Holsinger is a recognized taxonomic authority for
              amphipods.  With this award he will address monographic systematic revisions of
              groups in two families of amphipods.  The award will also support the training
              of  graduate students in the systematics of Crustacea.   Databases will be
              developed for the specimens examined as well as interactive electronic
              identification keys.  These keys will be of value to people concerned with
              environmental quality because the amphipods that are the focus of this study
              inhabit subterranean waters and can serve as indicators of groundwater quality
              for the aquifers they inhabit.   The results of this research will contribute
              to our knowledge of an important element of Crustacean biodiversity.  New
              practicing systematists will be trained to assume research with these organisms
              in the future and practical electronic keys to species will be produced that
              should be of utility to researchers and managers concerned with monitoring
              water quality.
