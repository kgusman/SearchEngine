Abstract    :
              9521299  Bannon        The ability of atmospheric scientists to numerically
              model the atmosphere is  fundamental for improved understanding of atmospheric
              processes and for weather  prediction.  Accordingly, it is important to
              understand the energetics of the  atmosphere and the capabilities of various
              numerical representations of the  atmosphere to adequately simulate the
              energetics.        The Principal Investigator will pursue a
              theoretical/numerical investigation of  a process known as atmospheric
              adjustment which is defined as the response of a  compressible atmosphere to a
              prescribed heating.  The study of atmospheric  adjustment deals with the
              tendency of the atmosphere to return to a state of balance  after the imbalance
              caused by rapid atmospheric heating such as might be caused by  convective
              clouds.          The atmospheric energetics due to rapid heating will be
              examined with an  assessment of the partitioning of energy between acoustic and
              gravity modes.  Often   atmospheric numerical models are constructed to remove
              acoustic waves, for they  are not considered meteorologically important. 
              Recent research by the PI, however,  has shown that this might not be the case.
                     This research will serve two practical functions.  Since the research
              will  assess the role of acoustic modes in weather phenomena, a means will be
              developed  to document the merits of anelastic (non-acoustic) equations
              relative to fully  compressible equations (those that allow for acoustic
              waves).  The research also will  provide a benchmark against which various
              weather numerical models can be tested.  ***
