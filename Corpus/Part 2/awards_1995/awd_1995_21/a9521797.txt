Abstract    :
                           The Keys Marine Laboratory (KML) commenced academic  research and 
              education programs in the 1980's through a public/private  partnership  between
              the Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO) and Sea  World of  Florida, Inc.
              Based on the success of that partnership and  recognizing  the need for these
              programs and facilities the State of  Florida  purchased the KML in 1990. With
              the closure of other  residential  laboratory facilities in the region and the
              unprecedented  scientific  and political attention on the mosaic of South
              Florida  environments,  the KML has now assumed an even more critical support
              role.  In the last  five years usage by research and education groups has 
              increased  steadily and is beginning to exceed some of the capabilities  of the
               current facilities. Particularly urgent is the need for  improved and 
              expanded housing accommodations for non-resident  researchers. Lodging  has
              been identified as one of the major impediments to  conducting  research in the
              region. Laboratory and boat facilities are  equally  important but at this
              point in time the KML can reasonably  accommodate  these needs. This project
              will provide funding to construct  the first  unit of a planned three-unit
              handicapped accessible housing  facility  which will provide additional lodging
              space for two to four  (2-4)  researchers/unit. This facility will help meet
              the need of  regional,  national, and international scientists studying the 
              continentally  unique systems of South Florida, including coral reefs.
