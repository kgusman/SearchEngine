Abstract    :
              9521013  Dobson   Understanding why some individuals in a population are more
              successful at raising offspring than others is central to gaining insight into
              evolution via natural selection.  Scientists have developed several
              explanations for the evolution of family size for species with extended
              parental care.  Since these hypotheses each make specific predictions about
              offspring and parental survival during and after reproduction, a properly
              designed field study can test these explanations.    This study will be the
              first field study to employ this technique in small mammals.  New- born flying
              squirrels will be moved among nests in order to study why mothers give birth to
              litters of a certain number of young.  The effects of altering a mother's
              litter size can be monitored throughout the rest of her reproductive life. 
              Young female squirrels settle near their mother so the effects of litter size
              on the offspring's' reproduction can also be monitored.    This study will lead
              to important insights into natural selection.   Additionally, the results  can
              have applications to the conservation of rare animals and may even shed light
              on how to an increase food production from the animal farming industries. 
              Understanding what factors set the upper limit to family size per reproductive
              event is the first step in searching for ways to increase production of young.
              Increasing reproduction in rare animals would have obvious applications towards
              saving animals from extinction, while increasing reproduction in an
              economically important animal may help increase the production of protein for
              an increasing human population.
