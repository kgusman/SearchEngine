Abstract    :
              9521254  Gilbert      This project will study the composition, biological
              availability,  and rates of uptake and release of dissolved organic nitrogen in
               two highly contrasting estuarine systems- the Chesapeake Bay and  Georgia
              coastal rivers.  These systems are vastly different with  respect to the type,
              source and relative liability of dissolved  organic nitrogen.  Because the
              Principal Investigators will conduct  their studies in conjunction with the two
              currently funded Land  Margin Ecosystem Research studies at the these sites,
              the results  will greatly enhance the understanding of these important coastal 
              aquatic environments. The significance of the proposed research is  several
              fold.  First, in the broadcast, sense the eutrophication of  nation's coastal
              waters and estuaries is a well recognized problem,  yet we have little
              knowledge of the contribution and importance of  organic nitrogen to this
              problem. Second, with the advent of new  techniques, these studies will yield
              and appreciation of the  mechanisms by which both bacteria and phytoplankton
              obtain their  nitrogenous nitrogen will aid our ability to balance and control 
              the flow of nitrogen through estuarine and coastal systems.
