Abstract    :
              9521382  Swift    In this project, the PI will participate, with Scripps Ocean
              Data  Facility (ODF) personnel, in oceanographic sections crossing from  the
              Siberian continental shelves into the Nansen, Amundsen, and  Makarov basins of
              the Arctic Ocean, and a transect of the  Siberian ends of the three basins in
              July-September, 1996, as  part of the ACSYS (ARCtic System Sciences) program on
              both  Swedish and German icebreakers.  The PI proposes to augment the  full
              depth CTD measurements by providing 36-place rosettes, and  carrying out
              top-quality measurements of salinity, dissolved  oxygen, and nutrients at about
              120 locations along the tracks.  These data are crucial to understanding the
              interactionsof the  Arctic Ocean circulation on the global climate system.  The
              ODF  capability will add a very important element of quality control  to this
              set of measurements.  ***
