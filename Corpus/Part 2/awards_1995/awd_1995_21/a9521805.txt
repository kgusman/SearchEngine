Abstract    :
              9521805  Neumark        The aim of this research is to learn about how the
              properties  of semiconductor clusters evolve over a large size range,  spanning
              the molecular limit (10 atoms or less) up to the  nanocrystalline regime (1000
              atoms or more). The proposed  experiments are specifically aimed at probing the
              electronic  and vibrational spectroscopy of these clusters as a function  of
              their size. The experiments will be conducted using two  negative ion
              photodetachment techniques: photoelectron  spectroscopy, for medium resolution
              (10 meV) survey work, and  anion zero electron kinetic energy (ZEKE)
              spectroscopy for  much higher resolution studies (0.2-0.3 meV). These
              techniques  combine size-selectivity with reasonable spectral resolution  and
              hence are ideal for spectroscopic studies of clusters over  a wide size range. 
              %%%  The spectroscopy of size-selected clusters offers an  unprecedented
              opportunity to understand how the properties of  matter evolve from the
              molecular to the bulk limits. This type  of work is appealing from the
              perspective of fundamental  chemistry and physics, since we can learn how the
              molecular  orbitals and vibrational frequencies of small molecules evolve  into
              the electronic bands and phonons in extended crystalline  structures. From a
              more applied point-of-view, small clusters  have been implicated in the
              problems that arise in the plasma  processing of semiconductors, and larger
              semiconductor clusters  are beginning to show promise for use in electronic
              devices.  Further characterization of the energetics and structure of the 
              species involved in these applications is therefore highly  desirable. This
              proposal is specifically aimed at mapping out  the electronic and vibrational
              spectroscopy of semiconductor  clusters over a wide size range, from less than
              10 to more than  1000 atoms. To conduct this work, one requires experiments 
              which combine size-selectivity with reasonable spectral  resolution. This will
              be accomplished using two negative ion  photodetachmen t techniques:
              photoelectron spectroscopy and, for  higher resolution work, anion zero
              electron kinetic energy  spectroscopy.
