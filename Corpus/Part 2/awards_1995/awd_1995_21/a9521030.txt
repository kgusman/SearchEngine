Abstract    :
              9521030  Grischkowsky  Ultra-dense, ultra-fast digital computing of the future
              will  require the transmission and reception of ps/subps  electromagnetic
              signals along wires and directly through free  space, in a 0.1 um/sub-0.1 um
              minimum feature size environment.   This interconnect requirement is largely
              independent of the  ultimate choice of the type of active device.  Using 
              optoelectronic techniques to generate ps/subps waveforms, we will  have
              demonstrated that guided wave propagation effects must be  considered on the
              electronic chip level.  Through our  measurements, we will have generated a
              knowledge base on which a  realistic transmission-line based wire interconnect
              could be  designed.  Using optoelectronic techniques, we will have 
              demonstrated both free-space, chip-to-chip and freely propagating  wave,
              on-chip THz interconnects.  We believe this project will  set important new
              directions for the development of ultrahigh  performance interconnect and will
              also lead to a whole new  perspective on the characteristics of ideal ultrahigh
              performance  active devices of the future.  ***
