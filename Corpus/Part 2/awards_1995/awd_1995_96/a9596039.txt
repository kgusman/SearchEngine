Abstract    :
              9350159 Kurfess          The award is for the conduct of research and teaching
              in the area of precision engineering.  Research activities will be focused on
              precision control, instrumentation, dynamics and large scale data reduction and
              are motivated by the need to enhance capabilities in advanced high speed
              metrology.  Research issues addressed include control of measurement
              probe/workpiece surface interaction, precise control of probe motion, and
              efficient processing of large amounts of data collected during the scanning
              process.  Teaching activities will be focused on control theory and quality
              assurance, with examples drawn from   applications          The research should
              result in a coordinate measurement machine scanning capability of 40
              millimeters/second with typical scanning accuracies of 10 micrometers and would
              be of great value to manufacturers who rely on precision inspection technology.
               The teaching activities would result in undergraduate and graduate students
              who are well versed in control theory and its application to precision
              engineering.
