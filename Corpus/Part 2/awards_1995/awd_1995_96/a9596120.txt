Abstract    :
                   This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing                 
              award IRI-9213894.  In previous research, an approach to the formal            
              study of language, Harmonic Grammar, relies on a novel means of                
              integrating connectionist and symbolic computation.  The current               
              research studies extensions of this approach, concerning formal                
              grammars of natural languages and grammars of formal languages.                
              Specifically, the previous work is extended:  to encompass                     
              recursive, fully distributed connectionist representations; to                 
              develop an explicit symbolic programming language to characterize              
              the computations over these representations carried out by a new               
              class of connectionist networks; to study the expressive power of              
              Harmonic Grammar to describe formal languages, starting with a                 
              study of context-free languages; to analyze the properties of                  
              connectionist networks that lead to a recursive, embedding-                    
              invariant well-formedness (Harmony) function; to test the ability              
              of Harmonic Grammar to deal with linguistic problems crucially                 
              involving embedding; to assess the effectiveness of our fully                  
              distributed representations for encoding the features of                       
              syntactic/semantic structural roles in linguistic representations;             
              to extend the theory to incorporate the symbolic computational                 
              notion of unification, and to apply it to unification-based                    
              approaches to natural language grammar; to study the effectiveness             
              and temporal behavior of connectionist parsers that implement both             
              the numerical and nonnumerical formalizations of Harmonic Grammar;             
              and to extend recent work on connectionist learning of symbolic                
              rule systems to the particular case of Harmonic Grammar.//
