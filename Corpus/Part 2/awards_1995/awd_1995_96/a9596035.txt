Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports cooperation between US and Chinese                         
              investigators on a study of political behavior in China, which is              
              undergoing a rapid socio-economic transformation.  Using data                  
              already collected in China in 1990, combined with new data                     
              scheduled to be acquired in the summer of 1993, the research team              
              hopes to explore issues of political participation in a non-                   
              democratic regime which is in transition, and to develop a                     
              scientifically credible database from which to test hypotheses                 
              about political culture which have been largely constructed from               
              study of liberal democracies.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Political participation, defined in this study as voluntary                    
              citizen activity directed at influencing government policies or                
              personnel,  has largely been unexamined in countries such as                   
              China.  This study will provide a crucial building block in                    
              understanding any contemporary political system.  Additionally,                
              the study should shed light on one of the looming questions about              
              the twentyfirst century, the prospects for political change in                 
              the remaining communist power, the People's Republic of China.                 
              The research will be conducted by U.S. researchers from the                    
              University of Iowa, Columbia University, and Chinese researchers               
              from People's University in Beijing, China.
