Abstract    :
              9453026  Fuhrman  The Consortium for Policy Research in Education (CPRE)
              proposes to  study the relationship between the Urban Systemic Initiatives 
              (USI), the Statewide Initiatives (SSI), the Goals 2000 Initiatives,  and other
              state reforms in selected states.  The primary purpose is  to "map" the
              substantive, policy between NSF supported activities  and the larger context of
              state, local and federal initiatives,  including Goals 2000.  A related purpose
              is to advance  understanding of how ambitious educational improvement
              initiatives  can best navigate and enhance city-state relationships.
