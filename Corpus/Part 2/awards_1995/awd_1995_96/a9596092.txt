Abstract    :
              In ranked data each observation is a permutation of n items.   Because the
              permutations do not have a natural linear ordering,  many common statistical
              methods are inappropriate for ranked  data.  However, the permutations of n
              items can be naturally  placed on the vertices of a polytope inscribed in a
              sphere in n-1  dimensional Euclidean space.  This geometry suggests new 
              graphical and analytical methods for analyzing full and partially  ranked data.
               Of particular interest are probability density  histograms, spectral analysis,
              kernal smoothing methods, and  confidence regions.  Statistical methods are
              proposed to analyze ranked data.  Ranked  data occur when a group of "judges"
              are asked to evaluate a set  of items and then to rank them in order of
              preference.  Hence,  each "judge" states his first, second, etc., and last
              choices  among the items that he has evaluated.  Proper methods to  graphically
              display and analyze ranked data are very important.  This type of data is
              encountered frequently in the social  sciences, in market research, and in
              elections.  A less well  known, but equally important area in which ranked data
              are  encountered is expert systems for military applications.
