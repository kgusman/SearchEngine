Abstract    :
                  9311077  Balch         This project will address the magnitude of the 
              calcification relative to the organic production in the  Arabian Sea as part of
              the U.S. JGOFS program.  Geological  and geochemical evidence points to calcite
              dominating the  burial of carbon in this very productive region.  However,  no
              direct estimates of calcification exist at time scales  compatible with
              standard photosynthesis measurements.  Indirect estimates based on vertical
              changes in alkalinity  and TCO2 suggest that euphotic zone calcification rates
              will  be on the order of 0.3-0.4 gC m-2d-1 during the SE monsoon  as compared
              to primary production of 1-2 gC m-2 d-1.  Indirect estimates based on 
              sediments accumulation rates  give very similar predictions.  In terms of
              carbon burial,  however, the organic carbon is preferentially remineralized 
              such that the regional organic carbon deposition is 2.65x10  5 tonnes C yr-1,
              less than a tenth of the calcite burial of  3.6x10 6 tonnes C y-1 over the
              northern Arabian Sea.  Such  indirect estimates of calcite production require
              broad  assumptions which need to be validated with empirical data.  Direct
              isotope estimates of calcification are essential to  understanding the
              magnitude of the production rate of  calcite, measured on time scales
              compatible with standard  primary production measurements.  Equally important
              will be  the comparison of the estimates of calcification with  geochemical
              estimates made by others in the program.  ***
