Abstract    :
              The Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) at the University of Florida (UF) 
              recently acquired three, significant, orphaned collections of invertebrate
              fossils.  Each collection  is composed primarily of specimens from the Cenozoic
              of Florida and the southeastern U.S. and each  represents a unique, scientific
              research resource.  The Invertebrate Paleontology (IP) Division at the  museum
              will execute a three-year project to curate these orphaned collections and
              integrate them into  its Systematic, Type, and Stratigraphic collections, as
              appropriate.  the ultimate goal of this  project is to preserve the specimens
              and associated information within each of these valuable research  collections
              and to make them available to the scientific community.  Each collection
              presents distinct  strengths and challenges.  The collections include:  (1)
              Florida Geological Survey Collection.  In  1993 the Florida Geological Survey
              (FGS)  in Tallahassee officially transferred its collection of  fossil
              invertebrates to the FLMNH for permanent care and conservation.  The FGS
              Collections large (  13,000 catalogued  and ca. 5,000 uncatalogued lots),
              represents most of the stratigraphic units in the  state, and contains over 178
              primary types as well as many figured, referred, and voucher specimens.  (2)
              Hunter-Banks Collection.  This large collection was made during 1960-1978 by
              Muriel E. Hunter and  the Lake Joseph E. Banks while employed by the Coastal
              Petroleum Company of Tallahassee, FL.  It  consists of fossil invertebrates
              from Florida (85%), the southeastern U.S. (10%), and form abroad (  5%).  The
              vast majority of the specimen lots (ca. 22,200) were stratigraphically
              collected,  including  many sites which are no longer accessible. (3) Victor
              Zullo Collection.  Shortly after his untimely  death in July 1993, the fossil
              barnacle collection of Dr. Victor Zullo was transferred to the FLMNH  from the
              University of North Caroline, Wilmington.  This vital collection (ca. 1,000
              lots) consists  primarily of balanomorph barlacles which Zullo was researching.
               The collection is accompanied by 10  manuscripts in various stages of
              completion which are being distributed to appropriate workers for  completion. 
              The collection will contain many primary and secondary type specimens which
              result from  this systematic research.
