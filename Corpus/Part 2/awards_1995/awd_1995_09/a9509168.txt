Abstract    :
                    9509168  Sellner    This project addresses the hypothesis that the
              developmental  expression of the heart subtype of fatty acid-binding protein
              (H-  FABP) is related to the simultaneous development of  neurotransmitter
              systems in the brain, namely GABA. The hypothesis  is based on 1) similar
              localization of the proteins by  immunohistochemistry, 2) the documented timing
              of differentiation  of particular pathways/regions in the brain at a time when
              H-FABP  is also present, 3) data showing effects of free fatty acids on  both
              the GABA transporter and the GABA-a receptor, and 4) in vitro  studies showing
              an enhanced uptake of GABA by synaptosomes when  exogenous H-FABP is added. The
              hypothesis will be addressed by  developing a cell culture system from neonatal
              mouse cerebellum,  using established protocols. The cultures will be examined
              for  their expression of H-FABP using antiserum prepared against  synthetic
              peptides and using synthetic oligonucleotide probes. The  presence of the GABA
              transporter will be verified by measuring 3H-  GABA uptake by the cultures.
              Next, the efdects of exogenously added  fatty acids on the levels of H-FABP and
              on rates of GABA uptake  will be studied. Finally, antisense oligonucleotides
              will be added  to the cultures to inhibit the expression of H-FABP, and effects
              on  GABA uptake will be determined. The activities described in this  proposal
              are designed to obtain sufficient pilot data to warrant  submission of a major
              grant proposal.  ***
