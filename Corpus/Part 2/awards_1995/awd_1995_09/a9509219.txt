              Biegalke Alteration of the transcriptional activity of promoters is a major
              mechanism used to control the resulting amount of gene product produced. Viral
              model systems have been very useful in elucidating the elements involved in
              transcriptional regulation. Human cytomegalovirus provides an excellent model
              for the study of transcriptional regulation. One viral protein, pp71, is a
              novel transcriptional activator; activating a viral promoter through multiple
              copies of an Ap 1 binding site as well as additional as yet unidentified
              sequences. This project will identify the additional sequences that contribute
              to promoter activation by pp71. During this planning activity, deletion and
              mutagenesis analyses will be performed to identify the second target elements
              involved in pp71 transactivation.  A full research proposal will be submitted
              using this preliminary work as a foundation for the investigation of the
              mechanism of transcription activation. %%% The appropriate expression of
              specialized proteins is required for differentiation and development. Signals
              that control the expression of special ized proteins can be identified and have
              been identified in large part by using viruses as model systems. One human
              herpes virus, human cytomegalovirus, provides a particularly useful model
              system for investigating the controls that determine protein expression. A
              novel viral regulatory protein, pp71, has been identified in human
              cytomegalovirus. pp71 along with other control elements and proteins influences
              the amount of viral protein production. Identification of the other control
              elements and proteins will further the understanding of regulatory processes in
              general and will allow examination of additional systems to see if these
              mechanisms are commonly utilized.  This planning activity will provide the
              foundation for a full proposal to study the mechanism of pp71 transcription
              activation. ***                                 @
