Abstract    :
              9509042  Williamson  Questions about what processes regulate community
              organization have been a central theme in ecology for a long time. With
              increasing evidence for important changes in abiotic factors such as climate,
              and UV-B radiation, our need for a better understanding of the interactions
              between abiotic and biotic variables in natural communities becomes crucial.
              While a great deal is known about the role of predation and visible light in
              structuring pelagic communities in lakes, the ecology of damaging short
              wavelength solar radiation in these pelagic communities is poorly understood.
              The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the role of damaging
              solar radiation (DSR) in zooplankton communities, and more specifically, to
              examine the ecological interactions between this abiotic factor and predation,
              an important biotic factor. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the primary
              factor controlling attenuation of damaging solar radiation along a vertical
              gradient in lakes, as well as among lakes. In this study, several hypotheses
              will be tested regarding the interactive effects of DOC and DSR on zooplankton
              communities along environmental gradients in Pennsylvania and Alaska. Both
              field and laboratory manipulations and observations will be used to test these
              hypotheses.   The focus on damaging solar radiation has important implications
              for community structure and function in aquatic ecosystems. Zooplankton provide
              a key link in aquatic food webs and their distribution and abundance has
              important implications for both water quality and energy transfer to higher
              trophic levels. The data collected will also permit evaluation of the relative
              importance of physiological versus behavioral responses of organisms to
              gradients of damaging solar radiation both within and among lakes.
