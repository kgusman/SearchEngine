              cycle of fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression of sak1+  delays
              cell cycle progression and causes cells to slow their rate of growth. Thus,
              analogous to tumor suppresser genes, sak1+ is likely to encode an element of a
              pathway coordinating cell growth and events of the cell cycle. The predicted
              protein product of the sak1+ gene contains several strong regions of homology
              to a family of transcription factors identified in humans and mice. Members of
              this family, known as RFX, are involved in regulation of many cellular and
              viral genes. The regions of homology between sak1+ and the RFX proteins are
              highly significant because they correspond to important functional domains. In
              particular, a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain and a motif associated
              with the ability of RFX to activate transcription are also highly conserved in
              sak1+. The structural conservation observed between yeast RFX and human RFX
              suggests that these regions may also be functionally conserved. The short te
