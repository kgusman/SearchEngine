Abstract    :
              9509847  Hu    This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Research grant will support  the
              collaborative research of Dr. Bei-Lok Hu and three  advanced graduate students
              from the University of Maryland  College Park with Drs. Esteban Calzetta, Juan
              Pablo Paz, and  Diego Mazzitelli of the University of Buenos Aires in  quantum
              statistical field theory in gravitation and  cosmology.  Themes to be
              investigated include decoherence  and quantum-to-classical transition; galaxy
              formation in  inflationary cosmology; phase transition in the early  universe,
              and general relativity as an effective theory.    The experienced collaborators
              have probed the laws of nature  and the structure of space-time at the Planck
              scale,  obtaining results on early universe and black hole  processes.   The
              concepts and techniques of non-equilibrium  statistical mechanics and the
              formalisms of quantum  stochastic field theory established in their joint work
              are  to be further developed and applied to problems on  relativity and
              cosmology under this grant. The team,  including advanced graduate  students,
              will collaborate  closely in the generation and pursuit of new ideas and 
              problems within the themes described.  ***
