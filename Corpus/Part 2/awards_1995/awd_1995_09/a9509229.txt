Abstract    :
                    9509229  Honma  The long term goal of the proposed research is to
              understand  the developmental changes that occur during the transition  from
              vegetative to reproductive growth in Arabidopsis  thaliana.  Physiological
              experiments suggest that  environmental as well as endogenous factors regulate
              the  time to flowering.  Relatively little is known, however,  about the genes
              and their protein products that are required  in this critical transition to
              the reproductive state.  The  identification of mutants altered in floral
              induction and  the isolation of the corresponding genes will contribute to  the
              understanding of this complex process.  An Ac/Ds  transposon system was
              developed for mutagenesis and gene  isolation.  This system has been used to
              generate an early  flowering mutant, eaf20, that makes the vegetative to 
              reproductive transition earlier than wild-type plants grown  in the same
              condition.  Genetic and molecular experiments  indicate that the eaf20 gene is
              tagged with Ds. The Ds  transposon sequences were used to isolate a small
              segment of  the flanking genomic region that encodes the flowering gene. 
              Future experiments will focus on isolation and  characterization of genomic and
              cDNA clones that correspond  to the eaf20 gene.  Genomic clones covering the
              eaf20 region  will be cloned using the previously isolated Ds flanking 
              sequence.  To confirm that the eaf20 gene has been isolated,  a complementation
              experiment will be done in which the  genomic clones are introduced into the
              eaf20 mutant plants  and screened for rescue of the mutant phenotype. 
              Sequencing  of the genomic copies of the eaf20 gene will provide  valuable
              information regarding regulatory regions of the  gene that will be used for
              subsequent studies.  The genomic  clones will also be used to isolate eaf20
              cDNAs.  Sequencing  the eaf20 cDNAs will be followed by database searches to 
              look for regions of similarity to genes with known  biochemical functions. 
              These molecular studies will lay the  foundation for fut ure experiments and
              will contribute to our  understanding of floral induction in Arabidopsis.
