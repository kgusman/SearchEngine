Abstract    :
              9509975  Lafortune       The research covered by this proposal describes: (i)
              the  development of a comprehensive methodology for failure diagnosis  of
              large-scale complex dynamic systems modeled as discrete event  systems; (ii)
              application areas where the methodology will be  applied and tested.        
              This research will build on previous work of the PIs which  so far has been
              restricted to passive diagnosis of live  languages,i.e., to live languages
              where no control commands are  issued specifically for the purpose of
              diagnosing failures.  In  passive diagnosis, the following issues will be
              addressed; (i)  what is the most detailed diagnosis of failures that one can 
              achieve with a given set of sensors? (ii) given the desired  diagnosability
              requirements of a system, what is a minimum set of  sensors such that these
              diagnosability requirements are achieved?   (iii) how is diagnosability of
              non-live languages defined and  under what conditions is a non-live language
              diagnosable?         This research will also address the problem of active 
              diagnosis, which is the situation where control commands are  issued
              specifically for the purpose of diagnosing failures.  In  active diagnosis, the
              objective will be the systematic  construction of supervisors such that the
              resulting closed-loop  system is diagnosable within the allowable delay limits.
                      Several application areas where problems of failure  diagnosis arise
              have been identified.  In collaboration with  colleagues from industry,
              discrete event models for failure  diagnosis in these applications areas will
              be developed.  These  models will guide the theoretical research and will test
              the  methodology to realistic systems.  ***
