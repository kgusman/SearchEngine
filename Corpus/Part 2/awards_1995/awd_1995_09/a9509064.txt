Abstract    :
              9509064  Bagley  This research details the utilization of static and time
              resolved  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for delineating the 
              molecular mechanism of hydrogen binding and activation in Ni  hydrogenases. 
              The research objectives are: (1) Determination of  whether the anomalous
              infrared bands detected between 2100 and 1900  cm-1 are general features of Ni
              hydrogenases.  To this end a series  of infrared studies will be carried out on
              a well-characterized  hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio gigas. (2) Identification
              of the  structure responsible for these unusual infrared signatures using 
              infrared spectroscopy coupled with chemical modification of the  enzyme and the
              study of isotopically labeled enzyme. (3)  Utilization of the three infrared
              signatures for further study of  the various redox states of the enzyme.  This
              approach provides a  unique opportunity; Ni hydrogenases display at least two
              EPR-silent  species which are distinguishable by their infrared signatures in 
              the 2100 and 1900 cm-1 spectral region. (4) Utilization of mid-  infrared
              spectroscopy to examine the role individual amino acids  play in the activation
              of hydrogen. (5)  Examination of the  oxidation state of the Ni center in
              various redox states of the  enzymes.  This approach used the infrared
              detectable carbon  monoxide stretching frequency, arising from Ni bound carbon 
              monoxide, as a probe of the oxidation state of the Ni.  %%%  Ni Hydrogenases
              are enzymes that catalyze the simplest reaction in  nature and the simplest
              conversion of electrical energy into  chemical energy of universal utility: 2e-
              + 2H+ = H2.  This research  involves a spectroscopic study of the anomalous
              infrared absorption  bands that are characteristic of these enzymes.  Infrared 
              spectroscopic studies will be made on the well-characterized Ni  hydrogenases
              from Desulfovibrio gigas.  It is a anticipated that  this work will have
              important consequences for understanding the  mechanism underlying Ni
              hydrogenase's ability to split molecular   hydrogen into protons and electrons.
               The work also involves the  development of methodologies for handling infrared
              samples under  strictly anaerobic conditions, and should prove of general
              utility  in infrared studies of other oxygen sensitive metallo-proteins.  ***
