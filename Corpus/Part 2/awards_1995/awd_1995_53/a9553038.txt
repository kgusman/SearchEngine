Abstract    :
              9553038  Doumanidis   This Presidential Faculty Fellow award is for Dr.
              Doumanidis's excellence in education and research  innovations in rapid
              prototyping technology.  His plan for research innovation and discovery focuses
              on new thermal rapid prototyping processes.   Doumanidis will use optical and
              thermal feedback for distributed parameter control of scanned heat and mass
              transfer processes to build geometry and regulate the material structure of
              parts produced by rapid prototyping.  Complementing this innovative research
              plan is a balanced educational plan to motivate first year university students
              and orient in-service teachers towards technology, with prototyping, home
              robotics, and a manufacturing automation seminar the means to reach these
              objectives.  The coherent plan of research and education in the PFF nomination
              continues an a very productive record of accomplishment and leadership as a
              scholar and educator.   The high probability of new discovery in the fertile
              research area of rapid prototyping, plus Dr. Doumanidis's education plan to aid
              the teachers of future generations of students of  technology, will have an
              impact on developing   human resources and increasing competitiveness in
              today's technological society.  ***
