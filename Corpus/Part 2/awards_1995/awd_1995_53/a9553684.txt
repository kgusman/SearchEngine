Abstract    :
                   To provide employees skilled in metrology and ISO 9001 to the  engineering,
              manufacturing, and service/installation industries.   To achieve this goal, a
              collaboration will be established between  the Machine Tool Program at Madison
              Area Technical College, the  suppliers and users of precision measuring, the
              University of WI  Center for Quality and Productivity Improvement, the Madison 
              Metropolitan School District, and the WI School-To-Work  Initiatives; and also
              articulation of participation from other  secondary and postsecondary
              educational institutions and  professional organizations.  This proposal is to
              be a  well-coordinated, highly integrated effort to:  1) Develop and 
              disseminate curriculum materials specifically designed for  technical training
              at the two-year associate degree level; 2)  Provide teacher enhancement
              activities in advanced dimensional  metrology and ISO 9001 that include summer
              institutes, mentoring  and curriculum development partnerships for associate
              degree and  secondary level school teachers; and 3) Support the development and
               coordination of industry-led statewide programs to offer work-based 
              experiences for high school students; and 4) Assemble a mobile  metrology
              laboratory to provide student education, teacher  enhancement, and calibration
              of precision measuring tools.  The  proposed program will link together the
              development of  instructional materials with faculty enhancement, student 
              laboratory experience and school-to-work initiatives.
