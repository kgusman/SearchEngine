Abstract    :
                   The New Jersey Consortium for Advanced Technological Education  proposes to
              restructure engineering technology education beginning  in grade eleven in
              secondary school through the associate degree  with articulation with
              baccalaureate institutions.  Just as the  engineer of today must be
              knowledgeable in more than one area and  must be able to learn other fields
              quickly, the diversified  technological environment of today requires a new
              engineering  technician who has a thorough understanding of the mechanics, 
              electronics, and computer hardware and software that drive the  modern
              workplace.  In engineering, one response to the need for  cross-disciplinary
              knowledge was the creation of a "mechatronics"  engineering discipline.        
              In engineering technology, Mecomtronics, a new program to be  created under
              this plan, will respond to the widespread demand for  a multifunctional
              engineering technician.  As the result of an  intensive planning process, the
              New Jersey Consortium for Advanced  Technological Education (a partnership of
              community colleges,  baccalaureate institutions and school districts) will
              establish a  center for engineering technology education that will:        
              create and implement an integrated Mecomtronics (MEchanical/      
              COMputer/teleCOMmunications/elecTRONlCS) Associate Degree       program;       
               develop and integrate curriculum and instructional materials       based on an
              interdisciplinary, project-centered, collaborative       learning approach to
              instruction;         restructure existing engineering technology programs;     
                 expand existing Tech Prep relationships with high schools and      
              articulation agreements with baccalaureate institutions;         establish a
              meaningful       business/industry education professional association      
              partnership;         incorporate quality principles into engineering technology
                    curriculum;         develop and implement strategies for faculty
              professional       development;         adapt and develop model p rograms and
              strategies to increase       enrollment and success of students, particularly
              those from       underrepresented populations;         implement an electronic
              and print engineering technology       education communications network;       
               enhance the professional status of technician careers;         evaluate the
              impact of Center activities on engineering       technology education.       At
              the end of the five-year project, not only will the  Consortium have created a
              new engineering technology discipline  that responds to the needs of industry
              and students, but it will  also have had a profound positive impact on the
              entire field of  engineering technology education.  In each year of the
              project,  interrelated curriculum, materials development, faculty development 
              and student outreach activities will result in achievements that  are
              measurable and sustainable.
