Abstract    :
              GER-9553460  Stith  The Ohio State University Physics  Department is submitting
              a proposal  to the National Science Foundation  under the NSF Graduate Research
               Traineeship Program. Our proposal  is that five Graduate Research  Trainees be
              funded each year for  five years. These students will  work to earn PhD's in
              physics with  specialties in physics education  research. Their training will
              focus  on the theory and methods of  teaching and learning in physics  and on
              the use of technology to  enhance that learning. These  efforts will involve
              collaborations  with several private companies. The  five specific objectives
              of our  proposal are as follows.  A) To produce PhD physics graduates  who
              develop the research and  teaching skills and the knowledge  about cognition
              and learning that  will prepare them to lead future  efforts to improve science
               education in the United States.  B) To produce PhD physics graduates  who gain
              the knowledge and develop  the skills to produce and implement  effective
              systems of learning based  in part on the use of technology.  C) To increase
              the number of  talented PhD physics graduates from  traditionally
              underrepresented  groups who have this knowledge and  these skills.  D) To
              increase the number of PhD  physics graduates trained in all  areas of physics
              who also have the  knowledge of physics education  research to implement new
              forms of  instruction in the education  systems in which they may work in  the
              future.  E) To help produce a positive  systemic change in the learning  system
              of a state university with  over 50,000 students --a change  that better
              prepares these  undergraduate students for the  twenty-first century
              information-  age workplace.  We propose that the five Graduate  Research
              Traineeships be funded in  physics at OSU each year for five  years. The cost
              to the NSF for  these Traineeships will be $112,500  per year. Ohio State
              University's  matching contribution of $27,000  per year will be realized by
              paying  the tuition of the NSF support ed  trainees in excess of $8400 per 
              year and in $100 per year of  miscellaneous support and travel  for the
              trainees.
