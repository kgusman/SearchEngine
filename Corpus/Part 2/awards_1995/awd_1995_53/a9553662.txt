              Sensing, Image Processing, and Geographic Information  Systems          
              Community Colleges for Innovative Technology Transfer, Inc.  (CCITT), a
              consortium of 12 community colleges across the United  States, all linked with
              a local NASA Center, is conducting six  faculty development workshops (two
              each) in remote sensing, image  processing, and geographic information systems.
               An earth systems  science course with a self-standing laboratory utilizing
              remote  sensing, image processing, and geographic information systems is  being
              developed as well as an interdisciplinary curriculum module  having multiple
              strands which utilize the technologies above.  The  interdisciplinary modules
              can be infused into science and  technology courses at CCITT institutions and
              other community  colleges throughout the United States.           Community
              college members of CCITT include:  Brevard Community  College, FL, Cuyahoga
              Community College, OH, Foothill-DeAnza  Community College District, CA, John C.
              Calhoun Community College,  AL, Pasadena City College, CA, Pearl River
              Community College, MS,  Prince George's Community College, MD, Thomas Nelson
              Community  College, VA, and Houston, TX-based Consortium for Aeronautical 
              Technical Education composed of San Jacinto Community College,  College of the
              Mainland, Alvin College, and Lee College.           NASA Headquarters and local
              NASA Centers are supporting the  faculty development/curriculum work. The
              remote sensing workshop is  being held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in
              Greenbelt,  Maryland with a portion of the instruction being provided by NASA 
              scientists and engineers.  Scie ntists from AMES are involved with  the two
              image processing workshops to be held at Foothill College.   Individuals from
              academe and industry with GIS experience support  the two GIS workshops.
