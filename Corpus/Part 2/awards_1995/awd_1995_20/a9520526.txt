Abstract    :
              9520526  Neuman  The goal of this research is to develop inexpensive 
              instrumentation for the detection of bacterial vaginosis  (BV) in the patients
              home.  This instrumentation is to be  based upon new sensor technology
              resulting from research at  the Duke-North Carolina Engineering Research Center
              for  Emerging Cardiovascular Technologies support by the National  Science
              Foundation.  The investigator's goal is to develop  low-cost
              microelectronics-based biomedical sensors for  accurate detecting of bacterial
              vaginosis with an  intravaginal probe.  A tampon-like disposable probe will be 
              developed in two forms-one with electrical connection to a  linear eternal
              electronic readout (a microcomputer) for the  doctor's office and another self
              contained unit (battery  operated) for home testing for BV infections.    The
              multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research team  is quite impressive
              and the impressive investigators have  extensive experience in the areas
              necessary for completing  the work plan.    The project involves
              multidisciplinary interactions from  three universities.  Fundamental chemistry
              studies and  development of the biosensors will be carried out in the 
              Department  of Chemistry at the University of North  Carolina; microelectronics
              fabrication of sensors will use  facilities of the Case Western Reserve
              University and North  Carolina State University; economic modeling will be done
              at  Duke University and Case.  The potential for cost reduction  is through the
              development of simple technology for  detecting BV that will reduce the cost of
              diagnosis as well  as reducing treatment costs resulting from nonspecific 
              diagnosis.  ***
