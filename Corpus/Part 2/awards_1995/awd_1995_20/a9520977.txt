Abstract    :
              9520977  Bardet  On January 17, 1995, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck the city
               of Kobe in Japan, and inflicted the worst natural disaster to  Japan since the
              1923 Tokyo Earthquake.    Some of the 10,000 buildings toppled by the quake
              were modern  structures. The modern port of Kobe was completely shut down, 
              mainly due to massive liquefaction of the soil foundations for  its wharves and
              container yards. The infrastructure of Kobe,  including railways, Shinkansen
              lines, expressways, and subways  was heavily damaged. There were more than 30
              bridge failures in  the Hyogo Prefecture. The lifelines, including electricity,
              gas,  and water were severely disrupted in the city of Kobe.    Such a large
              scale disaster confronts engineers with the  devastating effects of an
              intensity 7 earthquake in a populated  area. The damage to Kobe transportation
              systems rendered access  difficult. Owing to the transportation problems and
              the large  scale damage to Kobe, foreign reconnaissance teams experienced 
              difficulties in assessing the earthquake damage.  There are many  geotechnical
              lessons to learn from this earthquake which can be  used to  avoid similar
              catastrophes in the US.    The objective of this project is to collaborate with
              the Japanese  reconnaissance teams in order to collect and release data about 
              the geotechnical features of the South Hyogo Prefecture  Earthquake, using the
              modern and efficient means of Internet  communication.  This new means of
              communication not only speeds  up the dissemination of critical information,
              but it also  promotes the exchange of information between US and Japan 
              earthquake engineers.    The Japanese Society of Soil Mechanics and Foundations
              has agreed  to collaborate with the principal investigator on the translation 
              of the Japanese reports into English, and to put these translated  reports on
              the GEOTECH Internet subscriber list and Mosaic Server  of the Southern
              California Earthquake Center. The information  will contain digitized strong
              motion recordings, map s, aerial  photographs, and photographs taken during
              field observations. All  this information will be made available to the US
              earthquake  engineering community as rapidly as possible in order to inform 
              them in a timely manner, and to help  them to take appropriate research actions
              to learn as much as is  possible from the South Hyogo Prefecture Earthquake.
