Abstract    :
              9520204  Sitar  The January 17, 1995, Hyogo Nanbu Earthquake in Japan caused 
              extensive damage in the port city of Kobe, in adjacent  Osaka, and even in more
              distant Kyoto.  Over 5000 people  died, with thousands of dwellings and other
              structures  destroyed, and with close to 300,000 people displaced.  Preliminary
              damage estimates  place this event as the most  costly natural disaster in
              Japan in this century.  The  geologic setting, topography, and the level and
              the type of  development in the affected area suggest that there is a  great
              similarity to the San Francisco Bay area, and  specifically to the region along
              the Hayward Fault.  It is  also apparent that the geotechnical aspects of the 
              earthquake are quite significant.  Experience from the two  most recent
              California earthquakes, Loma Prieta and  Northridge, shows that it is critical
              that as much  information as possible be gathered and documented in the 
              immediate aftermath of an event, since the geotechnical data  is often highly
              perishable.  The objective of this research  effort is to perform a
              geotechnical reconnaissance of the  affected region, and to gather and document
              as much data  associated with the geotechnical aspects of the earthquake  as
              logistically possible.  Particular focus is directed  towards assessing the
              following: (1) liquefaction and ground  compaction, and associated ground
              displacement, (2) effect  of local soil conditions on ground surface shaking 
              characteristics and damage patters, (3) seismic response of  natural slopes,
              (4) the seismic response of earth  structures, and structural fills, (5) the
              influence of soil  conditions on the performance of port facilities, and (6) 
              the effect of surface rupture on damage to structures and  lifelines.  The
              reconnaissance is being planned in  cooperation with the leading geotechnical
              earthquake  engineers in Japan.  The team will promptly report its  findings
              tot he U.S. research community; especially via new  Internet Mosaic servers at
              the University of Southern  Ca lifornia and the University of California at
              Berkeley -  servers set up specifically to share information within the 
              geotechnical earthquake engineering community.  ***
