Abstract    :
              9520734  Allan  Since the 1960's ecologists have debated whether communities are
              controlled by predators consuming members lower on the trophic chain
              (top-down), or by foundational nutrients defining the food chain from the
              bottom-up. Although previously polarized, a synthesis of the two approaches has
              recently emerged. In line with this more sophisticated analysis, Hunter and
              Price asserted that further recognition of the functional heterogeneity
              inherent within each trophic level is warranted. Preliminary data from Costa
              Rica's coastal forests suggest that the herbivorous land crabs may
              significantly influence seedling communities from both trophic directions. Land
              crabs form extensive and dense aggregations on the forest floor where they
              consume certain species of seedlings and fallen leaves. By selectively
              consuming seedlings, land crabs may directly influence seedling community
              structure from the top-down. By relocating leaf litter from the soil surface to
              their subterranean burrows, land crabs may indirectly influence seedling
              survivorship form the bottom-up as they alter the seedlings' chemical and
              physical micro-environments.    The investigations proposed in this
              dissertation research will contribute to the nascent top down/bottom up
              synthesis by experimentally testing the heterogeneous influence of land crabs
              on the seedling community.
