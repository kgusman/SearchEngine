Abstract    :
              9520456  Starrett       Current trends in power system regulation and planning
              are  causing complex, unpredictable, nonlinear phenomenon to limit the 
              economic operation of power systems.  The analysis and  computations required
              to ensure that the system will operate  within its reliability criteria are
              becoming increasingly  difficult and time consuming.  The resulting data is
              often hard  to interpret.  The goal of this research is to develop computer- 
              based expert systems to:  process data, identify patterns,  classify system
              conditions according to expected problems,  suggest scheduling or control
              changes, and control the system.   Artificial neural networks (ANN's) are
              useful for pattern  recognition and data classification.  Depending on the type
              of  network used, ANN's can be trained to give a desired output under  certain
              conditions, or they can be allowed to recognize patterns  in data without
              pre-defined output specifications.  An ANN  advisory system is proposed that
              will monitor system data,  process patterns and warn the operator of dangerous
              system  conditions.  Fuzzy logic systems formulate output decisions based  on
              sets of rules that apply within ranges of system conditions.   Thus they can
              efficiently deal with uncertain conditions and a  range of operating points. 
              The classification results of the  neural networks can be used to form a
              flexible, yet predictable  control system using fuzzy logic control.   The
              ANN/fuzzy logic  system will be designed to allow adjustments in response to 
              changing power system conditions.  ***
