Abstract    :
              9520626    Flying  insects  vary in the metabolic  fuels  they  use  to  support
              energetically costly flight.  Flies and bees usually  use  sugars  to  fuel
              flight,  while moths  and  butterflies  usually use fat stores. This research
              will examine metabolic  physiology at several levels in a hawkmoth whose heavy
              body,  narrow  wings  and  rapid flight impose high  flight  costs. 
              Measurement  of  rates  of  oxygen  consumption  and  carbon  dioxide 
              production  during  flight  will  indicate  whether  sugars or fats are being
              oxidized.   Moths that have fed  on  sugar-rich  nectar  will be compared  with
               unfed  moths  to  determine  whether fuel use varies with nutritional  status.
               Maximum   reaction  rates  of  catabolic  enzymes   in   the  carbohydrate 
              and  lipid burning pathways of  flight  muscle  will   be  assayed  to 
              determine  how  feeding  and  flight  performance  relate  to  the  moth's 
              underlying   metabolic  biochemistry.  Stable  isotope  analysis  will  be 
              used  to  characterize the contribution of larvally-obtained and adult- 
              obtained  resources to egg provisioning.  The research  will  improve  
              understanding  of  the  constraints  on   activity  metabolism and the relative
              importance of metabolic capacity  and  fuel  availability  in limiting
              performance.   Improved  understanding of the way energy is allocated between 
              flight  and  reproduction  may  increase our  understanding  of  the 
              population dynamics of flying insects.
