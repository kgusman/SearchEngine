Abstract    :
              9520752    Atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to double within  the  next  
              80   years  due  to  burning  of  fossil  fuels   and  deforestation of
              tropical rainforests.  Analyses of  ancient  air  trapped  within ice have
              shown that atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  may  have been as low as 50% of the 
              current  level  approximately  20,000 years ago.  We know that  many  plants 
              increase  growth  and  reproduction when  grown  under  high  carbon  dioxide 
              and decrease growth and  reproduction  when  grown  under  low  carbon dioxide.
                We  know  very  little,  however,  about  the  evolutionary responses  of 
              plants  to  changing  levels  of  carbon dioxide.  That  information  is 
              needed  to:  a)  accurately predict  plant  responses  under  future  scenarios
              of high carbon dioxide, b) understand  how  plants survived during low carbon
              dioxide levels of the past  and  c)  determine the processes by which plants 
              evolve  in  response  to  changing  levels  of  carbon  dioxide.    This 
              research will use the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a  model  system to
              study the evolutionary responses of  plants  under  low  and  high  carbon
              dioxide.   It  will  determine  whether  individual  plants show  variation  in
               growth  and  reproduction under low and high carbon dioxide  and  examine  the
               response  of  populations to  selection  for  increased  reproduction  under
              low and high carbon  dioxide.   It  will  test  to see whether such selection
              produces plants with  an  adaptive  advantage  and  determine what 
              physiological  and  developmental  processes are associated  with  evolution 
              of  plants  in  response to carbon dioxide.  This research  will  increase our
              understanding of the processes by which  plants  adapt  to changing carbon
              dioxide levels over geologic time,  and  improve  our  ability  to predict  and
               understand  the  changes  that plants may undergo due to human-caused changes 
              in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
